# textstat_tools

This repository containts the data, code, labs, lab sets, and report templates which is used in Special Topics: Text Analysis (36-468/668).

Cloning this repository will allow users to run the necessary code and access the files from an [RProject](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/rstudio-projects-for-beginners/).

After cloning the repository, a user should simply open the `textstat_tools.Rproj` file in R Studio. That will automatically set the working directory to the project folder.

The labs can be accessed by using the **Files** tab in R studio. Because of the nature of RProjects, **NO** paths need to be edited, unless a lab calls for you to download additional data (from Canvas, for example).
