# textstat_tools

This repository containts the "unpackaged" version of **[cmu.teststat](https://cmu-textstat-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**, which is used in Special Topics: Text Analysis (36-468/668).

In lieu of a package, cloning this repository will allow users to run the same code and access the same[]() data from an [RProject](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/rstudio-projects-for-beginners/).

After cloning the repository, a user should simply open the `textstat_tools.Rproj` file in R Studio. That will automatically set the working directory to the project folder.

The labs can be accessed by using the **Files** tab in R studio. All the labs are locating in the **Rmd** folder. Because of the nature of RProjects, **NO** paths need to be edited, unless a lab calls for you to download additional data (from Canvas, for example).

---
**NOTE**

Even if you are choosing to run the code from the **textstat_tools** Rproject, the labs are the same, except for a few additoinal code blocks that call functions or load data.

Thus, [the elaborated explanations of the labs](https://cmu-textstat-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labs/lab_overview.html) are just as useful as they would be if you were executing code directly from the R package.
