Enter King John, Queen Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, Salisbury, and Others, with Chatillon.

<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?

</K_JOHN>
<CHATILLON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France,
	In my behaviour, to the majesty,
	The borrow'd majesty of England here.

<CHATILLON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Philip of France, in right and true behalf
	Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
	Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
	To this fair island and the territories,
	To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine;
	Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
	Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
	And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
	Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.

</CHATILLON>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What follows if we disallow of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<CHATILLON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
	To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

</CHATILLON>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
	Controlment for controlment: so answer France.

	Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
	The furthest limit of my embassy.

<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
	Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
	For ere thou canst report I will be there,
	The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
	So, hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
	And sullen presage of your own decay.
	An honourable conduct let him have:

	<DIALOGUE>
	What men are you?
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
	Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,

	A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
	Of Coeur-de-Lion knighted in the field.

</BASTARD>
<K_JOHN>

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.

</ROBERT>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
	You came not of one mother then, it seems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most certain of one mother, mighty king,
	That is well known: and, as I think, one father:
	But for the certain knowledge of that truth
	I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
	Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTARD>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
	And wound her honour with this diffidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
	That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
	The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
	At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
	Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTARD>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
	Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not why, except to get the land.
	But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
	But whe'r I be as true-begot or no,
	That still I lay upon my mother's head;
	But that I am as well-begot, my liege,--
	Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
	Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
	If old Sir Robert did beget us both,
	And were our father, and this son like him;
	O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
	I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

</BASTARD>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath a trick of Coeur-de-Lion's face;
	The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
	Do you not read some tokens of my son
	In the large composition of this man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine eye hath well examined his parts,
	And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak:
	What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
	With half that face would he have all my land;
	A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTARD>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
	Your brother did employ my father much,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
	Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTARD>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
	To Germany, there with the emperor
	To treat of high affairs touching that time.
	The advantage of his absence took the king,
	And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
	Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
	But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
	Between my father and my mother lay,--
	As I have heard my father speak himself,--
	When this same lusty gentleman was got.
	Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
	His lands to me, and took it on his death
	That this my mother's son was none of his;
	An if he were, he came into the world
	Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
	Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
	My father's land, as was my father's will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
	Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
	And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
	Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
	That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
	Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
	Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
	This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
	In sooth he might: then, if he were my brother's,
	My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
	Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
	My mother's son did get your father's heir;
	Your father's heir must have your father's land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall then my father's will be of no force
	To dispossess that child which is not his?

	Madam, an if my brother had my shape,

	That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
	Lest men should say, 'Look, where three-far-things goes!'
	And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,

	A foot of honour better than I was,
	But many a many foot of land the worse.
	Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
	'Good den, Sir Richard!' 'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
	And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
	For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
	'Tis too respective and too sociable
	For your conversion. Now your traveller,
	He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
	And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
	Why then I suck my teeth, and catechize
	My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'--
	Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,--
	'I shall beseech you,'--that is question now;
	And then comes answer like an absey-book:
	'O, sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
	At your employment; at your service, sir:'
	'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
	And so, ere answer knows what question would,
	Saving in dialogue of compliment,
	And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
	The Pyrenean and the river Po,
	It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
	But this is worshipful society
	And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
	For he is but a bastard to the time,
	That doth not smack of observation;
	And so am I, whether I smack or no;
	And not alone in habit and device,
	Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
	But from the inward motion to deliver
	Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
	Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
	Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
	For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
	But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
	What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
	That will take pains to blow a horn before her

	Subjected tribute to commanding love,

	Then turn your forces from this paltry siege

	But on the sight of us your lawful king,--

	Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
	To save unscratch'd your city's threaten'd cheeks,--
	Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle;
	And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
	To make a shaking fever in your walls,
	They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
	To make a faithless error in your ears:

	For this down-trodden equity, we tread

	In the relief of this oppressed child,
	Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
	To pay that duty which you truly owe
	To him that owes it, namely, this young prince;
	And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
	Save in aspect, have all offence seal'd up;
	Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
	Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
	And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
	With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd,

	And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.
	But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
	'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls
	Can hide you from our messengers of war,
	Though all these English and their discipline
	Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.

	Married in league, coupled and link'd together
	With all religious strength of sacred vows;
	The latest breath that gave the sound of words

	Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;
	And even before this truce, but new before,
	No longer than we well could wash our hands
	To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
	Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and overstain'd
	With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
	The fearful difference of incensed kings:
	And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,
	So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
	Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
	Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
	Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
	As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
	Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
	Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
	And make a riot on the gentle brow
	Of true sincerity? O! holy sir,
	My reverend father, let it not be so!
	Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose

	First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd;
	That is, to be the champion of our church.
	What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
	And may not be performed by thyself;
	For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
	Is not amiss when it is truly done;
	And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
	The truth is then most done not doing it.
	The better act of purposes mistook
	Is to mistake again; though indirect,
	Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
	And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
	Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
	It is religion that doth make vows kept;
	But thou hast sworn against religion
	By what thou swear'st, against the thing thou swear'st,
	And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
	Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
	To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
	Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
	But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
	And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
	Therefore thy later vows against thy first
	Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
	And better conquest never canst thou make
	Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
	Against these giddy loose suggestions:
	Upon which better part our prayers come in,
	If thou vouchsafe them; but, if not, then know
	The peril of our curses light on thee
	So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
	But in despair die under their black weight.

	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
	Sound one into the drowsy race of night;
	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
	Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
	A passion hateful to my purposes;
	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
	Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,

	But now I envy at their liberty,
	And will again commit them to their bonds,
	Because my poor child is a prisoner.
	And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
	That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.
	If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
	For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
	To him that did but yesterday suspire,
	There was not such a gracious creature born.
	But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
	And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
	And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
	As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
	And so he'll die; and, rising so again,

	Mercy on me!
	Methinks nobody should be sad but I:
	Yet I remember, when I was in France,
	Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
	Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
	So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
	I should be as merry as the day is long;
	And so I would be here, but that I doubt
	My uncle practises more harm to me:
	He is afraid of me, and I of him.
	Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
	No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven
	I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.

	Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.

</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
	I knit my handkercher about your brows,--
	The best I had, a princess wrought it me,--
	And I did never ask it you again;
	And with my hand at midnight held your head,
	And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
	Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
	Saying, 'What lack you?' and, 'Where lies your grief?'
	Or, 'What good love may I perform for you?'
	Many a poor man's son would have lain still,
	And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
	But you at your sick-service had a prince.
	Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
	And call it cunning: do an if you will.
	If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill,
	Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
	These eyes that never did nor never shall
	So much as frown on you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<HUBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have sworn to do it;
	And with hot irons must I burn them out.

</HUBERT>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! none but in this iron age would do it!
	The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
	Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
	And quench this fiery indignation
	Even in the matter of mine innocence;
	Nay, after that, consume away in rust,
	But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
	Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
	An if an angel should have come to me
	And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
	I would not have believ'd him; no tongue but Hubert's.

	Nay, hear me, Hubert: drive these men away,
	And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;

	Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.

</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Same. A Room of State in the Palace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter King John, crowned; Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lords. The King takes his state.
</DIRECTION>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
	And look'd upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This 'once again,' but that your highness pleas'd,
	Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
	And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
	The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
	Fresh expectation troubled not the land
	With any long'd-for change or better state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
	To guard a title that was rich before,
	To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
	To throw a perfume on the violet,
	To smooth the ice, or add another hue
	Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
	To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
	Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that your royal pleasure must be done,
	This act is as an ancient tale new told,
	And in the last repeating troublesome,
	Being urged at a time unseasonable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In this the antique and well-noted face
	Of plain old form is much disfigured;
	And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
	It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
	Startles and frights consideration,
	Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
	For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When workmen strive to do better than well
	They do confound their skill in covetousness;
	And oftentimes excusing of a fault
	Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse:
	As patches set upon a little breach
	Discredit more in hiding of the fault
	Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To this effect, before you were newcrown'd,
	We breath'd our counsel: but it pleas'd your highness
	To overbear it, and we are all well pleas'd;
	Since all and every part of what we would
	Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALISBURY>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some reasons of this double coronation
	I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
	And more, more strong,--when lesser is my fear,--
	I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
	What you would have reform'd that is not well;
	And well shall you perceive how willingly
	I will both hear and grant you your requests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I,--as one that am the tongue of these
	To sound the purposes of all their hearts,--
	Both for myself and them,--but, chief of all,
	Your safety, for the which myself and them
	Bend their best studies,--heartily request
	The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
	Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
	To break into this dangerous argument:
	If what in rest you have in right you hold,
	Why then your fears,--which, as they say, attend
	The steps of wrong,--should move you to mew up
	Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days
	With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth
	The rich advantage of good exercise?
	That the time's enemies may not have this
	To grace occasions, let it be our suit
	That you have bid us ask, his liberty;
	Which for our goods we do no further ask
	Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
	Counts it your weal he have his liberty.

</PEMBROKE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Hubert.

</K_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Taking him apart.
</DIRECTION>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the man should do the bloody deed;
	He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
	The image of a wicked hemous fault
	Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
	Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
	And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
	What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEMBROKE>
<SALISBURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The colour of the king doth come and go
	Between his purpose and his conscience,
	Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
	His passion is so ripe it needs must break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
	The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEMBROKE>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
	Good lords, although my will to give is living,
	The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
	He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.

<SALISBURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed we heard how near his death he was
	Before the child himself felt he was sick:
	This must be answer'd, either here or hence.

</PEMBROKE>
<K_JOHN>

	Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
	Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

</SALISBURY>
<PEMBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
	And find the inheritance of this poor child,
	His little kingdom of a forced grave.
	That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle,
	Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!

	But as I travell'd hither through the land,
	I find the people strangely fantasied,
	Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
	Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear.
	And here's a prophet that I brought with me
	From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
	With many hundreds treading on his heels;
	To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rimes,
	That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
	Your highness should deliver up your crown.

<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five moons!
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<HUBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old men and beldams in the streets
	Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
	Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;
	And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
	And whisper one another in the ear;
	And he that speaks, doth gripe the hearer's wrist
	Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
	With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
	I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
	The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
	With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
	Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
	Standing on slippers,--which his nimble haste
	Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,--
	Told of a many thousand warlike French,
	That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.
	Another lean unwash'd artificer
	Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUBERT>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
	Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
	Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
	To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HUBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?

<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the curse of kings to be attended
	By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
	To break within the bloody house of life,
	And on the winking of authority
	To understand a law, to know the meaning
	Of dangerous majesty, when, perchance, it frowns
	More upon humour than advis'd respect.

	O! when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
	Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
	Witness against us to damnation.
	How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
	Makes ill deeds done! Hadst not thou been by,
	A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
	Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
	This murder had not come into my mind;
	But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
	Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
	Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
	I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
	And thou, to be endeared to a king,
	Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_JOHN>
<HUBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUBERT>
<K_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
	When I spake darkly what I purposed,
	Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
	As bid me tell my tale in express words,
	Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
	And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
	But thou didst understand me by my signs
	And didst in signs again parley with sin;
	Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,

	The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.
	Out of my sight, and never see me more!

	Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine

	Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
	Within this bosom never enter'd yet
	The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;

	Forgive the comment that my passion made
	Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
	And foul imaginary eyes of blood
	Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
	O! answer not; but to my closet bring

	Now powers from home and discontents at home
	Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,--
	As doth a raven on a sick-fallen beast,--
	The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
	Now happy he whose cloak and ceinture can

	That borrow their behaviours from the great,
	Grow great by your example and put on
	The dauntless spirit of resolution.
	Away! and glister like the god of war
	When he intendeth to become the field:
	Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
	What! shall they seek the lion in his den

	Cries out upon the name of Salisbury.
	But such is the infection of the time,

	We cannot deal but with the very hand
	Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
	And is't not pity, O my grieved friends!
	That we, the sons and children of this isle,
	Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
	Wherein we step after a stranger march
	Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
	Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
	Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
	To grace the gentry of a land remote,
	And follow unacquainted colours here?
	What, here? O nation! that thou couldst remove;
	That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
	Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,

	Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
	That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
	My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
	Being an ordinary inundation;
	But this effusion of such manly drops,
	This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
	Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amaz'd
	Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
	Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors.
	Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
	And with a great heart heave away this storm:
	Commend these waters to those baby eyes
	That never saw the giant world enrag'd;
	Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
	Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
	Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep

	The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd

	That so stood out against the holy church,
	The great metropolis and see of Rome.
	Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up,
	And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
	That, like a lion foster'd up at hand,
	It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
	And be no further harmful than in show.

	To any sovereign state throughout the world.
	Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
	Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself,
	And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
	And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
	With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
	You taught me how to know the face of right,
	Acquainted me with interest to this land,
	Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;

	His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
	I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
	After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
	And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
	Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
	Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
	What men provided, what munition sent,
	To underprop this action? is't not I
	That undergo this charge? who else but I,
	And such as to my claim are liable,
	Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
	Have I not heard these islanders shout out,
	Vive le roy! as I have bank'd their towns?
	Have I not here the best cards for the game
	To win this easy match play'd for a crown?

<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to the fair play of the world,
	Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
	My holy Lord of Milan, from the king
	I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
	And, as you answer, I do know the scope
	And warrant limited unto my tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASTARD>
<PANDULPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
	And will not temporize with my entreaties:
	He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDULPH>
<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
	The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
	For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
	He is prepar'd; and reason too he should:
	This apish and unmannerly approach,
	This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
	This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
	The king doth smile at; and is well prepar'd
	To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
	From out the circle of his territories.
	That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
	To cudgel you and make you take the hatch;
	To dive, like buckets, in concealed wells;
	To crouch in litter of your stable planks:
	To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks;
	To hug with swine; to seek sweet safety out
	In vaults and prisons; and to thrill and shake,
	Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
	Thinking this voice an armed Englishman:
	Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
	That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
	No! Know, the gallant monarch is in arms,
	And like an eagle o'er his aiery towers,
	To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
	And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
	You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
	Of your dear mother England, blush for shame:
	For your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids
	Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
	Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
	Their neelds to lances, and their gentle hearts
	To fierce and bloody inclination.

<LEWIS>

<BASTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
	And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start
	An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
	And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
	That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
	Sound but another, and another shall
	As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
	And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,--
	Not trusting to this halting legate here,
	Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need,--
	Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
	A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
	To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

	Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
	For if the French be lords of this loud day,
	He means to recompense the pains you take
	By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,
	And I with him, and many moe with me,
	Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;

	Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
	Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
	What in the world should make me now deceive,
	Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
	Why should I then be false, since it is true
	That I must die here and live hence by truth?
	I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
	He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
	Behold another day break in the east:
	But even this night, whose black contagious breath
	Already smokes about the burning crest
	Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
	Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
	Paying the fine of rated treachery
	Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
	If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
	Commend me to one Hubert with your king;
	The love of him, and this respect besides,
	For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
	Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
	In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
	From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
	Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
	In peace, and part this body and my soul
	With contemplation and devout desires.

	We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
	But I do love the favour and the form
	Of this most fair occasion, by the which
	We will untread the steps of damned flight,
	And like a bated and retired flood,
	Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
	Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,
	And calmly run on in obedience,
	Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
	My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
	For I do see the cruel pangs of death
	Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;

	With many legions of strange fantasies,
	Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
	Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing.
	I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
