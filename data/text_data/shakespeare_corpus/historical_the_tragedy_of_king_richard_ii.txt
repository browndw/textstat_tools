<DIRECTION>
Enter King Richard, attended; John of Gaunt, and other Nobles.
</DIRECTION>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
	Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
	Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
	Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
	Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have, my liege.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
	If he appeal the duke on ancient malice,
	Or worthily, as a good subject should,
	On some known ground of treachery in him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As near as I could sift him on that argument,
	On some apparent danger seen in him
	Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then call them to our presence: face to face,
	And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
	The accuser and the accused freely speak
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt some Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
	In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Attendants, with Bolingbroke and Mowbray.
</DIRECTION>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Many years of happy days befall
	My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLINGBROKE>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each day still better other's happiness;
	Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
	Add an immortal title to your crown!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
	As well appeareth by the cause you come;
	Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.
	Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First,--heaven be the record to my speech!--
	In the devotion of a subject's love,
	Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
	And free from other misbegotten hate,
	Come I appellant to this princely presence.
	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
	And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
	My body shall make good upon this earth,
	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant;
	Too good to be so and too bad to live,
	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
	With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
	What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLINGBROKE>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
	'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
	The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
	Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
	The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
	Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
	As to be hush'd and nought at all to say.
	First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
	From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
	Which else would post until it had return'd
	These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
	Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
	And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
	I do defy him, and I spit at him;
	Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
	Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
	And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
	Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
	Or any other ground inhabitable,
	Wherever Englishman durst set his foot.
	Meantime let this defend my loyalty:
	By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
	Disclaiming here the kindred of the king;
	And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except:
	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
	As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
	By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,
	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
	What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLINGBROKE>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it up; and by that sword I swear,
	Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
	I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
	Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
	And when I mount, alive may I not light,
	If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
	It must be great that can inherit us
	So much as of a thought of ill in him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
	That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
	In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
	The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
	Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
	Besides I say and will in battle prove,
	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
	That ever was survey'd by English eye,
	That all the treasons for these eighteen years
	Complotted and contrived in this land,
	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
	Further I say and further will maintain
	Upon his bad life to make all this good,
	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
	Suggest his soon believing adversaries,
	And consequently, like a traitor coward,
	Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
	Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
	To me for justice and rough chastisement;
	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLINGBROKE>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How high a pitch his resolution soars!
	Thomas of Norfolk, what sayst thou to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! let my sovereign turn away his face
	And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
	Till I have told this slander of his blood
	How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
	Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,--
	As he is but my father's brother's son,--
	Now, by my sceptre's awe I make a vow,
	Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
	Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
	The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.
	He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
	Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
	Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
	Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
	Disburs'd I duly to his highness' soldiers;
	The other part reserv'd I by consent,
	For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
	Upon remainder of a dear account,
	Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.
	Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
	I slew him not; but to mine own disgrace
	Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
	For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
	The honourable father to my foe,
	Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
	A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
	But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament
	I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
	Your Grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
	This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd,
	It issues from the rancour of a villain,
	A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
	Which in myself I boldly will defend,
	And interchangeably hurl down my gage
	Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
	To prove myself a loyal gentleman
	Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
	In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
	Your highness to assign our trial day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;
	Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
	This we prescribe, though no physician;
	Deep malice makes too deep incision:
	Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed,
	Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
	Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
	We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be a make-peace shall become my age:
	Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, Norfolk, throw down his.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When, Harry, when?
	Obedience bids I should not bid again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
	My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
	The one my duty owes; but my fair name,--
	Despite of death that lives upon my grave,--
	To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
	I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffled here,
	Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
	The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
	Which breath'd this poison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rage must be withstood:
	Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<MOWBRAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame,
	And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
	The purest treasure mortal times afford
	Is spotless reputation; that away,
	Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
	A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
	Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
	Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;
	Take honour from me, and my life is done:
	Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
	In that I live and for that will I die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOWBRAY>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin, throw down your gage: do you begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! God defend my soul from such deep sin.
	Shall I seem crest fall'n in my father's sight,
	Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
	Before this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my tongue
	Shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong,
	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
	The slavish motive of recanting fear,
	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
	Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Exit Gaunt.
</DIRECTION>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were not born to sue, but to command:
	Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
	Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
	At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
	There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
	The swelling difference of your settled hate:
	Since we cannot atone you, we shall see
	Justice design the victor's chivalry.
	Marshal, command our officers-at-arms
	Be ready to direct these home alarms.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Gaunt and Duchess of Gloucester.
</DIRECTION>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! the part I had in Woodstock's blood
	Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
	To stir against the butchers of his life.
	But since correction lieth in those hands
	Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
	Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
	Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
	Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
	Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
	Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
	Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
	Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
	Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
	Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
	But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
	One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
	One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
	Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;
	Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all vaded,
	By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
	Ah, Gaunt! his blood was thine: that bed, that womb,
	That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
	Made him a man; and though thou liv'st and breath'st,
	Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
	In some large measure to thy father's death
	In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
	Who was the model of thy father's life.
	Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
	In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
	Thou show'st the naked pathway to thy life,
	Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
	That which in mean men we entitle patience
	Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
	What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
	The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUCHESS>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
	His deputy anointed in his sight,
	Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully,
	Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift
	An angry arm against his minister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where then, alas! may I complain myself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUCHESS>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To God, the widow's champion and defence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
	Thou go'st to Coventry, there to behold
	Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
	O! sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
	That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast.
	Or if misfortune miss the first career,
	Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
	That they may break his foaming courser's back,
	And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
	A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
	Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
	With her companion grief must end her life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUCHESS>
<GAUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.
	As much good stay with thee as go with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAUNT>
<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet one word more. Grief boundeth where it falls,
	Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
	I take my leave before I have begun,
	For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
	Commend me to my brother, Edmund York.
	Lo! this is all: nay, yet depart not so;
	Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
	I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
	With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
	Alack! and what shall good old York there see
	But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
	Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
	And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
	Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
	To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
	Desolate, desolate will I hence, and die:
	The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

	Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' swords;
	And for we think the eagle-winged pride
	Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
	With rival-hating envy, set on you
	To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
	Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;

	With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,

	The language I have learn'd these forty years,
	My native English, now I must forego;
	And now my tongue's use is to me no more
	Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
	Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up,
	Or, being open, put into his hands
	That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
	Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
	Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
	And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance
	Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
	I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,

	Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour,
	And not the king exil'd thee; or suppose
	Devouring pestilence hangs in our air,
	And thou art flying to a fresher clime.
	Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
	To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou com'st.
	Suppose the singing birds musicians,
	The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,

	And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
	To counterfeit oppression of such grief
	That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
	Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
	And added years to his short banishment,
	He should have had a volume of farewells;
	But, since it would not, he had none of me.

<K_RICHARD>

	He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
	When time shall call him home from banishment,
	Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
	Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
	Observ'd his courtship to the common people,
	How he did seem to dive into their hearts
	With humble and familiar courtesy,
	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
	And patient underbearing of his fortune,
	As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
	Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well,
	And had the tribute of his supple knee,
	With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
	As were our England in reversion his,
	And he our subjects' next degree in hope.

	For our affairs in hand. If that come short,
	Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;

	O! but they say the tongues of dying men

	He that no more must say is listen'd more
	Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
	More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
	The setting sun, and music at the close,
	As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
	Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
	Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
	My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

	Report of fashions in proud Italy,
	Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
	Limps after in base imitation.
	Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity,--
	So it be new there's no respect how vile,--
	That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears?
	Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,

	Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
	Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
	This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
	This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,

	This fortress built by Nature for herself
	Against infection and the hand of war,
	This happy breed of men, this little world,
	This precious stone set in the silver sea,
	Which serves it in the office of a wall,
	Or as a moat defensive to a house,
	Against the envy of less happier lands,
	This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
	This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
	Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
	Renowned for their deeds as far from home,--
	For Christian service and true chivalry,--
	As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
	Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son:
	This land of such dear souls, this dear, dear land,
	Dear for her reputation through the world,
	Is now leas'd out,--I die pronouncing it,--
	Like to a tenement, or pelting farm:
	England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
	Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
	Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
	With inky blots, and rotten parchment bonds:
	That England, that was wont to conquer others,
	Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.

	Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.
	The pleasure that some fathers feed upon

	O! had thy grandsire, with a prophet's eye,

	Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,

	Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
	It were a shame to let this land by lease;

	Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,

	The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he:

	So much for that. Now for our Irish wars.
	We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
	Which live like venom where no venom else
	But only they have privilege to live.
	And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
	Towards our assistance we do seize to us

	How long shall I be patient? Ah! how long
	Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
	Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,
	Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
	Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
	About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
	Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
	Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
	I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
	Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first;
	In war was never lion rag'd more fierce,
	In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
	Than was that young and princely gentleman.
	His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
	Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
	But when he frown'd, it was against the French,
	And not against his friends; his noble hand
	Did win what he did spend, and spent not that
	Which his triumphant father's hand had won:
	His hands were guilty of no kindred's blood,
	But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
	O, Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
	Or else he never would compare between.

	O! my liege.
	Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas'd
	Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
	Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
	The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
	Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
	Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
	Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
	Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
	Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
	His charters and his customary rights;
	Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
	Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
	But by fair sequence and succession?
	Now, afore God,--God forbid I say true!--
	If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
	Call in the letters-patent that he hath
	By his attorneys-general to sue
	His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
	You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
	You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,
	And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
	Which honour and allegiance cannot think.

	If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
	Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
	Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
	Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt,

<BUSHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, your majesty is too much sad:

	To lay aside life-harming heaviness,
	And entertain a cheerful disposition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSHY>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To please the king I did; to please myself
	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
	As my sweet Richard: yet, again, methinks,
	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
	With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves
	More than with parting from my lord the king.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUEEN>
<BUSHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
	Which show like grief itself, but are not so.
	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
	Divides one thing entire to many objects;
	Like perspectives, which rightly gaz'd upon
	Show nothing but confusion; ey'd awry
	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
	Finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail;
	Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSHY>
<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It may be so; but yet my inward soul
	Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,

	As, though in thinking on no thought I think,
	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

</QUEEN>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power,

<QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
	And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:

	Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

	I will despair, and be at enmity

	Tut, tut!
	Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
	I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'
	In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
	Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
	Dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground?
	But then, more 'why?' why have they dar'd to march
	So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
	Frighting her pale-fac'd villages with war
	And ostentation of despised arms?
	Com'st thou because the anointed king is hence?
	Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
	And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
	Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
	As when brave Gaunt thy father, and myself,
	Rescu'd the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
	From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
	O! then, how quickly should this arm of mine,

<BOLINGBROKE>

	As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
	And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace
	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
	You are my father, for methinks in you
	I see old Gaunt alive: O! then, my father,
	Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
	A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
	Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
	If that my cousin king be King of England,
	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble kinsman;
	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
	I am denied to sue my livery here,
	And yet my letters-patent give me leave:
	My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
	And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
	What would you have me do? I am a subject,
	And challenge law: attorneys are denied me,
	And therefore personally I lay my claim
	To my inheritance of free descent.

	Bring forth these men.
	Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
	Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
	With too much urging your pernicious lives,
	For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
	From off my hands, here in the view of men
	I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
	You have misled a prince, a royal king,
	A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
	By you unhappied and disfigur'd clean:
	You have in manner with your sinful hours
	Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
	Broke the possession of a royal bed,
	And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
	With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
	Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
	Near to the king in blood, and near in love
	Till you did make him misinterpret me,
	Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
	And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
	Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
	Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
	Dispark'd my parks, and felled my forest woods,
	From mine own windows torn my household coat,
	Raz'd out my impress, leaving me no sign,
	Save men's opinions and my living blood,
	To show the world I am a gentleman.
	This and much more, much more than twice all this,
	Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
	To execution and the hand of death.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
	To stand upon my kingdom once again.
	Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
	Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
	As a long-parted mother with her child
	Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
	So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
	And do thee favour with my royal hands.
	Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
	Nor with thy sweets comfort his revenous sense;
	But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
	And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
	Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
	Which with usurping steps do trample thee.
	Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
	And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
	Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
	Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
	Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
	Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
	This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
	Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
	Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<CARLISLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear not, my lord: that power that made you king
	Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
	The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd,
	And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
	And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
	The proffer'd means of succour and redress.

</CARLISLE>
<AUMERLE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</AUMERLE>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
	Behind the globe, and lights the lower world,
	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen,
	In murders and in outrage bloody here;
	But when, from under this terrestrial ball
	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
	And darts his light through every guilty hole,
	Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
	The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
	So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
	Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
	Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
	Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
	His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
	Not able to endure the sight of day,
	But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
	Not all the water in the rough rude sea
	Can wash the balm from an anointed king;
	The breath of worldly men cannot depose
	The deputy elected by the Lord.
	For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
	God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
	A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
	Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.

	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.
	O! call back yesterday, bid time return,
	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men:
	To-day, to-day, unhappy day too late,
	O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;

	Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
	At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
	Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?

	Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd:
	The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
	Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care;
	And what loss is it to be rid of care?
	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
	Greater he shall not be: if he serve God
	We'll serve him too, and be his fellow so:
	Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
	They break their faith to God as well as us:
	Cry woe, destruction, ruin, loss, decay;
	The worst is death, and death will have his day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<SCROOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
	To bear the tidings of calamity.
	Like an unseasonable stormy day
	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
	As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears,
	So high above his limits swells the rage
	Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
	With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
	White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
	Against thy majesty; and boys, with women's voices,
	Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints
	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;
	Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
	Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
	Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
	Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
	And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCROOP>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
	Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
	What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
	That they have let the dangerous enemy
	Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
	If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.
	I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

	Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!

	Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
	Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
	Upon their spotted souls for this offence!

</K_RICHARD>
<SCROOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
	Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
	With heads and not with hands: those whom you curse
	Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
	And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.

<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter where. Of comfort no man speak:
	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
	Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth;
	Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
	And yet not so--for what can we bequeath
	Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
	Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,
	And nothing can we call our own but death,
	And that small model of the barren earth
	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
	For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
	And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
	How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,
	Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,
	Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd;
	All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
	That rounds the mortal temples of a king
	Keeps Death his court, and there the antick sits,
	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;
	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
	To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks,
	Infusing him with self and vain conceit
	As if this flesh which walls about our life
	Were brass impregnable; and humour'd thus
	Comes at the last, and with a little pin
	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
	Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
	With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
	Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
	For you have but mistook me all this while:
	I live with bread like you, feel want,
	Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
	How can you say to me I am a king?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<CARLISLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
	But presently prevent the ways to wail.
	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
	And so your follies fight against yourself.
	Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
	And fight and die is death destroying death;
	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

	Go to Flint Castle: there I'll pine away;

	Noble lord,
	Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle,
	Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
	Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
	Henry Bolingbroke
	On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
	And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
	To his most royal person; hither come
	Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
	Provided that my banishment repeal'd,
	And lands restor'd again be freely granted.
	If not, I'll use the advantage of my power,
	And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
	Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
	The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
	It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
	The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
	My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
	Go, signify as much, while here we march
	Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
	Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
	That from the castle's totter'd battlements
	Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
	Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
	With no less terror than the elements
	Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
	At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
	Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
	The rage be his, while on the earth I rain
	My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
	March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.

	To pay their awful duty to our presence?
	If we be not, show us the hand of God
	That hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship;
	For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
	Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
	Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
	And though you think that all, as you have done,
	Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
	And we are barren and bereft of friends;
	Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
	Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
	Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
	Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
	That lift your vassal hands against my head
	And threat the glory of my precious crown.
	Tell Bolingbroke,--for yond methinks he is,--
	That every stride he makes upon my land
	Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
	The purple testament of bleeding war;
	But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
	Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
	Shall ill become the flower of England's face,

	My sceptre for a palmer's walking-staff,
	My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
	And my large kingdom for a little grave,
	A little little grave, an obscure grave;
	Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
	Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
	May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
	For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
	And buried once, why not upon my head?
	Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
	We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
	Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
	And make a dearth in this revolting land.
	Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
	And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
	As thus; to drop them still upon one place,
	Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
	Within the earth; and, there inlaid: 'There lies
	Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.'
	Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
	I talk but idly and you laugh at me.

	With too much riches it confound itself:
	Had he done so to great and growing men,

	Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee

</BOLINGBROKE>
<CARLISLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, God forbid!
	Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
	Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
	Would God that any in this noble presence
	Were enough noble to be upright judge
	Of noble Richard! then, true noblesse would
	Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
	What subject can give sentence on his king?
	And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
	Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear,
	Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
	And shall the figure of God's majesty,
	His captain, steward, deputy elect,
	Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
	Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath,
	And he himself not present? O! forfend it, God,
	That in a Christian climate souls refin'd
	Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed.
	I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
	Stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king.
	My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
	Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king;
	And if you crown him, let me prophesy,
	The blood of English shall manure the ground
	And future ages groan for this foul act;
	Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
	And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
	Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
	Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
	Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
	The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
	O! if you rear this house against this house,
	It will the woefullest division prove
	That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
	Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
	Lest child, child's children, cry against you 'woe!'

	Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
	To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
	Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
	To this submission. Yet I well remember
	The favours of these men: were they not mine?
	Did they not sometime cry, 'All haill' to me?
	So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
	Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.
	God save the king! Will no man say, amen?
	Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.

<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;

	On this side my hand and on that side thine.
	Now is this golden crown like a deep well
	That owes two buckets filling one another;
	The emptier ever dancing in the air,

	That bucket down and full of tears am I,
	Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.

	Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
	My care is loss of care, by old care done;

	Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
	Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
	Now mark me how I will undo myself:
	I give this heavy weight from off my head,
	And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
	The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
	With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
	With mine own hands I give away my crown,
	With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
	With mine own breath release all duteous rites:
	All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
	My manors, rents, revenues, I forego;
	My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
	God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
	God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!
	Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev'd,
	And thou with all pleas'd, that hast all achiev'd!
	Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
	And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit!
	God save King Henry, unking'd Richard says,
	And send him many years of sunshine days!

<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must I do so? and must I ravel out

	If thy offences were upon record,
	Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
	To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
	There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
	Containing the deposing of a king,
	And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
	Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven.
	Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me,
	Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
	Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands,
	Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
	Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
	And water cannot wash away your sin.

	Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
	And yet salt water blinds them not so much
	But they can see a sort of traitors here.
	Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
	I find myself a traitor with the rest;
	For I have given here my soul's consent

	But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day!
	That I have worn so many winters out,
	And know not now what name to call myself.
	O! that I were a mockery king of snow,
	Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
	To melt myself away in water-drops.
	Good king, great king,--and yet not greatly good,
	An if my word be sterling yet in England,
	Let it command a mirror hither straight,

	Like to my followers in prosperity,

	Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face
	That like the sun did make beholders wink?
	Was this the face that fac'd so many follies,

	The shadow of my sorrow! Ha! let's see:
	'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;

	Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
	That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul;
	There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
	For thy great bounty, that not only giv'st
	Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way
	How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
	And then be gone and trouble you no more.
	Shall I obtain it?

	What! is my Richard both in shape and mind

	As from my death-bed, my last living leave.
	In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
	With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
	Of woeful ages, long ago betid;
	And ere thou bid good night, to quit their grief,
	Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,
	And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
	For why the senseless brands will sympathize
	The heavy accent of thy moving tongue,
	And in compassion weep the fire out;

	And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
	To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
	Being ne'er so little urg'd, another way

	Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
	And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
	Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
	Since, wedding it, thero is such length in grief.
	One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
	Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.

<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
	When weeping made you break the story off,
	Of our two cousins coming into London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUCHESS>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did I leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At that sad stop, my lord,
	Where rude misgovern'd hands, from windows' tops,
	Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUCHESS>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
	Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,
	Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
	With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
	While all tongues cried, 'God save thee, Bolingbroke!'
	You would have thought the very windows spake,
	So many greedy looks of young and old
	Through casements darted their desiring eyes
	Upon his visage, and that all the walls
	With painted imagery had said at once
	'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
	Whilst he, from one side to the other turning,
	Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed's neck,
	Bespake them thus, 'I thank you, countrymen:'
	And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<DUCHESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUCHESS>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
	After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage,
	Are idly bent on him that enters next,
	Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
	Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
	Did scowl on Richard: no man cried, 'God save him;'
	No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home;
	But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,
	Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
	His face still combating with tears and smiles,
	The badges of his grief and patience,
	That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
	The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,
	And barbarism itself have pitied him.
	But heaven hath a hand in these events,
	To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
	To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
	Whose state and honour I for aye allow.

	I have been studying how I may compare

	My brain I'll prove the female to my soul;
	My soul the father: and these two beget
	A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
	And these same thoughts people this little world
	In humours like the people of this world,
	For no thought is contented. The better sort,
	As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
	With scruples, and do set the word itself
	Against the word:
	As thus, 'Come, little ones;' and then again,
	'It is as hard to come as for a camel
	To thread the postern of a needle's eye.'
	Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
	Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
	May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
	Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
	And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
	Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
	That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
	Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
	Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
	That many have and others must sit there:
	And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
	Bearing their own misfortune on the back
	Of such as have before endur'd the like.
	Thus play I in one person many people,
	And none contented: sometimes am I king;
	Then treason makes me wish myself a beggar,
	And so I am: then crushing penury
	Persuades me I was better when a king;
	Then am I king'd again; and by and by
	Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
	And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
	Nor I nor any man that but man is
	With nothing shall be pleas'd, till he be eas'd
	With being nothing. Music do I hear
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Music.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
	When time is broke and no proportion kept!
	So is it in the music of men's lives.
	And here have I the daintiness of ear
	To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
	But for the concord of my state and time
	Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
	I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
	For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
	My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar
	Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
	Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
	Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
	Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
	Are clamorous groans, that strike upon my heart
	Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
	Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
	Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
	While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
	This music mads me: let it sound no more;
	For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
	In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
	Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
	For 'tis a sign of love, and love to Richard
	Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

Enter Groom of the Stable.
</DIRECTION>
<GROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hail, royal prince!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROOM>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, noble peer;
	The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
	What art thou? and how comest thou hither, man,
	Where no man never comes but that sad dog
	That brings me food to make misfortune live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<GROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
	When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
	With much ado at length have gotten leave
	To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
	O! how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
	In London streets, that coronation day
	When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
	That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
	That horse that I so carefully have dress'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROOM>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
	How went he under him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<GROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROOM>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
	That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
	This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
	Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down,--
	Since pride must have a fall,--and break the neck
	Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
	Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
	Since thou, created to be aw'd by man,
	Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
	And yet I bear a burden like an ass,
	Spur-gall'd and tir'd by jauncing Bolingbroke.

	Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.

<KEEPER>

	My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who lately came from the king, commands the contrary.

Enter Exton and Servants, armed.
</DIRECTION>
<K_RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now! what means death in this rude assault?
	Villain, thine own hand yields thy death's instrument
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Snatching a weapon and killing one.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go thou and fill another room in hell
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kills another: then Exton strikes him down.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
	That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
	Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
	Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high,
	Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Dies.
</DIRECTION>
<EXTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As full of valour as of royal blood:
	Both have I spilt; O! would the deed were good;
	For now the devil, that told me I did well,
	Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
	This dead king to the living king I'll bear.
	Take hence the rest and give them burial here.

<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear

Enter Northumberland.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, my lord. What is the news?
<NORTHUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
	The next news is: I have to London sent
	The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.
	The manner of their taking may appear
	At large discoursed in this paper here.

	We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains,

Enter Fitzwater.
</DIRECTION>
<FITZWATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
	The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
	Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
	That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.

</FITZWATER>
<BOLINGBROKE>

	Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;

<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,

	Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlisle, this is your doom:
	Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
	More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
	So, as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
	For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
	High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.

Enter Exton, with Attendants bearing a coffin
</DIRECTION>
<EXTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great king, within this coffin I present
	Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
	The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
	Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXTON>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
	A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
	Upon my head and all this famous land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOLINGBROKE>
<EXTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXTON>
<BOLINGBROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They love not poison that do poison need,
	Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
	I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
	The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
	But neither my good word nor princely favour:
	With Cain go wander through the shade of night,
	And never show thy head by day nor light.
	Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
	That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
	Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
	And put on sullen black incontinent.
	I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
	To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.
	March sadly after; grace my mournings here,
	In weeping after this untimely bier.
