<DIRECTION>
Scene.--For the first Act, in Venice; during the rest of the Play, at a Sea-Port in Cyprus.
</DIRECTION>
<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Venice. A Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Roderigo and Iago.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tush! Never tell me; I take it much unkindly
	That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
	As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
	If ever I did dream of such a matter,
	Abhor me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
	In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
	Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man.
	I know my price, I am worth no worse a place;
	But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
	Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
	Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
	And, in conclusion,
	Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
	'I have already chose my officer.'
	And what was he?
	Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
	One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
	A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
	That never set a squadron in the field,
	Nor the division of a battle knows
	More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
	Wherein the toged consuls can propose
	As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practice,
	Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;
	And I--of whom his eyes had seen the proof
	At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds
	Christian and heathen--must be be-lee'd and calm'd
	By debitor and creditor; this counter caster,
	He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
	And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, there's no remedy: 'tis the curse of the service,
	Preferment goes by letter and affection,
	Not by the old gradation, where each second
	Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
	Whe'r I in any just term am affin'd
	To love the Moor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not follow him then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! sir, content you;
	I follow him to serve my turn upon him;
	We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
	Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
	Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
	That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
	Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
	For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd;
	Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
	Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
	Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
	And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
	Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin'd their coats
	Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
	And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
	It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
	Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
	In following him, I follow but myself;
	Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
	But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
	For when my outward action doth demonstrate
	The native act and figure of my heart
	In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
	But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
	For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,
	If he can carry 't thus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call up her father;
	Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,
	Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,
	And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
	Plague him with flies; though that his joy be joy,
	Yet throw such changes of vexation on 't
	As it may lose some colour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do; with like timorous accent and dire yell
	As when, by night and negligence, the fire
	Is spied in populous cities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, ho! Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awake! what, ho! Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
	Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
	Thieves! thieves!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Brabantio, above, at a window.
</DIRECTION>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the reason of this terrible summons?
	What is the matter there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior, is all your family within?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are your doors lock'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? wherefore ask you this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Zounds! sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;
	Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
	Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
	Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!
	Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
	Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
	Arise, I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! have you lost your wits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not I, what are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Roderigo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The worser welcome:
	I have charg'd thee not to haunt about my doors:
	In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
	My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
	Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
	Upon malicious knavery dost thou come
	To start my quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, sir, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But thou must needs be sure
	My spirit and my place have in them power
	To make this bitter to thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, good sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
	My house is not a grange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most grave Brabantio,
	In simple and pure soul I come to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Zounds! sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What profane wretch art thou?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am one, sir, that comes to tell you, your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art a villain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are--a senator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
	If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent,--
	As partly, I find, it is,--that your fair daughter,
	At this odd-even and dull-watch o' the night,
	Transported with no worse nor better guard
	But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
	To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,--
	If this be known to you, and your allowance,
	We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
	But if you know not this, my manners tell me
	We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe,
	That, from the sense of all civility,
	I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
	Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
	I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
	Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
	In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
	Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
	If she be in her chamber or your house,
	Let loose on me the justice of the state
	For thus deluding you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike on the tinder, ho!
	Give me a taper! call up all my people!
	This accident is not unlike my dream;
	Belief of it oppresses me already.
	Light, I say! light!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit, from above.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, for I must leave you:
	It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
	To be produc'd, as, if I stay, I shall,
	Against the Moor; for, I do know the state,
	However this may gall him with some check,
	Cannot with safety cast him; for he's embark'd
	With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,--
	Which even now stand in act,--that, for their souls,
	Another of his fathom they have none,
	To lead their business; in which regard,
	Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,
	Yet, for necessity of present life,
	I must show out a flag and sign of love,
	Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
	Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
	And there will I be with him. So, farewell
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter below, Brabantio, and Servants with torches.
</DIRECTION>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is too true an evil: gone she is,
	And what's to come of my despised time
	Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
	Where didst thou see her? O, unhappy girl!
	With the Moor, sayst thou? Who would be a father!
	How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me
	Past thought. What said she to you? Get more tapers!
	Raise all my kindred! Are they married, think you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truly, I think they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O heaven! How got she out? O, treason of the blood:
	Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
	By what you see them act. Are there not charms
	By which the property of youth and maidhood
	May be abus'd? Have you not read, Roderigo,
	Of some such thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, I have indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call up my brother. O! that you had had her.
	Some one way, some another! Do you know
	Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can discover him, if you please
	To get good guard and go along with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
	I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
	And raise some special officers of night.
	On, good Roderigo; I'll deserve your pains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.

</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Another Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Othello, Iago, and Attendants, with torches.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
	Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
	To do no contriv'd murder: I lack iniquity
	Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times
	I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis better as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but he prated,
	And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
	Against your honour
	That, with the little godliness I have,
	I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray, sir,
	Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,
	That the magnifico is much belov'd,
	And hath in his effect a voice potential
	As double as the duke's; he will divorce you,
	Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
	The law--with all his might to enforce it on--
	Will give him cable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him do his spite:
	My services which I have done the signiory
	Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,
	Which when I know that boasting is an honour
	I shall promulgate, I fetch my life and being
	From men of royal siege, and my demerits
	May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
	As this that I have reach'd; for know, Iago,
	But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
	I would not my unhoused free condition
	Put into circumscription and confine
	For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are the raised father and his friends:
	You were best go in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not I; I must be found:
	My parts, my title, and my perfect soul
	Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Janus, I think no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Cassio and certain Officers, with torches.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
	The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
	What is the news?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The duke does greet you, general,
	And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
	Even on the instant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the matter, think you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.
	It is a business of some heat; the galleys
	Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
	This very night at one another's heels,
	And many of the consuls, rais'd and met,
	Are at the duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for;
	When, being not at your lodging to be found,
	The senate hath sent about three several quests
	To search you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis well I am found by you.
	I will but spend a word here in the house,
	And go with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ancient, what makes he here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carrack;
	If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's married.

Re-enter Othello.

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here comes another troop to seek for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is Brabantio. General, be advis'd;
	He comes to bad intent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Officers, with torches and weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holla! stand there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior, it is the Moor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down with him, thief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DIRECTION>
They draw on both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
	Good signior, you shall more command with years
	Than with your weapons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O thou foul thief! where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
	Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
	For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
	If she in chains of magic were not bound,
	Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
	So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
	The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
	Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
	Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
	Of such a thing as thou; to fear, not to delight.
	Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
	That thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms,
	Abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
	That weaken motion: I'll have 't disputed on;
	'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
	I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
	For an abuser of the world, a practiser
	Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
	Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
	Subdue him at his peril.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold your hands,
	Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
	Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
	Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
	To answer this your charge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To prison; till fit time
	Of law and course of direct session
	Call thee to answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I do obey?
	How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
	Whose messengers are here about my side,
	Upon some present business of the state
	To bring me to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis true, most worthy signior;
	The duke's in council, and your noble self,
	I am sure, is sent for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How! the duke in council!
	In this time of the night! Bring him away.
	Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
	Or any of my brothers of the state,
	Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
	For if such actions may have passage free,
	Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

	Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
	My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And mine, a hundred and forty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And mine, two hundred:
	But though they jump not on a just account,--
	As in these cases, where the aim reports,
	'Tis oft with difference,--yet do they all confirm
	A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<DUKE>

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How say you by this change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This cannot be,
	By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant
	To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
	The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
	And let ourselves again but understand,
	That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
	So may he with more facile question bear it,
	For that it stands not in such war-like brace,
	But altogether lacks the abilities
	That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
	We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
	To leave that latest which concerns him first,
	Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
	To wake and wage a danger profitless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

	Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

</SENATOR_1>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem
	Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
	Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,

	So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
	Neither my place nor aught I heard of business

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
	My very noble and approv'd good masters,
	That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
	It is most true; true, I have married her:
	The very head and front of my offending
	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
	And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace;
	For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
	Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us'd
	Their dearest action in the tented field;
	And little of this great world can I speak,
	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
	And therefore little shall I grace my cause
	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
	I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
	Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
	What conjuration, and what mighty magic,
	For such proceeding I am charg'd withal,
	I won his daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A maiden never bold;
	Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
	Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
	Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
	To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
	It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
	That will confess perfection so could err
	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
	To find out practices of cunning hell,
	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
	That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
	Or with some dram conjur'd to this effect,
	He wrought upon her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To vouch this, is no proof,
	Without more certain and more overt test
	Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
	Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Othello, speak:
	Did you by indirect and forced courses
	Subdue and poison this young maid's affections;

	As soul to soul affordeth?

</SENATOR_1>
<OTHELLO>

	I do beseech you,
	Send for the lady to the Sagittary,

	Not only take away, but let your sentence
	Even fall upon my life.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, till she come, as truly as to heaven

	So justly to your grave ears I'll present
	How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
	And she in mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say it, Othello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father lov'd me; oft invited me;
	Still question'd me the story of my life
	From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes
	That I have pass'd.
	I ran it through, even from my boyish days
	To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
	Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
	Of moving accidents by flood and field,
	Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
	Of being taken by the insolent foe
	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
	And portance in my travel's history;
	Wherein of antres vast and desarts idle,
	Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven,
	It was my hint to speak, such was the process;
	And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
	The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
	Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
	Would Desdemona seriously incline;
	But still the house-affairs would draw her thence;
	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
	She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
	Devour up my discourse. Which I observing,
	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
	Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
	But not intentively: I did consent;
	And often did beguile her of her tears,
	When I did speak of some distressful stroke
	That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
	She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
	'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
	She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
	That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
	And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her,
	I should but teach him how to tell my story,
	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
	She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd,
	And I lov'd her that she did pity them.
	This only is the witchcraft I have us'd:
	Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Desdemona, Iago, and Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Men do their broken weapons rather use
	Than their bare hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, hear her speak:
	If she confess that she was half the wooer,
	Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
	Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
	Do you perceive in all this noble company
	Where most you owe obedience?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My noble father,
	I do perceive here a divided duty:
	To you I am bound for life and education;
	My life and education both do learn me
	How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,
	I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband;
	And so much duty as my mother show'd
	To you, preferring you before her father,
	So much I challenge that I may profess
	Due to the Moor my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God be with you! I have done.
	Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs:
	I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
	Come hither, Moor:
	I here do give thee that with all my heart
	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
	I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
	I am glad at soul I have no other child;
	For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
	To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,
	Which as a grize or step, may help these lovers
	Into your favour.
	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
	Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
	What cannot be preserv'd when Fortune takes,
	Patience her injury a mockery makes.
	The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<BRABANTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
	We lose it not so long as we can smile.
	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
	But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
	These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
	But words are words; I never yet did hear
	That the bruis'd heart was pierced through the ear.
	I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRABANTIO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

	These present wars against the Ottomites.
	Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
	I crave fit disposition for my wife,
	Due reference of place and exhibition,
	With such accommodation and besort
	As levels with her breeding.

	And to his honours and his valiant parts
	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus, or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and woed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions; but we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.

</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It cannot be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>

	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow these wars; defeat thy favour with a usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,--put money in thy purse,--nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration; put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills;--fill thy purse with money:--the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.

	Thou art sure of me: go, make money. I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted: thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him; if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse; go: provide thy money. We will have more of this to-morrow. Adieu.

	The ship is here put in,
	A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
	Lieutenant to the war-like Moor Othello,
	Is come on shore: the Moor himself's at sea,
	And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN_3>
<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad on 't; 'tis a worthy governor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<GENTLEMAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
	Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly
	And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
	With foul and violent tempest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN_3>
<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray heaven he be;
	For I have serv'd him, and the man commands
	Like a full soldier. Let's to the sea-side, ho!
	As well to see the vessel that's come in
	As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
	Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
	An indistinct regard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<GENTLEMAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, let's do so;
	For every minute is expectancy
	Of more arrivance.

</GENTLEMAN_3>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Cassio.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, you the valiant of this war-like isle,
	That so approve the Moor. O! let the heavens
	Give him defence against the elements,
	For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he well shipp'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
	Of very expert and approv'd allowance;
	Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
	Stand in bold cure

<MESSENGER>

	The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
	Stand ranks of people, and they cry, 'A sail!'

</MESSENGER>
<CASSIO>

	My hopes do shape him for the governor.

<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most fortunately: he hath achiev'd a maid
	That paragons description and wild fame;
	One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
	And in th' essential vesture of creation
	Does tire the ingener.

<DIRECTION>
Re-enter second Gentleman.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now! who has put in?
<GENTLEMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN_2>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has had most favourable and happy speed:
	Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
	The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands,
	Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,
	As having sense of beauty, do omit
	Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
	The divine Desdemona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
	Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
	Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
	A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
	And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
	That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
	Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
	Give renew'd fire to our extinc'ed spirits,
	And bring all Cyprus comfort
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Desdemona, Emilia, Iago, Roderigo, and Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! behold,
	The riches of the ship is come on shore.
	Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
	Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
	Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
	Enwheel thee round!
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you, valiant Cassio.
	What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not yet arriv'd; nor know I aught
	But that he's well, and will be shortly here.

</CASSIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! but I fear--How lost you company?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The great contention of the sea and skies
	Parted our fellowship. But hark! a sail.

</CASSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Cry within, 'A sail!--a sail!' Guns heard.

<DIRECTION>
To Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	welcome, mistress.
	Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
	That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
	That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Kissing her.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
	As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
	You'd have enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! she has no speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In faith, too much;
	I find it still when I have list to sleep:
	Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
	She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
	And chides with thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have little cause to say so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
	Bells in your parlours, wild cats in your kitchens,
	Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,
	Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! fie upon thee, slanderer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
	You rise to play and go to bed to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall not write my praise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, let me not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O gentle lady, do not put me to 't,
	For I am nothing if not critical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on; assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not merry, but I do beguile
	The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
	Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am about it; but indeed my invention
	Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
	It plucks out brains and all: but my muse labours,
	And thus she is deliver'd.
	If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
	The one's for use, the other useth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well prais'd! How if she be black and witty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
	She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worse and worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How if fair and foolish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She never yet was foolish that was fair,
	For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's none so foul and foolish thereunto
	But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She that was ever fair and never proud,
	Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
	Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
	Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
	She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
	Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
	She that in wisdom never was so frail
	To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail,
	She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
	See suitors following and not look behind,
	She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He speaks home, madam; you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper; with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, 'tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! <span class="stage>[A trumpet heard.] The Moor! I know his trumpet.

	O my fair warrior!

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear Othello!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It gives me wonder great as my content
	To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
	If after every tempest come such calms,
	May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
	And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
	Olympus-high, and duck again as low
	As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
	'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear
	My soul hath her content so absolute
	That not another comfort like to this
	Succeeds in unknown fate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The heavens forbid
	But that our loves and comforts should increase
	Even as our days do grow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen to that, sweet powers!
	I cannot speak enough of this content;
	It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
	And this, and this, the greatest discords be
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kissing her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That e'er our hearts shall make!

</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! you are well tun'd now,
	But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
	As honest as I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, let us to the castle.
	News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.
	How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
	Honey, you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus;
	I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
	I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
	In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
	Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.
	Bring thou the master to the citadel;
	He is a good one, and his worthiness
	Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
	Once more well met at Cyprus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt all except Iago and Roderigo.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be'st valiant, as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them, list me. The lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee this, Desdemona is directly in love with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With him! why, 'tis not possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies; and will she love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it, and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted, as it is a most pregnant and unforced position, who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble, no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave! and the woman hath found him already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot believe that in her; she is full of most blessed condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blessed fig's end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes; if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor; blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst not mark that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lechery, by this hand! an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips, that their breaths embraced together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; for the command, I'll lay 't upon you: Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore.
	Farewell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adieu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
	That she loves him, 'tis apt, and of great credit:
	The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
	Is of a constant, loving, noble nature;
	And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
	A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
	Not out of absolute lust,--though peradventure
	I stand accountant for as great a sin,--
	But partly led to diet my revenge,
	For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
	Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
	Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards;
	And nothing can or shall content my soul
	Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife;
	Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
	At least into a jealousy so strong
	That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
	If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
	For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
	I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip;
	Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb,
	For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too,
	Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
	For making him egregiously an ass
	And practising upon his peace and quiet
	Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confus'd:
	Knavery's plain face is never seen till us'd.

	It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him; for, besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven.

	Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona, who let us not therefore blame; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.

</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a most exquisite lady.

	If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
	With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
	He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
	As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
	Whom love has turn'd almost the wrong side out,
	To Desdemona hath to-night carous'd
	Potations pottle deep; and he's to watch.
	Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
	That hold their honours in a wary distance,
	The very elements of this war-like isle,
	Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
	And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
	Am I to put our Cassio in some action
	That may offend the isle. But here they come.
	If consequence do but approve my dream,
	My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?

	Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
	For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl;
	He that stirs next to carve for his own rage

	Silence that dreadful bell! it frights the isle

	Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,

	Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
	The gravity and stillness of your youth
	The world hath noted, and your name is great

	That you unlace your reputation thus
	And spend your rich opinion for the name
	Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

</OTHELLO>
<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger;
	Your officer, Iago, can inform you,
	While I spare speech, which something now offends me,
	Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
	By me that's said or done amiss this night,
	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
	And to defend ourselves it be a sin
	When violence assails us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by heaven,
	My blood begins my safer guides to rule,
	And passion, having my best judgment collied,
	Assays to lead the way. If I once stir,
	Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
	Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
	How this foul rout began, who set it on;
	And he that is approv'd in this offence,
	Though he had twinn'd with me--both at a birth--
	Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
	Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
	To manage private and domestic quarrel,
	In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
	'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began 't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<MONTANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If partially affin'd, or leagu'd in office,
	Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
	Thou art no soldier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTANO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touch me not so near;
	I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
	Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
	Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
	Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
	Montano and myself being in speech,
	There comes a fellow crying out for he'p,
	And Cassio following with determin'd sword
	To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
	Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause;
	Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
	Lest by his clamour, as it so fell out,
	The town might fall in fright; he, swift of foot,
	Outran my purpose, and I return'd the rather
	For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
	And Cassio high in oath, which till to-night
	I ne'er might say before. When I came back,--
	For this was brief,--I found them close together,
	At blow and thrust, even as again they were
	When you yourself did part them.
	More of this matter can I not report:
	But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
	Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
	As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
	Yet, surely Cassio, I believe, receiv'd
	From him that fled some strange indignity,
	Which patience could not pass.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more offence in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What! man; there are ways to recover the general again; you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he is yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk! and speak parrot! and squabble, swagger, swear, and discourse fustian with one's own shadow! O thou invisible spirit of wine! if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!

	Why, but you are now well enough; how came you thus recovered?

</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen, but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>

	Come, come; good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used; exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

	I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general: I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune her; she'll help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You advise me well.
	</DIALOGUE>

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.

	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I must to the watch.

	And what's he then that says I play the villain?
	When this advice is free I give and honest,
	Probal to thinking and indeed the course
	To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
	The inclining Desdemona to subdue
	In any honest suit; she's fram'd as fruitful
	As the free elements. And then for her
	To win the Moor, were 't to renounce his baptism,
	All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
	His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
	That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
	Even as her appetite shall play the god
	With his weak function. How am I then a villain
	To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
	Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
	When devils will the blackest sins put on,
	They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
	As I do now; for while this honest fool
	Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,
	And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
	I'll pour this pestilence into his ear
	That she repeals him for her body's lust;
	And, by how much she strives to do him good,
	She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
	So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
	And out of her own goodness make the net
	That shall enmesh them all.

	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

	What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
	Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,

	Does 't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
	And thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassio.
	Though other things grow fair against the sun,
	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
	Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;

	Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech: wilt thou do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither,
	I shall seem to notify unto her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do, good my friend

	<DIALOGUE>
	In happy time, Iago.
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have not been a-bed, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, no; the day had broke
	Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
	To send in to your wife; my suit to her
	Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
	Procure me some access.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll send her to you presently;
	And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
	Out of the way, that your converse and business
	May be more free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I humbly thank you for 't

Exit Iago.

</CASSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow, good lieutenant: I am sorry
	For your displeasure; but all will soon be well.
	The general and his wife are talking of it,
	And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies
	That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
	And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
	He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you,
	And needs no other suitor but his likings
	To take the saf'st occasion by the front
	To bring you in again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet, I beseech you,
	If you think fit, or that it may be done,
	Give me advantage of some brief discourse
	With Desdemona alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, come in:
	I will bestow you where you shall have time
	To speak your bosom freely.

<CASSIO>

	I am much bound to you.

</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,
	And by him do my duties to the senate;
	That done, I will be walking on the works;
	Repair there to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my good lord, I'll do t.

</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see 't?

<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be thou assur'd, good Cassio, I will do
	All my abilities in thy behalf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
	As if the case were his.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
	But I will have my lord and you again
	As friendly as you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bounteous madam,
	Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
	He's never anything but your true servant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know 't; I thank you. You do love my lord;
	You have known him long; and be you well assur'd
	He shall in strangeness stand no further off
	Than in a politic distance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but, lady,
	That policy may either last so long,
	Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
	Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
	That, I being absent and my place supplied,
	My general will forget my love and service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
	I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
	If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
	To the last article; my lord shall never rest;
	I'll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;
	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
	I'll intermingle every thing he does
	With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio;
	For thy solicitor shall rather die
	Than give thy cause away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Othello, and Iago at a distance.

<EMILIA>

</EMILIA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, I'll take my leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, stay, and hear me speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, not now; I am very ill at ease,
	Unfit for mine own purposes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do your discretion.
	</DIALOGUE>

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! I like not that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What dost thou say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it
	That he would steal away so guilty-like,
	Seeing you coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do believe 'twas he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, my lord!
	I have been talking with a suitor here,
	A man that languishes in your displeasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is 't you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
	If I have any grace or power to move you,
	His present reconciliation take;
	For if he be not one that truly loves you,
	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
	I have no judgment in an honest face.
	I prithee call him back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Went he hence now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sooth; so humbled,
	That he hath left part of his grief with me,
	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But shall 't be shortly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sooner, sweet, for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall 't be to-night at supper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not to-night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow dinner then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall not dine at home;
	I meet the captains at the citadel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
	On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
	I prithee name the time, but let it not
	Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
	And yet his trespass, in our common reason,--
	Save that they say, the wars must make examples
	Out of their best,--is not almost a fault
	To incur a private check. When shall he come?
	Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
	What you could ask me that I should deny,
	Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
	That came a wooing with you, and so many a time,
	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
	Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
	To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, no more; let him come when he will;
	I will deny thee nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, this is not a boon;
	'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
	To your own person; nay, when I have a suit
	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
	And fearful to be granted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will deny thee nothing:
	Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
	To leave me but a little to myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
	Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<DIRECTION>
Exit, with Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul
	But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
	Chaos is come again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My noble lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What dost thou say, Iago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
	Know of your love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But for a satisfaction of my thought;
	No further harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why of thy thought, Iago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! yes; and went between us very oft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed! ay, indeed; discern'st thou aught in that?
	Is he not honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest! ay, honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, for aught I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What dost thou think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think, my lord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think, my lord!
	By heaven, he echoes me,
	As if there were some monster in his thought
	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
	I heard thee say but now, thou lik'dst not that,
	When Cassio left my wife; what didst not like?
	And when I told thee he was of my counsel
	In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, 'Indeed!'
	And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
	Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
	Show me thy thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, you know I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think thou dost;
	And, for I know thou art full of love and honesty,
	And weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath,
	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
	For such things in a false disloyal knave
	Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
	They are close delations, working from the heart
	That passion cannot rule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Michael Cassio,
	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men should be what they seem;
	Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certain, men should be what they seem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why then, I think Cassio 's an honest man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, yet there's more in this.
	I pray thee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
	As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
	The worst of words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good my lord, pardon me;
	Though I am bound to every act of duty,
	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
	As where's that palace whereinto foul things
	Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure
	But some uncleanly apprehensions
	Keep leets and law days, and in session sit
	With meditations lawful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
	If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his ear
	A stranger to thy thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do beseech you,
	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,--
	As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
	Shapes faults that are not,--that your wisdom yet,
	From one that so imperfectly conceits,
	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
	Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
	It were not for your quiet nor your good,
	Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
	To let you know my thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What dost thou mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
	Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
	Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
	'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
	But he that filches from me my good name
	Robs me of that which not enriches him,
	And makes me poor indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
	Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! beware, my lord, of jealousy;
	It is the green-ey'd monster which doth mock
	The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
	But, O! what damned minutes tells he o'er
	Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet soundly loves!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O misery!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,
	But riches fineless is as poor as winter
	To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
	Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
	From jealousy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, why is this?
	Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy,
	To follow still the changes of the moon
	With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
	Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat
	When I shall turn the business of my soul
	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
	Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
	To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
	Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
	The smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt;
	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
	I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
	And, on the proof, there is no more but this,
	Away at once with love or jealousy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
	To show the love and duty that I bear you
	With franker spirit; therefore, as I am bound,
	Receive it from me; I speak not yet of proof.
	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
	Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
	I would not have your free and noble nature
	Out of self-bounty be abus'd; look to 't:
	I know our country disposition well;
	In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
	They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
	Is not to leave 't undone, but keep 't unknown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou say so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did deceive her father, marrying you:
	And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
	She lov'd them most.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so she did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, go to, then;
	She that so young could give out such a seeming,
	To seel her father's eyes up close as oak,
	He thought 'twas witchcraft; but I am much to blame;
	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
	For too much loving you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am bound to thee for ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see, this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a jot, not a jot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' faith, I fear it has.
	I hope you will consider what is spoke
	Comes from my love. But, I do see you're mov'd;
	I am to pray you not to strain my speech
	To grosser issues nor to larger reach
	Than to suspicion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should you do so, my lord,
	My speech should fall into such vile success
	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
	My lord, I see you're mov'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not much mov'd:
	I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, yet, how nature erring from itself,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, there's the point: as, to be bold with you,
	Not to affect many proposed matches
	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
	Whereto, we see, in all things nature tends;
	Foh! one may smell in such, a will most rank,
	Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.
	But pardon me; I do not in position
	Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear
	Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
	May fail to match you with her country forms
	And happily repent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, farewell:
	If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
	Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, I take my leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Going.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did I marry? This honest creature, doubtless,
	Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Returning.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, I would I might entreat your honour
	To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.
	Although 'tis fit that Cassio have his place,
	For, sure he fills it up with great ability,
	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
	You shall by that perceive him and his means:
	Note if your lady strain his entertainment
	With any strong or vehement importunity;
	Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
	Let me be thought too busy in my fears,
	As worthy cause I have to fear I am,
	And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear not my government.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I once more take my leave.

<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
	And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
	Of human dealings; if I do prove her haggard,
	Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
	I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind,
	To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,
	And have not those soft parts of conversation
	That chamberers have, or, for I am declin'd
	Into the vale of years--yet that's not much--
	She's gone, I am abus'd; and my relief
	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage!
	That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
	And not their appetites. I had rather be a toad,
	And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
	Than keep a corner in the thing I love
	For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
	Prerogativ'd are they less than the base;
	'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
	Even then this forked plague is fated to us
	When we do quicken.
	Look! where she comes.
	If she be false, O! then heaven mocks itself.
	I'll not believe it.

<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, my dear Othello!
	Your dinner and the generous islanders
	By you invited, do attend your presence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am to blame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you speak so faintly?
	Are you not well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a pain upon my forehead here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
	Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
	It will be well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your napkin is too little
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She drops her handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am very sorry that you are not well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad I have found this napkin;
	This was her first remembrance from the Moor;
	My wayward husband hath a hundred times
	Woo'd me to steal it, but she so loves the token,
	For he conjur'd her she should ever keep it,
	That she reserves it evermore about her
	To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
	And give 't Iago:
	What he will do with it heaven knows, not I;
	I nothing but to please his fantasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Iago.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now! what do you here alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thing for me? It is a common thing--
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To have a foolish wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! is that all? What will you give me now
	For that same handkerchief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What handkerchief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What handkerchief!
	Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona:
	That which so often you did bid me steal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hast stol'n it from her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
	And, to the advantage, I, being there, took't up.
	Look, here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good wench; give it me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will you do with 't, that you have been so earnest
	To have me filch it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, what's that to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Snatches it.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it be not for some purpose of import
	Give 't me again; poor lady! she'll run mad
	When she shall lack it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
	Go, leave me
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
	And let him find it; trifles light as air
	Are to the jealous confirmations strong
	As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
	The Moor already changes with my poison:
	Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
	But with a little act upon the blood,
	Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so:
	Look! where he comes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Othello.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not poppy, nor mandragora,
	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
	Which thou ow'dst yesterday.
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! ha! false to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, how now, generall no more of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack;
	I swear 'tis better to be much abus'd
	Than but to know 't a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, my lord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
	I saw 't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me;
	I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
	I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips;
	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
	Let him not know 't and he's not robb'd at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sorry to hear this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had been happy, if the general camp,
	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
	So I had nothing known. O! now, for ever
	Farewell the tranquil mind; farewell content!
	Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
	That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
	Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
	The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
	The royal banner, and all quality,
	Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
	And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
	The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
	Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it possible, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof;
	Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,
	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
	Than answer my wak'd wrath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is 't come to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make me to see 't; or, at the least, so prove it,
	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
	To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My noble lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If thou dost slander her and torture me,
	Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
	On horror's head horrors accumulate;
	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz'd;
	For nothing canst thou to damnation add
	Greater than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O grace! O heaven forgive me!
	Are you a man! have you a soul or sense?
	God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool!
	That liv'st to make thine honesty a vice.
	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world!
	To be direct and honest is not safe.
	I thank you for this profit, and, from hence
	I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
	And loses that it works for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the world,
	I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
	I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
	I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
	As Dian's visage, is now begrim'd and black
	As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,
	Poison or fire or suffocating streams,
	I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.
	I do repent me that I put it to you.
	You would be satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would! nay, I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And may; but how? how satisfied, my lord?
	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on;
	Behold her tupp'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Death and damnation! O!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
	To bring them to that prospect; damn them then,
	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
	More than their own! What then? how then?
	What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
	It is impossible you should see this,
	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
	As ignorance made drunk; but yet, I say,
	If imputation, and strong circumstances,
	Which lead directly to the door of truth,
	Will give you satisfaction, you may have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not like the office;
	But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
	Prick'd to 't by foolish honesty and love,
	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
	And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
	I could not sleep.
	There are a kind of men so loose of soul
	That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;
	One of this kind is Cassio.
	In sleep I heard him say, 'Sweet Desdemona,
	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves!'
	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
	Cry, 'O, sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
	As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,
	That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
	Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
	Cried, 'Cursed fate, that gave thee to the Moor!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O monstrous! monstrous!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, this was but his dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
	'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this may help to thicken other proofs
	That do demonstrate thinly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tear her all to pieces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:
	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
	Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
	I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
	See Cassio wipe his beard with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it be that,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it be that, or any that was hers,
	It speaks against her with the other proofs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! that the slave had forty thousand lives;
	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
	Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven:
	'Tis gone.
	Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!
	Yield up, O love! thy crown and hearted throne
	To tyrannous hate. Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
	For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet be content.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! blood, blood, blood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, I say; your mind, perhaps, may change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, Iago. Like to the Pontick sea,
	Whose icy current and compulsive course
	Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
	To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
	Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
	Till that a capable and wide revenge
	Swallow them up
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kneels.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by yond marble heaven,
	In the due reverence of a sacred vow
	I here engage my words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not rise yet
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kneels.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Witness, you ever-burning lights above!
	You elements that clip us round about!
	Witness, that here Iago doth give up
	The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
	To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
	And to obey shall be in me remorse,
	What bloody business ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I greet thy love,
	Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
	And will upon the instant put thee to 't:
	Within these three days let me hear thee say
	That Cassio's not alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
	But let her live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
	Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw
	To furnish me with some swift means of death
	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am your own for ever.

<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dare not say he lies any where.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to; where lodges he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can anything be made of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions, and by them answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seek him, bid him come hither; tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf, and hope all will be well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CLOWN>

	To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.

	I know not, madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
	Full of cruzadoes; and, but my noble Moor
	Is true of mind, and made of no such baseness
	As jealous creatures are, it were enough
	To put him to ill thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he not jealous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who! he? I think the sun where he was born
	Drew all such humours from him.

</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! where he comes.

<DIRECTION>
Enter Othello.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is 't with you, my lord?
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my good lady
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! hardness to dissemble.
	How do you, Desdemona?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my good lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
	Hot, hot, and moist; this hand of yours requires
	A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
	Much castigation, exercise devout;
	For here's a young and sweating devil here,
	That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
	A frank one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may, indeed, say so;
	For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A liberal hand; the hearts of old gave hands,
	But our new heraldry is hands not hearts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What promise, chuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.
	Lend me thy handkerchief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That which I gave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have it not about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, indeed, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is a fault.
	That handkerchief
	Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
	She was a charmer, and could almost read
	The thoughts of people; she told her, while she kept it,
	'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
	Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
	Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
	Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt
	After new fancies. She dying gave it me;
	And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
	To give it her. I did so: and take heed on 't;
	Make it a darling like your precious eye;
	To lose't or give't away, were such perdition
	As nothing else could match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is 't possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it;
	A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
	The sun to course two hundred compasses,
	In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
	The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,
	And it was dy'd in mummy which the skilful
	Conserv'd of maidens' hearts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed! is 't true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most veritable; therefore look to 't well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then would to heaven that I had never seen it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! wherefore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is 't lost? is 't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say you?

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not lost: but what an if it were?

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say, it is not lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fetch 't, let me see 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
	This is a trick to put me from my suit:
	Pray you let Cassio be receiv'd again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fetch me the handkerchief; my mind misgives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come;
	You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The handkerchief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray, talk me of Cassio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The handkerchief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man that all his time
	Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
	Shar'd dangers with you,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The handkerchief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In sooth you are to blame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is not this man jealous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ne'er saw this before.
	Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief;
	I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis not a year or two shows us a man;
	They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
	They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
	They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Iago and Cassio.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no other way; 'tis she must do 't:
	And, lo! the happiness: go and importune her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
	That by your virtuous means I may again
	Exist, and be a member of his love
	Whom I with all the office of my heart
	Entirely honour; I would not be delay'd.
	If my offence be of such mortal kind
	That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
	Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,
	Can ransom me into his love again,
	But to know so must be my benefit;
	So shall I clothe me in a forc'd content,
	And shut myself up in some other course
	To fortune's alms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! thrice-gentle Cassio!
	My advocation is not now in tune;
	My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
	Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
	So help me every spirit sanctified,
	As I have spoken for you all my best
	And stood within the blank of his displeasure
	For my free speech. You must awhile be patient;
	What I can do I will, and more I will
	Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is my lord angry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He went hence but now,
	And, certainly in strange unquietness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
	When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
	And, like the devil, from his very arm
	Puff'd his own brother; and can he be angry?
	Something of moment then; I will go meet him;
	There's matter in 't indeed, if he be angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prithee, do so
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Iago.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something, sure, of state,
	Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practice
	Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
	Hath puddled his clear spirit; and, in such cases
	Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
	Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
	For let our finger ache, and it indues
	Our other healthful members ev'n to that sense
	Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,
	Nor of them look for such observancy
	As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
	I was--unhandsome warrior as I am--
	Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
	But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
	And he's indicted falsely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
	And no conception, nor no jealous toy
	Concerning you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
	They are not ever jealous for the cause,
	But jealous for they are jealous; 'tis a monster
	Begot upon itself, born on itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout;
	If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
	And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I humbly thank your ladyship
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.

</CASSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Bianca.
</DIRECTION>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save you, friend Cassio!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What make you from home?
	How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
	I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
	What! keep a week away? seven days and nights?
	Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
	More tedious than the dial eight score times?
	O weary reckoning!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, Bianca,
	I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd,
	But I shall, in a more continuate time,
	Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Giving her Desdemona's handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me this work out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Cassio! whence came this?
	This is some token from a newer friend;
	To the felt absence now I feel a cause;
	Is 't come to this? Well, well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to, woman!
	Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
	From whence you have them. You are jealous now
	That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
	No, in good troth, Bianca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, whose is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not, sweet; I found it in my chamber.
	I like the work well; ere it be demanded,--
	As like enough it will,--I'd have it copied;
	Take it and do 't; and leave me for this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave you! wherefore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do attend here on the general,
	And think it no addition nor my wish
	To have him see me woman'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, I pray you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I love you not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that you do not love me.
	I pray you, bring me on the way a little
	And say if I shall see you soon at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
	For I attend here; but I'll see you soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis very good; I must be circumstanc'd

<ACT_4>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Cyprus. Before the Castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Othello and Iago.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think so, Iago!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What!
	To kiss in private?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An unauthoriz'd kiss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or to be naked with her friend a-bed
	An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naked a-bed, Iago, and not mean harm?
	It is hypocrisy against the devil:
	They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
	The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip;
	But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
	She may, I think, bestow 't on any man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is protectress of her honour too;
	May she give that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
	They have it very oft that have it not:
	But for the handkerchief,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it:--
	Thou said'st,--O! it comes o'er my memory,
	As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
	Boding to all,--he had my handkerchief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, what of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not so good now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What,
	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
	Or heard him say, as knaves be such abroad,
	Who having, by their own importunate suit,
	Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
	Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
	But they must blab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath he said any thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath, my lord; but be you well assur'd,
	No more than he'll unswear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What hath he said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie--
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With her, on her; what you will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie with her! lie on her! We say, lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome. Handkerchief,--confessions,--handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess: I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is it possible?--Confess!--Handkerchief!--O devil!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Falls in a trance.
</DIRECTION>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work on,
	My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
	And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
	All guitless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
	My lord, I say! Othello!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Cassio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, Cassio!
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord is fallen into an epilepsy;
	This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rub him about the temples.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, forbear;
	The lethargy must have his quiet course,
	If not he foams at mouth, and by and by
	Breaks out to savage madness. Look! he stirs;
	Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
	He will recover straight; when he is gone,
	I would on great occasion speak with you
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Cassio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou mock me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mock you! no, by heaven.
	Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A horned man's a monster and a beast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's many a beast then, in a populous city,
	And many a civil monster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he confess it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good sir, be a man;
	Think every bearded fellow that's but yok'd
	May draw with you; there's millions now alive
	That nightly lie in those unproper beds
	Which they dare swear peculiar; your case is better.
	O! 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
	To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
	And to suppose her chaste. No, let me know;
	And knowing what I am I know what she shall be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! thou art wise; 'tis certain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand you awhile apart;
	Confine yourself but in a patient list.
	Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief,--
	A passion most unsuiting such a man,--
	Cassio came hither; I shifted him away,
	And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;
	Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
	The which he promis'd. Do but encave yourself,
	And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
	That dwell in every region of his face;
	For I will make him tell the tale anew,
	Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
	He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
	I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
	Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
	And nothing of a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou hear, Iago?
	I will be found most cunning in my patience;
	But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not amiss;
	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Othello goes apart.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
	A housewife that by selling her desires
	Buys herself bread and clothes; it is a creature
	That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
	To beguile many and be beguil'd by one.
	He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
	From the excess of laughter. Here he comes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Cassio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
	And his unbookish jealousy must construe
	Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behaviour
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
	Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The worser that you give me the addition
	Whose want even kills me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on 't
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Speaking lower.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power,
	How quickly should you speed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! poor caitiff!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! how he laughs already!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never knew woman love man so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! poor rogue, I think, i' faith, she loves me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear, Cassio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he importunes him
	To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She gives it out that you shall marry her;
	Do you intend it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha, ha, ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I marry her! what? a customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, say true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a very villain else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you scored me? Well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the monkey's own giving out: she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and thither come this bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck;--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crying, 'O dear Cassio!' as it were; his gesture imports it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me; ha, ha, ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O! I see that nose of yours, but not the dog I shall throw it to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I must leave her company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before me! look, where she comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Bianca.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean by this haunting of me?
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work! A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work! There, give it your hobby-horse; wheresoever you had it I'll take out no work on 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, my sweet Bianca! how now, how now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

	Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you sup there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I intend so.

</CASSIO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.

	How shall I murder him, Iago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! Iago!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did you see the handkerchief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that mine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yours, by this hand; and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have him nine years a-killing.
	A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, you must forget that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O! the world hath not a sweeter creature; she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks.

</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that's not your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle! An admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!

</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's the worse for all this.

</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a condition!

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, too gentle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that's certain;--but yet the pity of it, Iago! O! Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

</OTHELLO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.

<OTHELLO>

	Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.

	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.

	Good, good; the justice of it pleases; very good.

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am very glad to see you, signior;
	Welcome to Cyprus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

</LODOVICO>
<IAGO>

	Lives, sir.

<DESDEMONA>

	Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord

	He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
	Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A most unhappy one; I would do much
	To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What! is he angry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May be the letter mov'd him;
	For, as I think, they do command him home,
	Deputing Cassio in his government.

</LODOVICO>

	Trust me, I am glad on 't.

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Strikes her.

	My lord, this would not be believ'd in Venice,
	Though I should swear I saw 't: 'tis very much;
	Make her amends, she weeps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O devil, devil!
	If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
	Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
	Out of my sight!

	What would you with her, sir?

</OTHELLO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, I, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
	Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
	And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
	And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
	Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
	Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
	I am commanded home. Get you away;
	I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
	And will return to Venice. Hence! avaunt
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Desdemona.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, to-night,
	I do entreat that we may sup together;
	You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
	Call all-in-all sufficient? is this the noble nature
	Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
	The shot of accident nor dart of chance
	Could neither graze nor pierce?

</LODOVICO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is much chang'd.

<LODOVICO>

	Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

</LODOVICO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's that he is; I may not breathe my censure.
	What he might be, if, what he might, he is not,
	I would to heaven he were!

</IAGO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! strike his wife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
	That stroke would prove the worst!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it his use?
	Or did the letters work upon his blood,
	And new-create this fault?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas, alas!
	It is not honesty in me to speak
	What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
	And his own courses will denote him so
	That I may save my speech. Do but go after
	And mark how he continues.

<DIRECTION>
Enter Othello and Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have seen nothing, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you have seen Cassio and her together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
	Each syllable that breath made up between them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! did they never whisper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor send you out o' the way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
	Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
	Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
	If any wretch have put this in your head,
	Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
	For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
	There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
	Is foul as slander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bid her come hither; go
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
	That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
	A closet lock and key of villanous secrets;
	And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Emilia with Desdemona.
</DIRECTION>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, what is your will?

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray, chuck, come hither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your pleasure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see your eyes;
	Look in my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What horrible fancy's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
To Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of your function, mistress;
	Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
	Cough or cry 'hem' if any body come;
	Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Emilia.
</DIRECTION>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
	I understand a fury in your words,
	But not the words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, what art thou?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife, my lord; your true
	And loyal wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, swear it, damn thyself;
	Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
	Should fear to seize thee; therefore be double-damn'd;
	Swear thou art honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven doth truly know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Desdemona; away, away, away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas, the heavy day!--Why do you weep?
	Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
	If haply you my father do suspect
	An instrument of this your calling back,
	Lay not your blame on me; if you have lost him,
	Why, I have lost him too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had it pleas'd heaven
	To try me with affliction, had he rain'd
	All kinds of sores, and shames, on my bare head,
	Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
	Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
	I should have found in some part of my soul
	A drop of patience; but, alas! to make me
	The fixed figure for the time of scorn
	To point his slow and moving finger at;
	Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
	But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
	Where either I must live or bear no life,
	The fountain from the which my current runs
	Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
	Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
	To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
	Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin;
	Ay, there, look grim as hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
	That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed!
	Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
	That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! what ignorant sin have I committed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
	Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
	Committed! O thou public commoner!
	I should make very forges of my cheeks,
	That would to cinders burn up modesty,
	Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
	Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
	The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
	Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
	And will not hear it. What committed!
	Impudent strumpet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heaven, you do me wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are not you a strumpet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, as I am a Christian.
	If to preserve this vessel for my lord
	From any other foul unlawful touch
	Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! not a whore?

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>

	No, as I shall be sav'd.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cry you mercy, then;

	That married with Othello. You, mistress,

<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Emilia.

</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have none; do not talk to me, Emilia;

	Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember:
	And call thy husband hither.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your pleasure, madam? How is it with you?

</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
	Do it with gentle means and easy tasks;
	He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
	I am a child to chiding.

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! Iago, my lord hath so bewhor'd her,
	Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
	As true hearts cannot bear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I that name, Iago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What name, fair lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such as she says my lord did say I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>

</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has she forsook so many noble matches,
	Her father and her country and her friends,
	To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is my wretched fortune.

	Nay, heaven doth know.

<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,

	Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
	What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
	The Moor's abus'd by some most villanous knave,
	Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
	O heaven! that such companions thou'dst unfold,
	And put in every honest hand a whip
	To lash the rascals naked through the world,
	Even from the east to the west!
	</DIALOGUE>

<IAGO>

	Speak within door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! fie upon them. Some such squire he was
	That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
	And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

</EMILIA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a fool; go to.

</IAGO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O good Iago,
	What shall I do to win my lord again?
	Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
	I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
	If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
	Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
	Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
	Delighted them in any other form;
	Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
	And ever will, though he do shake me off
	To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,
	Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
	And his unkindness may defeat my life,
	But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
	It does abhor me now I speak the word;
	To do the act that might the addition earn
	Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you be content, 'tis but his humour;
	The business of the state does him offence,
	And he does chide with you.

	<DIALOGUE>

<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in the contrary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency, than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you hear me, Roderigo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You charge me most unjustly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist; you have told me she has received them, and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well; go to; very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well: by this hand, I say, it is very scurvy, and begin to find myself fobbed in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona; if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have said now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and said nothing, but what I protest intendment of doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo; thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hath not appeared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, no! he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you mean, removing of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out his brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that you would have me do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him; he knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence,--which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,--you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste; about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IAGO>
<RODERIGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will hear further reason for this.

	And bade me to dismiss you.

</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dismiss me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
	Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
	We must not now displease him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would you had never seen him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So would not I; my love doth so approve him,
	That even his stubbornness, his checks and frowns,--
	Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

</EMILIA>

</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother had a maid call'd Barbara;
	She was in love, and he she lov'd prov'd mad
	And did forsake her; she had a song of 'willow;'
	An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
	And she died singing it; that song to-night
	Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
	But to go hang my head all at one side,
	And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

	The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
	Sing all a green willow;
	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;--
	Lay by these:--
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon.--
	Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
	Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve,--
	Nay, that's not next. Hark! who is it that knocks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the wind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
	Sing willow, willow, willow:
	If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men.
	So, get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;
	Doth that bode weeping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis neither here nor there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have heard it said so. O! these men, these men!
	Dost thou in conscience think, tell me, Emilia,
	That there be women do abuse their husbands
	In such gross kind?

</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There be some such, no question.

</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, by this heavenly light!

</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor I neither by this heavenly light; might do 't as well i' the dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world is a huge thing; 'tis a great price
	For a small vice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In troth, I think I should, and undo 't when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but for the whole world, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
	For the whole world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILIA>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not think there is any such woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage, as would store the world they played for.
	But I do think it is their husbands' faults
	If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,
	And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
	Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
	Throwing restraint upon us; or, say they strike us,
	Or scant our former having in despite;
	Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
	Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
	Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell,
	And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
	As husbands have. What is it that they do
	When they change us for others? Is it sport?
	I think it is; and doth affection breed it?
	I think it doth: is 't frailty that thus errs?
	It is so too; and have not we affections,
	Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
	Then, let them use us well; else let them know,
	The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
	</DIALOGUE>

</RODERIGO>
<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
	And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
	Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
	Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
	He calls me to a restitution large
	Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
	As gifts to Desdemona;
	It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
	He hath a daily beauty in his life
	That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
	May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
	No, he must die. But so; I hear him coming.

	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
	To be a party in this injury.
	Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come.
	Lend me a light. Know we this face, or no?
	Alas! my friend and my dear countryman,
	Roderigo? no: yes, sure, O heaven! Roderigo.

A chair brought in.

<DIRECTION>
To Bianca.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you, mistress,
	Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,

<CASSIO>

Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?--
	Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
	Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
	Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:

<IAGO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! good gentleman; alas! good Cassio!

	This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,

	What! do you shake at that?

</IAGO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

	Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

	Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.

	Will you go on afore

Enter Othello.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul;
	Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
	It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,
	Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
	And smooth as monumental alabaster.
	Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
	Put out the light, and then put out the light:
	If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
	I can again thy former light restore,
	Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
	Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
	I know not where is that Promethean heat
	That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
	I cannot give it vital growth again,
	It needs must wither: I'll smell it on the tree
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
	Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
	Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
	And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
	So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
	But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly,
	It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there? Othello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, Desdemona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you come to bed, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you bethink yourself of any crime
	Unreconcil'd as yet to heaven and grace,
	Solicit for it straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! my lord, what may you mean by that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
	I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
	No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk you of killing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then heaven
	Have mercy on me!

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen! with all my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hum!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
	When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,
	Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think on thy sins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are loves I bear to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and for that thou diest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
	Alas! why gnaw you so your nether lip?
	Some bloody passion shakes your very frame;
	These are portents, but yet, I hope, I hope
	They do not point on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace, and be still!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will so. What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That handkerchief which I so lov'd and gave thee
	Thou gav'st to Cassio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, by my life and soul!
	Send for the man and ask him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet soul, take heed,
	Take heed of perjury; thou'rt on thy death-bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but not yet to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, presently;
	Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
	For to deny each article with oath
	Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
	That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then Lord have mercy on me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say, amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And have you mercy too! I never did
	Offend you in my life; never lov'd Cassio
	But with such general warranty of heaven
	As I might love; I never gave him token.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
	O perjur'd woman! thou dost stone my heart,
	And mak'st me call what I intend to do
	A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
	I saw the handkerchief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He found it then;
	I never gave it him. Send for him hither;
	Let him confess a truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath confess'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That he hath us'd thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How? unlawfully?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will not say so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; his mouth is stopp'd:
	Honest Iago hath ta'en order for 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! my fear interprets. What! is he dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

</DESDEMONA>
<OTHELLO>

	Down, strumpet!

</OTHELLO>
<DESDEMONA>

	Nay, if you strive,--

</OTHELLO>

<OTHELLO>

	Yes; 'tis Emilia: by and by. She's dead.
	'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death;
	The noise was high. Ha! no more moving?
	Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were 't good?
	I think she stirs again: no. What's best to do?
	If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife:
	My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife:
	O, insupportable! O heavy hour!
	Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
	Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe

<EMILIA>

	No, Cassio is not kill'd.

</EMILIA>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! she was foul.
	I scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,

	I know this act shows terrible and grim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<GRATIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead.
	Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
	Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
	This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
	Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
	And fall to reprobation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRATIANO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
	That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
	A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
	And she did gratify his amorous works
	With that recognizance and pledge of love
	Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand:
	It was a handkerchief, an antique token
	My father gave my mother.

<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
	I found by fortune and did give my husband;

	More than, indeed, belong'd to such a trifle,
	He begg'd of me to steal it.

Exeunt Montano and Gratiano.

</OTHELLO>
<EMILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did thy song bode, lady?
	Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,
	And die in music:--
	Willow, willow, willow.
	Moor, she was chaste; she lov'd thee, cruel Moor;
	So come my soul to bliss as I speak true;

<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behold! I have a weapon;
	A better never did itself sustain
	Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
	That with this little arm, and this good sword,
	I have made my way through more impediments
	Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
	Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
	Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
	Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
	And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
	Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
	Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
	And he retires. Where should Othello go?
	Now how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
	Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
	This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
	And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
	Even like thy chastity.
	O! cursed, cursed slave. Whip me, ye devils,
	From the possession of this heavenly sight!
	Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
	Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
	O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
	Oh! Oh! Oh!

	O thou Othello! that wert once so good,

</LODOVICO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, any thing:
	An honourable murderer, if you will;
	For nought did I in hate, but all in honour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:

<OTHELLO>

	I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
	Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
	Why he hath thus ensnar'd my soul and body?

<IAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
	From this time forth I never will speak word.

	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
	Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
	Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
	And here another; the one of them imports
	The death of Cassio to be undertook
	By Roderigo.
	</DIALOGUE>

<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O villain!

</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most heathenish and most gross!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now here's another discontented paper,
	Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
	Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,
	But that, belike, Iago in the interim
	Came in and satisfied him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O the pernicious caitiff!
	How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
	That was my wife's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found it in my chamber;
	And he himself confess'd but even now
	That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
	Which wrought to his desire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O fool! fool! fool!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHELLO>
<CASSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is besides in Roderigo's letter
	How he upbraids Iago that he made him
	Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
	That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
	After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
	Iago set him on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIO>
<LODOVICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must forsake this room and go with us;
	Your power and your command is taken off,
	And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
	If there be any cunning cruelty
	That can torment him much and hold him long,
	It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest.
	Till that the nature of your fault be known
	To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LODOVICO>
<OTHELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft you; a word or two before you go.
	I have done the state some service, and they know't;
	No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
	When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
	Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
	Nor set down aught in malice: then, must you speak
	Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well;
	Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,
	Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
	Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
	Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu'd eyes
	Albeit unused to the melting mood,
	Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
	Their med'cinable gum. Set you down this;
	And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
	Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
	Beat a Venetian and traduc'd the state,
	I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
	And smote him thus.

	<DIALOGUE>
	O Spartan dog!
	More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea.
	Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
	This is thy work; the object poisons sight;
	Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
	And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
	For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
	Remains the censure of this hellish villain,
	The time, the place, the torture; O! enforce it.
	Myself will straight aboard, and to the state
	This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
