	Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
	And by the doom of death end woes and all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AEGEON>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.
	I am not partial to infringe our laws:
	The enmity and discord which of late
	Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
	To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
	Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
	Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
	Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
	For, since the mortal and intestine jars
	'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
	It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
	Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
	T' admit no traffic to our adverse towns:
	Nay, more, if any, born at Ephesus
	Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;
	Again, if any Syracusian born
	Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
	His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose;
	Unless a thousand marks be levied,
	To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
	Thy substance, valu'd at the highest rate,
	Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
	Therefore, by law thou art condemn'd to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<AEGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
	My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AEGEON>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Syracusian; say, in brief the cause
	Why thou departedst from thy native home,
	And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<AEGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A heavier task could not have been impos'd
	Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
	Yet, that the world may witness that my end
	Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
	I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
	In Syracusa was I born, and wed
	Unto a woman, happy but for me,
	And by me too, had not our hap been bad.
	With her I liv'd in joy: our wealth increas'd
	By prosperous voyages I often made
	To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
	And the great care of goods at random left,
	Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
	From whom my absence was not six months old,
	Before herself,--almost at fainting under
	The pleasing punishment that women bear,--
	Had made provision for her following me,
	And soon and safe arrived where I was.
	There had she not been long but she became
	A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
	And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
	As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
	That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
	A meaner woman was delivered
	Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
	Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
	I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
	My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
	Made daily motions for our home return:
	Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon
	We came aboard.
	A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
	Before the always-wind-obeying deep
	Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
	But longer did we not retain much hope;
	For what obscured light the heavens did grant
	Did but convey unto our fearful minds
	A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
	Which, though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
	Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
	Weeping before for what she saw must come,
	And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
	That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
	Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
	And this it was, for other means was none:
	The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
	And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
	My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
	Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
	Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
	To him one of the other twins was bound,
	Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
	The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
	Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
	Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
	And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
	Were carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
	At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
	Dispers'd those vapours that offended us,
	And, by the benefit of his wished light
	The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
	Two ships from far making amain to us;
	Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
	But ere they came,--O! let me say no more;
	Gather the sequel by that went before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AEGEON>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
	For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<AEGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! had the gods done so, I had not now
	Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
	For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
	We were encounter'd by a mighty rock;
	Which being violently borne upon,
	Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
	So that, in this unjust divorce of us
	Fortune had left to both of us alike
	What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
	Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
	With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
	Was carried with more speed before the wind,
	And in our sight they three were taken up
	By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
	At length, another ship had seiz'd on us;
	And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
	Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack'd guests;
	And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
	Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
	And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
	Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
	That by misfortune was my life prolong'd,
	To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AEGEON>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
	Do me the favour to dilate at full
	What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<AEGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
	At eighteen years became inquisitive
	After his brother; and importun'd me
	That his attendant--for his case was like,
	Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
	Might bear him company in the quest of him;
	Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
	I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
	Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
	Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
	And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,
	Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
	Or that or any place that harbours men.
	But here must end the story of my life;
	And happy were I in my timely death,
	Could all my travels warrant me they live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AEGEON>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hapless Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
	To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
	Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
	Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
	Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
	My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
	But though thou art adjudged to the death
	And passed sentence may not be recall'd
	But to our honour's great disparagement,
	Yet will I favour thee in what I can:
	Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
	To seek thy life by beneficial help.
	Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
	Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
	And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
	Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GAOLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, my lord.

</GAOLER>
<AEGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
	But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

The Mart.

<DIRECTION>
Enter Antipholus of Syracuse, Dromio of Syracuse, and a Merchant.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
	Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
	This very day, a Syracusian merchant
	Is apprehended for arrival here;
	And, not being able to buy out his life,
	According to the statute of the town
	Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
	There is your money that I had to keep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
	And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
	Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
	Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
	Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
	And then return and sleep within mine inn,
	For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
	Get thee away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Many a man would take you at your word,
	And go indeed, having so good a mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
	When I am dull with care and melancholy,
	Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
	What, will you walk with me about the town,
	And then go to my inn and dine with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
	Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
	I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
	Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
	And afterward consort you till bed-time:
	My present business calls me from you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell till then: I will go lose myself,
	And wander up and down to view the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I commend you to your own content.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He that commends me to mine own content,
	Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
	I to the world am like a drop of water
	That in the ocean seeks another drop;
	Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
	Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
	So I, to find a mother and a brother,
	In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Dromio of Ephesus.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here comes the almanack of my true date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
	The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
	The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
	My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
	She is so hot because the meat is cold;
	The meat is cold because you come not home;
	You come not home because you have no stomach;
	You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
	But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
	Are penitent for your default to-day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
	Where have you left the money that I gave you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O!--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
	To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper;
	The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not in a sportive humour now.
	Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
	We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
	So great a charge from thine own custody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
	I from my mistress come to you in post;
	If I return, I shall be post indeed,
	For she will score your fault upon my pate.
	Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock
	And strike you home without a messenger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Dromio, come; these jests are out of season;
	Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
	Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
	And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
	Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
	My mistress and her sister stays for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,
	In what safe place you have bestow'd my money;
	Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
	That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
	Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
	Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
	But not a thousand marks between you both.
	If I should pay your worship those again,
	Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy mistress' marks! what mistress, slave, hast thou?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
	She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
	And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
	Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DIRECTION>
Strikes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
	Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

</DROMIO EPH.>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon my life, by some device or other
	The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
	They say this town is full of cozenage;
	As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
	Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
	Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
	Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
	And many such-like liberties of sin:
	If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
	I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
	I greatly fear my money is not safe

<DIRECTION>
Enter Adriana and Luciana.
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither my husband, nor the slave return'd,
	That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
	Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
	And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
	Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
	A man is master of his liberty:
	Time is their master, and, when they see time,
	They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should their liberty than ours be more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because their business still lies out o' door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! know he is the bridle of your will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's none but asses will be bridled so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
	There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
	But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
	The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
	Are their males' subjects and at their controls.
	Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
	Lords of the wide world, and wild wat'ry seas,
	Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
	Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
	Are masters to their females and their lords:
	Then, let your will attend on their accords.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How if your husband start some other where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Till he come home again, I would forbear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause;
	They can be meek that have no other cause.
	A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
	We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
	But were we burden'd with like weight of pain,
	As much, or more we should ourselves complain:
	So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
	With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me:
	But if thou live to see like right bereft.
	This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
	Here comes your man: now is your husband nigh.

<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
	Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully, that I could scarce understand them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
	It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO EPH.>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horn-mad, thou villain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean not cuckold-mad; but, sure, he is stark mad.
	When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
	He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
	''Tis dinner time,' quoth I; 'my gold!' quoth he:
	'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'my gold!' quoth he:
	'Will you come home?' quoth I: 'my gold!' quoth he:
	'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
	'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'my gold!' quoth he:
	'My mistress, sir,' quoth I: 'hang up thy mistress!
	I know not thy mistress: out on thy mistress!'

<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quoth who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quoth my master:
	'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
	So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
	I thank him, I bear home upon my shoulders;
	For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

</ADRIANA>
<DROMIO EPH.>

	And he will bless that cross with other beating:
	Between you, I shall have a holy head.

	Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I so round with you as you with me,
	That like a football you do spurn me thus?

	<DIALOGUE>
	His company must do his minions grace,
	Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
	Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
	From my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it:
	Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
	If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
	Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
	Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
	That's not my fault; he's master of my state:
	What ruins are in me that can be found
	By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
	Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
	A sunny look of his would soon repair;
	But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
	And feeds from home: poor I am but his stale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Self-harming jealousy! fie! beat it hence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfeeling fools can with such wrengs dispense.
	I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
	Or else what lets it but he would be here?
	Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain:
	Would that alone, alone he would detain,
	So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
	I see, the jewel best enamelled
	Will lose his beauty; and though gold bides still
	That others touch, yet often touching will

	The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
	Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
	Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out.
	By computation, and mine host's report,
	I could not speak with Dromio since at first
	I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Dromio of Syracuse.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
	As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
	You know no Centaur? You receiv'd no gold?
	Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
	My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>

	Even now, even here, not half-an-hour since.

	I did not see you since you sent me hence,

	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
	And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
	For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad to see you in this merry vein:

	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, dost thou jeer, and flout me in the teeth?

<DROMIO SYR.>

	Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest.
	Upon what bargain do you give it me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that I familiarly sometimes
	Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,
	Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
	And make a common of my serious hours.
	When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
	But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
	If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
	And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
	Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sconce, call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head and insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But, I pray, sir, why am I beaten?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou not know?

</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>

	Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>

	Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath a wherefore.

<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>

<DROMIO SYR.>

<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank me, sir! for what?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir: I think the meat wants that I have

<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In good time, sir; what's that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	By what rule, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May he not do it by fine and recovery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts: and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet be loseth it in a kind of jollity.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, not sound, I pray you.

</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure ones then.

	Name them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your reason was not substantial, why there is not time to recover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
<DROMIO SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DROMIO SYR.>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>

</DIRECTION>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:
	Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects,
	I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
	The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
	That never words were music to thine ear,
	That never object pleasing in thine eye,
	That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
	That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
	Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
	How comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it,
	That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
	Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
	That, undividable, incorporate,
	Am better than thy dear self's better part.
	Ah! do not tear away thyself from me,
	For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
	A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
	And take unmingled thence that drop again,
	Without addition or diminishing,
	As take from me thyself and not me too.
	How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,
	And that this body, consecrate to thee,
	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
	Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
	And hurl the name of husband in my face,
	And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
	And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
	And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
	I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.
	I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
	For if we two be one and thou play false,
	I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
	Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
	Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
	I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

	Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
	But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
	Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
	Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
	Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
	Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
	If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
	Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
	Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
	Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

	To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme!
	What! was I married to her in my dream?

	Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
	My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours;
	Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
	To see the making of her carkanet,
	And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
	But here's a villain, that would face me down
	He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
	And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
	And that I did deny my wife and house.
	Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>
<DROMIO EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;

<LUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And may it be that you have quite forgot A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
	Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
	Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
	If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
	Then, for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
	Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
	Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
	Let not my sister read it in your eye;
	Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
	Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
	Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
	Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
	Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
	Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
	What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
	'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,
	And let her read it in thy looks at board:
	Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
	Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
	Alas! poor women, make us but believe,
	Being compact of credit, that you love us;
	Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
	We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
	Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
	Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
	'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
	When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCE>
<ANTIPHOLUS SYR.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet mistress,--what your name is else, I know not,
	Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
	Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
	Than our earth's wonder; more than earth divine.
	Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak:
	Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
	Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
	The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
	Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
	To make it wander in an unknown field?
	Are you a god? would you create me new?
	Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
	But if that I am I, then well I know
	Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
	Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:
	Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
	O! train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
	To drown me in thy sister flood of tears:
	Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote:
	Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
	And as a bed I'll take them and there lie;
	And, in that glorious supposition think
	He gains by death that hath such means to die:
	Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

	A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
	I promised your presence and the chain;
	But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
	Belike you thought our love would last too long,

<ANGELO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saving your merry humour, here's the note
	How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat.
	The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
	Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
	Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
	I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
	For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.

	I am not furnish'd with the present money;

	Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

	A devil in an everlasting garment hath him,

	A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands

	Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
	Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
	Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
	On purpose shut the doors against his way.
	My way is now to hie home to his house,

	I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears. I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep; raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont her brat; and, I think, when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

	It was the copy of our conference:

<ABBESS>

	And thereof came it that the man was mad:
	The venom clamours of a jealous woman
	Poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
	It seems, his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
	And thereof comes it that his head is light.
	Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
	Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
	Thereof the raging fire of fever bred:
	And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
	Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:
	Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
	But moody moping, and dull melancholy,
	Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
	And at her heels a huge infectious troop
	Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
	In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest
	To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
	The consequence is then, thy jealous fits
	Have scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.

	May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
	Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
	At your important letters, this ill day
	A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
	That desperately he hurried through the street,--
	With him his bondman, all as mad as he,--
	Doing displeasure to the citizens
	By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
	Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
	Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
	Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
	That here and there his fury had committed.
	Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
	He broke from those that had the guard of him,
	And with his mad attendant and himself,
	Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords
	Met us again, and, madly bent on us
	Chas'd us away, till, raising of more aid
	We came again to bind them. Then they fled
	Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
	And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,
	And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
	Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
	Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
	Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.

	Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate
	And bid the lady abbess come to me.

	Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
	My master preaches patience to him, and the while
	His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;

	Between them they will kill the conjurer.

<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My liege, I am advised what I say:
	Neither disturb'd with the effect of wine,
	Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
	Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
	This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
	That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
	Could witness it, for he was with me then;
	Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
	Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
	Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
	Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
	I went to seek him: in the street I met him,
	And in his company that gentleman.
	There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
	That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
	Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
	He did arrest me with an officer.
	I did obey, and sent my peasant home
	For certain ducats: he with none return'd.
	Then fairly I bespoke the officer
	To go in person with me to my house.
	By the way we met
	My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
	Of vile confederates: along with them
	They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
	A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
	A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
	A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
	A living-dead man. This pernicious slave,
	Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
	And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
	And with no face, as 'twere, out-facing me,
	Cries out, I was possess'd. Then, altogether
	They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
	And in a dark and dankish vault at home
	There left me and my man, both bound together;
	Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
	I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
	Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
	To give me ample satisfaction
	For these deep shames and great indignities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>
<ANGELO>

	My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
	That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
	Heard you confess you had the chain of him
	After you first forswore it on the mart;
	And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
	And then you fled into this abbey here,
	From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

</MERCHANT_2>
<ANTIPHOLUS EPH.>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never came within these abbey walls;

	Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
	I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
	If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;

	You say he din'd at home; the goldsmith here
	Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
