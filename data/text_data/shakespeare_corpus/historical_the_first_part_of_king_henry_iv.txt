<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
	To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote.
	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
	Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
	No more shall trenching war channel her fields,
	Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
	Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
	Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
	All of one nature, of one substance bred,
	Did lately meet in the intestine shock
	And furious close of civil butchery,
	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
	March all one way, and be no more oppos'd
	Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies:
	The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
	As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,--
	Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
	We are impressed and engag'd to fight,--
	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
	Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb
	To chase these pagans in those holy fields
	Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
	For our advantage on the bitter cross.
	But this our purpose is a twelvemonth old,
	And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
	Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
	What yesternight our council did decree
	In forwarding this dear expedience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My liege, this haste was hot in question,
	And many limits of the charge set down
	But yesternight; when all athwart there came
	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
	Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
	And a thousand of his people butchered;
	Upon whose dead corpse' there was such misuse,
	Such beastly shameless transformation
	By those Welshwomen done, as may not be
	Without much shame re-told or spoken of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems then that the tidings of this broil
	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This match'd with other like, my gracious lord;
	For more uneven and unwelcome news
	Came from the north and thus it did import:
	On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
	Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
	That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
	At Holmedon met,
	Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;
	As by discharge of their artillery,
	And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
	For he that brought them, in the very heat
	And pride of their contention did take horse,
	Uncertain of the issue any way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is a dear and true industrious friend,
	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
	Stain'd with the variation of each soil
	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;
	Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
	Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
	On Holmedon's plains: of prisoners Hotspur took
	Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
	To beaten Douglas, and the Earls of Athol,
	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
	And is not this an honourable spoil?
	A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In faith,
	It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin
	In envy that my Lord Northumberland
	Should be the father to so blest a son,
	A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
	Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;
	Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
	See riot and dishonour stain the brow
	Of my young Harry. O! that it could be prov'd
	That some night-tripping fairy had exchang'd
	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
	And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet.
	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
	Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
	Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd,
	To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,
	I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,
	Malevolent to you in all aspects;
	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
	The crest of youth against your dignity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have sent for him to answer this;
	And for this cause a while we must neglect
	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
	Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
	But come yourself with speed to us again;
	For more is to be said and to be done
	Than out of anger can be uttered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, my hege.

<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Same. An Apartment of the Prince's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter the Prince and Falstaff.
</DIRECTION>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colour'd taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, 'that wandering knight so fair.' And, I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king,--as, God save thy Grace,--majesty, I should say, for grace thou wilt have none,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! none?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon; and let men say, we be men of good government, being governed as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed as the sea is, by the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by;' and spent with crying 'Bring in:' now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and where it would not, I have used my credit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, and so used it that, were it not here apparent that thou art their apparent.--But, I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king, and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antick the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; thou shalt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou judgest false already; I mean, thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For obtaining of suits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat, or a lugged bear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast the most unsavory similes, and art, indeed, the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince; but, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man regards it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over; by the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain: I'll be damned for never a king's son in Christendom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zounds! where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one; an I do not, call me a villain and baffle me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying to purse-taking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Poins, at a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation. Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O! if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand!' to a true man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow, Ned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? What says Sir John Sack-and-Sugar? Jack! how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock, early at Gadshill! There are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards for you all; you have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies to night in Rochester; I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go I will stuff your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear ye, Yedward: if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you for going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will, chops?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hal, wilt thou make one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that's well said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone: I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be believed, that the true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, thou latter spring! Farewell, All-hallown summer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Falstaff.
</DIRECTION>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid; yourself and I will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head from my shoulders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how shall we part with them in setting forth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tut! our horses they shall not see, I'll tie them in the wood; our vizards we will change after we leave them; and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to inmask our noted outward garments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap; there I'll sup. Farewell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you all, and will awhile uphold
	The unyok'd humour of your idleness:
	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
	To smother up his beauty from the world,
	That when he please again to be himself,
	Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
	If all the year were playing holidays,
	To sport would be as tedious as to work;
	But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
	So, when this loose behaviour I throw off,
	And pay the debt I never promised,
	By how much better than my word I am
	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
	And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
	My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
	I'll so offend to make offence a skill;
	Redeeming time when men think least I will.

<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
	Unapt to stir at these indignities,
	And you have found me; for accordingly
	You tread upon my patience: but, be sure,
	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
	Mighty, and to be fear'd, than my condition,
	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
	And therefore lost that title of respect
	Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WORCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves

<NORTHUMBERLAND>

	My lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTHUMBERLAND>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
	Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
	And majesty might never yet endure
	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
	You have good leave to leave us; when we need
	Your use and counsel we shall send for you
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Worcester.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Northumberland.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were about to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, my good lord.
	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
	As is deliver'd to your majesty:
	Either envy, therefore, or misprision
	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTHUMBERLAND>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My liege, I did deny no prisoners:
	But I remember, when the fight was done,
	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin, new reap'd,
	Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home:
	He was perfumed like a milliner,
	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
	He gave his nose and took't away again;
	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
	Took it in snuff: and still he smil'd and talk'd;
	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
	He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corpse
	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
	With many holiday and lady terms
	He question'd me; among the rest, demanded
	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
	I then all smarting with my wounds being cold,
	To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
	Out of my grief and my impatience
	Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what,
	He should, or he should not; for he made me mad
	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
	Of guns, and drums, and wounds,--God save the mark!--
	And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
	And that it was great pity, so it was,
	This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
	Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
	He would himself have been a soldier.
	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
	I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
	And I beseech you, let not his report
	Come current for an accusation
	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<BLUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
	Whatever Harry Percy then had said
	To such a person and in such a place,
	At such a time, with all the rest re-told,
	May reasonably die and never rise
	To do him wrong, or any way impeach
	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLUNT>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
	But with proviso and exception,
	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
	Against the great magician, damn'd Glendower,
	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then
	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
	Shall we buy treason, and indent with fears,
	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
	For I shall never hold that man my friend
	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Revolted Mortimer!
	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
	But by the chance of war: to prove that true

	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,
	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
	In single opposition, hand to hand,
	He did confound the best part of an hour
	In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
	Three times they breath'd and three times did they drink,
	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,
	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
	Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.
	Never did base and rotten policy
	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;

	Receive so many, and all willingly:

	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,

	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem

	Into the good thoughts of the world again;
	Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt

Tut! there are other Troyans that thou dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace; that would, if matters should be looked into, for their own credit sake make all whole. I am joined with no foot-land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio-purple-hued malt worms; but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the commonwealth; or, rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots.

I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth.

	He could be contented; why is he not then? In respect of the love he bears our house: he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house. Let me see some more.
	The purpose you undertake is dangerous;--
	Why, that's certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.
	The purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.
	Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action. 'Zounds! an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month, and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings. O! I could divide myself and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action. Hang him! let him tell the king; we are prepared. I will set forward to-night

	Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?
	Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
	And start so often when thou sitt'st alone?
	Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,
	And given my treasures and my rights of thee
	To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?
	In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
	And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,
	Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,
	Cry, 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
	Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
	Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
	Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
	Of prisoners' ransom, and of soldiers slain,
	And all the currents of a heady fight.
	Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,
	And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
	That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,
	Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
	And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
	Such as we see when men restrain their breath
	On some great sudden hest. O! what portents are these?
	Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
	And I must know it, else he loves me not.

<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,--by the Lord, so they call me,--and when I am king of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than--'Eight shillings and sixpence,' and--'You are welcome,' with this shrill addition,--'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,' or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling 'Francis!' that his tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and I'll show thee a precedent.

	Where is it, Jack? where is it?

</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon poor four of us.

</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, a hundred, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scap'd by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose; my buckler out through and through; my sword hacked like a hand-saw: ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.

<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak, sirs; how was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<GADSHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We four set upon some dozen,--

</GADSHILL>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixteen, at least, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<GADSHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And bound them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GADSHILL>
<PETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, they were not bound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETO>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<GADSHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GADSHILL>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, fought ye with them all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All! I know not what ye call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two of them: two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou knowest my old ward; here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four, Hal; I told thee four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, ay, he said four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven? why, there were but four even now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In buckram.

</FALSTAFF>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, four, in buckram suits.

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.

<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do so, for it is worth the listening to.
	These nine in buckram that I told thee of,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, two more already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their points being broken,--

<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down fell their hose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Began to give me ground; but I followed me close, came in foot and hand and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in Kendal-green came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These lies are like the father that begets them; gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallowketch,--

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth the truth?

<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds! an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons were as plenty as blackberries I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.

	'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's-tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O! for breath to utter what is like thee; you tailor's yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing-tuck;--

	Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.

	Mark, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We two saw you four set on four and you bound them, and were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you four, and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still ran and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<POINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POINS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? Should I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules; but beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true prince. Instinct is a great matter, I was a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you! What! shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Faith, I ran when I saw others run.

	Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so hacked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<PETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETO>
<BARDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before; I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARDOLPH>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O villain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away. What instinct hadst thou for it?

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring. A plague of sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was Sir John Bracy from your father: you must to the court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amaimon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold, and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook--what a plague call you him?

</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>

</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art thou not horribly afeard? thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>

	Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the particulars of my life.

	Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.

<FALSTAFF>

	Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to make mine eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein.

</QUICKLY>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace, good pint-pot! peace, good tickle-brain! Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion; but chiefly, a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point; why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? a question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears, not in pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or by'r lady, inclining to threescore; and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll play my father.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, here I am set.

<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace: there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of a fat old man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swoln parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it? wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it? wherein cunning but in craft? wherein crafty but in villany? wherein villanous but in all things? wherein worthy but in nothing?

<FALSTAFF>

	But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know. That he is old, the more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins; but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company: banish not him thy Harry's company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

<DIRECTION>
Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Mortimer, and Glendower.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These promises are fair, the parties sure,
	And our induction full of prosperous hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
	Will you sit down?
	And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
	I have forgot the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, here it is.
	Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur;
	For by that name as oft as Lancaster
	Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
	A rising sigh he wishes you in heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you in hell, as often as he hears
	Owen Glendower spoke of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot blame him: at my nativity
	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
	Of burning cressets; and at my birth
	The frame and huge foundation of the earth
	Shak'd like a coward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself had never been born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say the earth did shake when I was born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I say the earth was not of my mind,
	If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
	And not in fear of your nativity.
	Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
	In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
	Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
	By the imprisoning of unruly wind
	Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
	Shakes the old beldam earth, and topples down
	Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
	Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
	In passion shook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin, of many men
	I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
	To tell you once again that at my birth
	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
	The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
	Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
	These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
	And all the courses of my life do show
	I am not in the roll of common men.
	Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
	That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
	Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
	And bring him out that is but woman's son
	Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
	And hold me pace in deep experiments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
	I'll to dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace, cousin Percy! you will make him mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, so can I, or so can any man;
	But will they come when you do call for them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, I can teach thee, cousin, to command
	The devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
	By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
	If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
	And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
	O! while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come;
	No more of this unprofitable chat.

</MORTIMER>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
	Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
	And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
	Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
	How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
	According to our threefold order ta'en?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The archdeacon hath divided it
	Into three limits very equally.
	England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
	By south and east, is to my part assign'd:
	All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
	And all the fertile land within that bound,
	To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
	The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
	And our indentures tripartite are drawn,
	Which being sealed interchangeably,
	A business that this night may execute,
	To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
	And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
	To meet your father and the Scottish power,
	As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
	My father Glendower is not ready yet,
	Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Glendower.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Within that space you may have drawn together
	Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;
	And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
	From whom you now must steal and take no leave;
	For there will be a world of water shed
	Upon the parting of your wives and you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
	In quantity equals not one of yours:
	See how this river comes me cranking in,
	And cuts me from the best of all my land
	A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
	I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,
	And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
	In a new channel, fair and evenly:
	It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
	To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not wind! it shall, it must; you see it doth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, but
	Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
	With like advantage on the other side;
	Gelding the opposed continent as much,
	As on the other side it takes from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<WORCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, but a little charge will trench him here,
	And on this north side win this cape of land;
	And then he runs straight and even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORCESTER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have it so; a little charge will do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not have it alter'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will not you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, nor you shall not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who shall say me nay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that will I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me not understand you then:
	Speak it in Welsh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can speak English, lord, as well as you,
	For I was train'd up in the English court;
	Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
	Many an English ditty lovely well,
	And gave the tongue an helpful ornament;
	A virtue that was never seen in you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, and I'm glad of it with all my heart.
	I had rather be a kitten, and cry mew
	Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
	I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
	Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
	And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
	Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
	'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
	To any well-deserving friend;
	But in the way of bargain, mark you me,
	I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
	Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The moon shines fair, you may away by night:
	I'll haste the writer and withal
	Break with your wives of your departure hence:
	I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
	So much she doteth on her Mortimer.

<DIRECTION>
Exit.

<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot choose: sometimes he angers me
	With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,
	Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
	And of a dragon, and a finless fish,
	A clip-wing'd griffin, and a moulten raven,
	A couching lion, and a ramping cat,
	And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
	As puts me from my faith. I'll tell thee what;
	He held me last night at least nine hours
	In reckoning up the several devils' names
	That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum!' and 'well, go to.'
	But mark'd him not a word. O! he's as tedious
	As a tired horse, a railing wife;
	Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live
	With cheese and garlick in a windmill, far,
	Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
	In any summer-house in Christendom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOTSPUR>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
	Exceedingly well read, and profited
	In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
	And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
	As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
	He holds your temper in a high respect,
	And curbs himself even of his natural scope
	When you do cross his humour; faith, he does.
	I warrant you, that man is not alive
	Might so have tempted him as you have done,
	Without the taste of danger and reproof:
	But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<WORCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In faith, my lord, you are too wilfulblame;
	And since your coming hither have done enough
	To put him quite beside his patience.
	You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
	Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
	And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
	Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
	Defect of manners, want of government,
	Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain:
	The least of which haunting a nobleman
	Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
	Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
	Beguiling them of commendation.
	</DIALOGUE>

Glendower speaks to Lady Mortimer in Welsh, and she answers him in the same.

	In such a parley would I answer thee
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She speaks again.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
	And that's a feeling disputation:
	But I will never be a truant, love,
	Till I have learn'd thy language; for thy tongue
	Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
	Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
	With ravishing division, to her lute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIMER>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.

<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! I am ignorance itself in this.

</MORTIMER>
<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She bids you
	Upon the wanton rushes lay you down
	And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
	And she will sing the song that pleaseth you,
	And on your eye-lids crown the god of sleep,
	Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
	Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
	As is the difference between day and night
	The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
	Begins his golden progress in the east.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLENDOWER>
<MORTIMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
	By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.

<GLENDOWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do so;

	As if thou never walk'dst further than Finsbury.
	Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,

	I know not whether God will have it so,
	For some displeasing service I have done,

	But thou dost in thy passages of life
	Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
	For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
	Could such inordinate and low desires,
	Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
	Such barren pleasures, rude society,
	As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
	Accompany the greatness of thy blood
	And hold their level with thy princely heart?

</K_HENRY>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So please your majesty, I would I could
	Quit all offences with as clear excuse
	As well as I am doubtless I can purge
	Myself of many I am charg'd withal:
	Yet such extenuation let me beg,
	As, in reproof of many tales devis'd,
	Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
	By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers,
	I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
	Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
	Find pardon on my true submission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
	At thy affections, which do hold a wing
	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost,
	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
	And art almost an alien to the hearts
	Of all the court and princes of my blood.
	The hope and expectation of thy time
	Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
	Prophetically do forethink thy fall.
	Had I so lavish of my presence been,
	So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
	Had still kept loyal to possession
	And left me in reputeless banishment,
	A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
	By being seldom seen, I could not stir,
	But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
	That men would tell their children, 'This is he;'
	Others would say, 'Where? which is Bolingbroke?'
	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
	And dress'd myself in such humility
	That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
	Even in the presence of the crowned king.
	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
	My presence, like a robe pontifical,
	Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
	Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast,
	And won by rareness such solemnity.
	The skipping king, he ambled up and down
	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
	Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
	Had his great name profaned with their scorns,
	And gave his countenance, against his name,
	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
	Of every beardless vain comparative;
	Grew a companion to the common streets,
	Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
	That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
	They surfeited with honey and began
	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
	More than a little is by much too much.
	So, when he had occasion to be seen,
	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
	As, sick and blunted with community,
	Afford no extraordinary gaze,
	Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
	But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down,
	Slept in his face, and render'd such aspect
	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
	Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.
	And in that very line, Harry, stand'st thou;
	For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
	With vile participation: not an eye
	But is aweary of thy common sight,
	Save mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more;
	Which now doth that I would not have it do,
	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

	For all the world,
	As thou art to this hour was Richard then
	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh;
	And even as I was then is Percy now.
	Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
	He hath more worthy interest to the state
	Than thou the shadow of succession;
	For of no right, nor colour like to right,
	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
	Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
	What never-dying honour hath he got
	Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,
	Holds from all soldiers chief majority,
	And military title capital,
	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.
	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
	This infant warrior, in his enterprises
	Discomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once,
	Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
	The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
	Capitulate against us and are up.
	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
	Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
	Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
	Base inclination, and the start of spleen,
	To fight against me under Percy's pay,
	To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,
	To show how much thou art degenerate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
	And God forgive them, that so much have sway'd
	Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
	I will redeem all this on Percy's head,
	And in the closing of some glorious day
	Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
	When I will wear a garment all of blood
	And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
	Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
	And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
	That this same child of honour and renown,
	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
	And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.
	For every honour sitting on his helm,--
	Would they were multitudes, and on my head
	My shames redoubled!--for the time will come
	That I shall make this northern youth exchange
	His glorious deeds for my indignities.
	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
	And I will call him to so strict account
	That he shall render every glory up,
	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
	This, in the name of God, I promise here:
	The which, if he be pleas'd I shall perform,
	I do beseech your majesty may salve
	The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
	If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
	And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
	Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady's loose gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well, I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a church! Company, villanous company, hath been the spoil of me.

	Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARDOLPH>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, there is it: come, sing me a bawdy song; make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be; virtuous enough: swore little; diced not above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house not above once in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I borrowed three or four times; lived well and in good compass; and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<BARDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARDOLPH>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life: thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lanthorn in the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee: thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.

<BARDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARDOLPH>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a Death's head, or a memento mori: I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be, 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an igius fatuus or a ball of wildfire, there's no purchase in money. O! thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light. Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two-and-thirty years; God reward me for it!

	Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched, I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.
	</DIALOGUE>

	O! if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees. But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, or honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! Why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed rascal, if there were any thing in thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy-houses, and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded; if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will stand to it, you will not pocket up wrong. Art thou not ashamed?

	On any soul remov'd but on his own.
	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
	That with our small conjunction we should on,
	To see how fortune is dispos'd to us;

	All at one cast? to set so rich a main

	But yet, I would your father had been here.

	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
	The eye of reason may pry in upon us:

	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen's sons; inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lief hear the devil as a drum; such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace; ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals, lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on; for, indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or the red-nose inn-keeper of Daventry. But that's all one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

<BLUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And God defend but still I should stand so,
	So long as out of limit and true rule
	You stand against anointed majesty.
	But, to my charge. The king hath sent to know
	The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
	You conjure from the breast of civil peace
	Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
	Audacious cruelty. If that the king
	Have any way your good deserts forgot,--
	Which he confesseth to be manifold,--
	He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
	You shall have your desires with interest,
	And pardon absolute for yourself and these
	Herein misled by your suggestion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLUNT>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The king is kind; and well we know the king
	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
	My father and my uncle and myself
	Did give him that same royalty he wears;
	And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,
	Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
	My father gave him welcome to the shore;
	And when he heard him swear and vow to God
	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
	To sue his livery and beg his peace,
	With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
	My father, in kind heart and pity mov'd,
	Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
	Now when the lords and barons of the realm
	Perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him,
	The more and less came in with cap and knee;
	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
	Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
	Gave him their heirs as pages, follow'd him
	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
	He presently, as greatness knows itself,
	Steps me a little higher than his vow
	Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
	And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
	Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
	This seeming brow of justice, did he win
	The hearts of all that he did angle for;
	Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
	Of all the favourites that the absent king
	In deputation left behind him here,
	When he was personal in the Irish war.

<BLUNT>

	Tut, I came not to hear this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLUNT>
<HOTSPUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then to the point.
	In short time after, he depos'd the king;
	Soon after that, depriv'd him of his life;
	And, in the neck of that, task'd the whole state;
	To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March--
	Who is, if every owner were well plac'd,
	Indeed his king--to be engag'd in Wales,
	There without ransom to lie forfeited;
	Disgrac'd me in my happy victories;
	Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
	Rated my uncle from the council-board;
	In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong;
	And in conclusion drove us to seek out
	This head of safety; and withal to pry
	Into his title, the which we find
	Too indirect for long continuance.

	Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd

	Bring him our purposes; and so farewell.

	The king with mighty and quick-raised power
	Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
	What with the sickness of Northumberland,--
	Whose power was in the first proportion,--
	And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
	Who with them was a rated sinew too,
	And comes not in, o'er-rul'd by prophecies,--

	It pleas'd your majesty to turn your looks

	When yet you were in place and in account
	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
	It was myself, my brother, and his son,

	That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,
	Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster.
	To this we swore our aid: but, in short space

	And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
	What with our help, what with the absent king,
	What with the injuries of a wanton time,
	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
	And the contrarious winds that held the king
	So long in his unlucky Irish wars,
	That all in England did repute him dead:
	And from this swarm of fair advantages
	You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
	To gripe the general sway into your hand;
	Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster;
	And being fed by us you us'd us so
	As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,
	Useth the sparrow: did oppress our nest,
	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
	That even our love durst not come near your sight
	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
	We were enforc'd, for safety's sake, to fly
	Out of your sight and raise this present head;
	Whereby we stand opposed by such means
	As you yourself have forg'd against yourself
	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
	And violation of all faith and troth
	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.

	These things indeed, you have articulate,
	Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
	To face the garment of rebellion
	With some fine colour that may please the eye
	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
	Of hurlyburly innovation:
	And never yet did insurrection want
	Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
	Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
	Of pell-mell havoc and confusion.

<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In both our armies there is many a soul
	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
	The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
	In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
	This present enterprise set off his head,
	I do not think a braver gentleman,
	More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
	More daring or more bold, is now alive
	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
	I have a truant been to chivalry;
	And so I hear he doth account me too;
	Yet this before my father's majesty--
	I am content that he shall take the odds
	Of his great name and estimation,
	And will, to save the blood on either side,
	Try fortune with him in a single fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
	Albeit considerations infinite
	Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
	We love our people well; even those we love
	That are misled upon your cousin's part;
	And, will they take the offer of our grace,
	Both he and they and you, yea, every man
	Shall be my friend again, and I'll be his.
	So tell your cousin, and bring me word
	What he will do; but if he will not yield,
	Rebuke and dread correction wait on us,
	And they shall do their office. So, be gone:
	We will not now be troubled with reply;
	We offer fair, take it advisedly.

No. What is honour? a word. What is that word, honour? Air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. It is insensible then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I'll none of it: honour is a mere scutcheon; and so ends my catechism.

	Then are we all undone.
	It is not possible, it cannot be,
	The king should keep his word in loving us;
	He will suspect us still, and find a time
	To punish this offence in other faults:
	Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
	For treason is but trusted like the fox,
	Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd, and lock'd up,
	Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
	Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
	Interpretation will misquote our looks,
	And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
	The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
	My nephew's trespass may be well forgot,
	It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood;
	And an adopted name of privilege,
	A hare-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen.
	All his offences live upon my head
	And on his father's: we did train him on;

	Making you ever better than his praise,
	By still dispraising praise valu'd with you;
	And, which became him like a prince indeed,
	He made a blushing cital of himself,
	And chid his truant youth with such a grace
	As if he master'd there a double spirit
	Of teaching and of learning instantly.
	There did he pause. But let me tell the world,

	Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day, I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too, to-morrow. 'Sblood! 'twas time to counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die, is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man; but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed. The better part of valour is discretion; in the which better part, I have saved my life. 'Zounds! I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead: how, if he should counterfeit too and rise? By my faith I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me: therefore, sirrah <span class="stage>[stabbing him], with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me

	Didst thou? Lord, Lord! how this world is given to lying. I grant you I was down and out of breath, and so was he; but we rose both at an instant, and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be believed, so; if not, let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it, 'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
