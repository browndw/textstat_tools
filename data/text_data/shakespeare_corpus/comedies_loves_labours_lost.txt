Scene.--Navarre.

<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
The King of Navarre's Park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter the King, Berowne, Longaville, and Dumaine.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
	Live register'd upon our brazen tombs,
	And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
	When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
	The endeavour of this present breath may buy
	That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
	And make us heirs of all eternity.
	Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
	That war against your own affections
	And the huge army of the world's desires,--
	Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
	Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
	Our court shall be a little academe,
	Still and contemplative in living art.
	You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville,
	Have sworn for three years' term to live with me,
	My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
	That are recorded in this schedule here:
	Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
	That his own hand may strike his honour down
	That violates the smallest branch herein.
	If you are arm'd to do, as sworn to do,
	Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast:
	The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
	Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
	Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<DUMAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified:
	The grosser manner of these world's delights
	He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
	To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
	With all these living in philosophy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUMAINE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can but say their protestation over;
	So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
	That is, to live and study here three years.
	But there are other strict observances;
	As, not to see a woman in that term,
	Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
	And one day in a week to touch no food,
	And but one meal on every day beside;
	The which I hope is not enrolled there:
	And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
	And not be seen to wink of all the day,--
	When I was wont to think no harm all night
	And make a dark night too of half the day,--
	Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
	O! these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
	Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me say no, my liege, an if you please.
	I only swore to study with your Grace,
	And stay here in your court for three years' space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
	What is the end of study? let me know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that to know which else we should not know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on then; I will swear to study so,
	To know the thing I am forbid to know;
	As thus: to study where I well may dine,
	When I to feast expressly am forbid;
	Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
	When mistresses from common sense are hid;
	Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,
	Study to break it, and not break my troth.
	If study's gain be thus, and this be so,
	Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
	Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These be the stops that hinder study quite,
	And train our intellects to vain delight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
	Which, with pain purchas'd doth inherit pain:
	As, painfully to pore upon a book,
	To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
	Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
	Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
	So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
	Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
	Study me how to please the eye indeed,
	By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
	Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,
	And give him light that it was blinded by.
	Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,
	That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;
	Small have continual plodders ever won,
	Save base authority from others' books.
	These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
	That give a name to every fixed star,
	Have no more profit of their shining nights
	Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
	Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
	And every godfather can give a name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How well he's read, to reason against reading!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DUMAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUMAINE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<DUMAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How follows that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUMAINE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fit in his place and time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<DUMAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In reason nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUMAINE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something then, in rime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
	That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, say I am: why should proud summer boast
	Before the birds have any cause to sing?
	Why should I joy in an abortive birth?
	At Christmas I no more desire a rose
	Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
	But like of each thing that in season grows.
	So you, to study now it is too late,
	Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sit you out: go home, Berowne: adieu!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
	And though I have for barbarism spoke more
	Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
	Yet confident I'll keep to what I swore,
	And bide the penance of each three years' day.
	Give me the paper; let me read the same;
	And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Item, That no woman shall come within a mile of my court. Hath this been proclaimed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four days ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see the penalty. On pain of losing her tongue. Who devised this penalty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, that did I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet lord, and why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dangerous law against gentility!
	Item. If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.
	This article, my liege, yourself must break;
	For well you know here comes in embassy
	The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
	A maid of grace and complete majesty--
	About surrender up of Aquitaine
	To her decrepit, sick, and bed-rid father:
	Therefore this article is made in vain,
	Or vainly comes th' admired princess hither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What say you, lords? why, this was quite forgot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So study evermore is overshot:
	While it doth study to have what it would,
	It doth forget to do the thing it should;
	And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
	'Tis won as towns with fire; so won, so lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must of force dispense with this decree;
	She must lie here on mere necessity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Necessity will make us all forsworn
	Three thousand times within this three years' space;
	For every man with his affects is born,
	Not by might master'd, but by special grace.
	If I break faith this word shall speak for me,
	I am forsworn 'on mere necessity.'
	So to the laws at large I write my name
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Subscribes.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he that breaks them in the least degree
	Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
	Suggestions are to others as to me;
	But I believe, although I seem so loath,
	I am the last that will last keep his oath.
	But is there no quick recreation granted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
	With a refined traveller of Spain;
	A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
	That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
	One whom the music of his own vain tongue
	Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
	A man of complements, whom right and wrong
	Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
	This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
	For interim to our studies shall relate
	In high-born words the worth of many a knight
	From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
	How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
	But, I protest, I love to hear him lie,
	And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Armado is a most illustrious wight,
	A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
	And, so to study, three years is but short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Dull, with a letter, and Costard.
</DIRECTION>
<DULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is the duke's own person?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DULL>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This, fellow. What wouldst?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<DULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person in flesh and blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DULL>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<DULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Arm--Arm--commends you. There's villany abroad: this letter will tell you more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DULL>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A letter from the magnificent Armado.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hear, or forbear laughing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<LONGAVILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to forbear both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGAVILLE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what manner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is, in manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman, for the form,--in some form.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the following, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you hear this letter with attention?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As we would hear an oracle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent, and sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's God, and body's fostering patron,
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a word of Costard yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be to me and every man that dares not fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No words!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The time when? About the sixth hour; when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper: so much for the time when. Now for the ground which; which, I mean, I walked upon: it is ycleped thy park. Then for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter that most obscene and preposterous event, that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to the place where, it standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that unlettered small-knowing soul,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that shallow vessel,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	which, as I remember, hight Costard,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, with--with,--O! with but with this I passion to say wherewith,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With a wench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a woman. Him, I,--as my everesteemed duty pricks me on,--have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment, by thy sweet Grace's officer, Antony Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, an't please you; I am Antony Dull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DULL>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain,--I keep her as a vessel of thy law's fury; and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning heat of duty,
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not so well as I looked for, but the best that ever I heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I confess the wench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear the proclamation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damosel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was proclaimed 'damosel.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was no damosel neither, sir: she was a 'virgin.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so varied too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This maid will serve my turn, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran and water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
	My Lord Berowne, see him deliver'd o'er:
	And go we, lords, to put in practice that
	Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt King, Longaville, and Dumaine.
</DIRECTION>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
	These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
	Sirrah, come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suffer for the truth, sir: for true it is I was taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why tough senior? why tough senior?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty, and apt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and my saying pretty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou pretty, because little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And therefore apt, because quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak you this in my praise, master?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In thy condign praise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will praise an eel with the same praise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! that an eel is ingenious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That an eel is quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.

	Impossible.

<MOTH>

</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I confess both: they are both the varnish of a complete man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doth amount to one more than two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which the base vulgar do call three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now, here's three studied, ere you'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A most fine figure!

	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy: what great men have been in love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hercules, master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the towngates on his back like a porter; and he was in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A woman, master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of what complexion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me precisely of what complexion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of the sea-water green, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that one of the four complexions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My love is most immaculate white and red.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Define, define, well-educated infant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father's wit, and my mother's tongue, assist me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and pathetical!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she be made of white and red,
	Her faults will ne'er be known,
	For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,
	And fears by pale white shown:
	Then if she fear, or be to blame,
	By this you shall not know,
	For still her cheeks possess the same
	Which native she doth owe.
	A dangerous rime, master, against the reason of white and red.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.

	Sing, boy: my spirit grows heavy in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.

</MOTH>

<DULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard safe: and you must let him take no delight nor no penance, but a' must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park; she is allowed for the day-woman.
	Fare you well.

	Thou shalt be heavily punished.

	Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.

</COSTARD>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shall some see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and therefore I can be quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Moth and Costard.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn,--which is a great argument of falsehood,--if I love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil: there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second clause will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello he regards not: his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory is, to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust, rapier! be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me some extemporal god of rime, for I am sure I shall turn sonneter. Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio

</DIRECTION>
<BOYET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
	Consider whom the king your father sends,
	To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
	Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
	To parley with the sole inheritor
	Of all perfections that a man may owe,
	Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
	Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
	Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
	As Nature was in making graces dear
	When she did starve the general world beside,
	And prodigally gave them all to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYET>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
	Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
	Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
	Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues.
	I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
	Than you much willing to be counted wise
	In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
	But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
	You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
	Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
	Till painful study shall out-wear three years,
	No woman may approach his silent court:
	Therefore to us seemth it a needful course,
	Before we enter his forbidden gates,
	To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
	Bold of your worthiness, we single you
	As our best-moving fair solicitor.
	Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
	On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
	Importunes personal conference with his Grace.
	Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
	Like humble-visag'd suitors, his high will.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know him, madam: at a marriage feast,
	Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
	Of Jacques Falconbridge, solemnized
	In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.
	A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
	Well fitted in the arts, glorious in arms:
	Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
	The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,--
	If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,--
	Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will;
	Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
	It should none spare that come within his power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

	Who are the rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The young Dumaine, a well-accomplish'd youth,
	Of all that virtue love for virtue lov'd:
	Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
	For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
	And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
	I saw him at the Duke Alençon's once;
	And much too little of that good I saw
	Is my report to his great worthiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another of these students at that time
	Was there with him, if I have heard a truth:
	Berowne they call him; but a merrier man,
	Within the limit of becoming mirth,
	I never spent an hour's talk withal.
	His eye begets occasion for his wit;
	For every object that the one doth catch
	The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
	Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
	Delivers in such apt and gracious words,
	That aged ears play truant at his tales,
	And younger hearings are quite ravished;
	So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
	And he and his competitors in oath
	Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
	Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt;
	He rather means to lodge you in the field,
	Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
	Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
	To let you enter his unpeeled house.

<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, your father here doth intimate
	The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
	Being but the one half of an entire sum
	Disbursed by my father in his wars.
	But say that he, or we,--as neither have,--
	Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid
	A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
	One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
	Although not valu'd to the money's worth.
	If then the king your father will restore
	But that one half which is unsatisfied,
	We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
	And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
	But that it seems, he little purposeth,
	For here he doth demand to have repaid
	A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
	On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
	To have his title live in Aquitaine;
	Which we much rather had depart withal,
	And have the money by our father lent,
	Than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.
	Dear princess, were not his requests so far
	From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
	A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
	And go well satisfied to France again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do the king my father too much wrong

	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do protest I never heard of it;
	And if you prove it, I'll repay it back

	It shall suffice me: at which interview
	All liberal reason I will yield unto.

	As honour, without breach of honour, may
	Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
	You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
	But here without you shall be so receiv'd,
	As you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart,
	Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
	Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:

	Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

</BOYET>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BOYET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
	To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire;
	His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
	Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
	His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
	Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
	All senses to that sense did make their repair,
	To feel only looking on fairest of fair,
	Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
	As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
	Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,
	Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd.
	His face's own margent did quote such amazes,
	That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
	I'll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,
	An' you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come to our pavilion: Boyet is dispos'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BOYET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd.
	I only have made a mouth of his eye,
	By adding a tongue which I know will not he.

<ARMADO>

	Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

<MOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Singing.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Concolinel,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key, give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must employ him in a letter to my love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How meanest thou? brawling in French?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you swallowed love by singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin belly-doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away. These are complements, these are humours, these betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men of note,--do you note me?--that most are affected to these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How hast thou purchased this experience?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my penny of observation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But O--but O,--

</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love perhaps, a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost I had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negligent student! learn her by heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By heart, and in heart, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What wilt thou prove?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the instant: by heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am all these three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A message well sympathized: a horse to be ambassador for an ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way is but short: away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As swift as lead, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy meaning, pretty ingenious?
	Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say, lead is slow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are too swift, sir, to say so:
	Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
	He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
	I shoot thee at the swain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thump then, and I flee.

</MOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
	By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
	Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
	My herald is return'd.

</ARMADO>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Moth with Costard.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir. O! sir, plantain, a plain plantain: no l'envoy, no l'envoy: no salve, sir, but a plantain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling: O! pardon me, my stars. Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and the word l'envoy for a salve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
	Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
	I will example it:
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee
	Were still at odds, being but three.
	There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
	Were still at odds, being but three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until the goose came out of door,
	And stay'd the odds by adding four.
	Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my l'envoy.
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
	Were still at odds, being but three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until the goose came out of door,
	Staying the odds by adding four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good l'envoy, ending in the goose.
	Would you desire more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
	Sir, your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat.
	To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
	Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
	Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, and I for a plantain: thus came your argument in;
	Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
	And he ended the market.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<MOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will tell you sensibly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTH>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
	I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
	Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will talk no more of this matter.

</ARMADO>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

	O! marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy, some goose, in this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person: thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMADO>
<COSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, true, and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTARD>
<ARMADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and in lieu thereof, impose upon thee nothing but this:-

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O! that's the Latin word for three farthings: three farthings, remuneration. 'What's the price of this inkle?' 'One penny.' 'No, I'll give you a remuneration:' why, it carries it Remuneration! why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word.

	And I,--

	Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
	This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
	This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
	Regent of love-rimes, lord of folded arms,
	The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
	Liege of all loiterers and malecontents,
	Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
	Sole imperator and great general
	Of trotting 'paritors: O my little heart!

	What I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
	A woman that is like a German clock,

	But being watch'd that it may still go right!
	Nay, to be perjur'd, which is worst of all;
	And, among three, to love the worst of all;
	A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
	With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes;
	Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed
	Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
	And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
	To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
	That Cupid will impose for my neglect
	Of his almighty dreadful little might.
	Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan:

	By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible; true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon, and he it was that might rightly say veni, vidi, vici; which to anatomize in the vulgar--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, he came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw, two; overcame, three. Who came? the king: Why did he come? to see: Why did he see? to overcome: To whom came he? to the beggar: What saw he? the beggar. Whom overcame he? the beggar. The conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's; the captive is enriched: on whose side? the beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose side? the king's, no, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may: Shall I enforce thy love? I could: Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes; for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus, expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part.
	Thine, in the dearest design of Industry, DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.
	Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
	'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey:
	Submissive fall his princely feet before,
	And he from forage will incline to play.
	But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
	Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

	So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
	To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,

	The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
	Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
	Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
	As doth thy face through tears of mine give light,
	Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep.
	No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
	So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
	Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
	And they thy glory through my grief will show
	But do not love thyself, then thou wilt keep
	My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.

	Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:

	Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:
	Vow, alack! for youth unmeet,

	His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
	I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
	And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.
	I heard your guilty rimes, observ'd your fashion,

	Tush! none but minstrels like of sonneting.
	But are you not asham'd? nay, are you not,
	All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
	You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
	But I a beam do find in each of three.
	O! what a scene of foolery have I seen,
	Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen;
	O me! with what strict patience have I sat,

	With men like men, men of inconstancy.
	When shall you see me write a thing in rime?

	Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
	Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
	Fie, painted rhetoric! O! she needs it not:
	To things of sale a seller's praise belongs;
	She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
	A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,

	<DIALOGUE>
	Some salve for perjury.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUMAINE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, 'tis more than need.
	Have at you, then, affection's men-at-arms:
	Consider what you first did swear unto,
	To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
	Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
	Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young,
	And abstinence engenders maladies.
	And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
	In that each of you hath forsworn his book,
	Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
	For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
	Have found the ground of study's excellence
	Without the beauty of a woman's face?
	From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
	They are the ground, the books, the academes,
	From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.
	Why, universal plodding poisons up
	The nimble spirits in the arteries,
	As motion and long-during action tires
	The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
	Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
	You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,
	And study too, the causer of your vow;
	For where is any author in the world
	Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
	Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,
	And where we are our learning likewise is:
	Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
	Do we not likewise see our learning there?
	O! we have made a vow to study, lords,
	And in that vow we have forsworn our books:
	For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
	In leaden contemplation have found out
	Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
	Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
	Other slow arts entirely keep the brain,
	And therefore, finding barren practisers,
	Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
	But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
	Lives not alone immured in the brain,
	But, with the motion of all elements,
	Courses as swift as thought in every power,
	And gives to every power a double power,
	Above their functions and their offices.
	It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
	A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
	A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
	When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
	Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
	Than are the tender horns of cockled snails:
	Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
	For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
	Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
	Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
	As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair;
	And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
	Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
	Never durst poet touch a pen to write
	Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
	O! then his lines would ravish savage ears,
	And plant in tyrants mild humility.
	From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
	They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
	They are the books, the arts, the academes,
	That show, contain, and nourish all the world;
	Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
	Then fools you were these women to forswear,
	Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
	For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
	Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
	Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;
	Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
	Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
	Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
	It is religion to be thus forsworn;
	For charity itself fulfils the law;

	Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass: I do beseech thee, remember thy curtsy; I beseech thee, apparel thy head: and among other importunate and most serious designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his Grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio: but, sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world: but let that pass. The very all of all is, but, sweet heart, I do implore secrecy, that the king would have me present the princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antick, or fire-work. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to crave your assistance.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You weigh me not. O! that's you care not for me.

</PRINCESS>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would you knew:
	An if my face were but as fair as yours,
	My favour were as great; be witness this.
	Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne:
	The numbers true; and, were the numb'ring too,
	I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
	I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs.
	O! he hath drawn my picture in his letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALINE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything like?

</PRINCESS>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much in the letters, nothing in the praise.

	Madam, this glove.

</KATHARINE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he not send you twain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, madam; and moreover,
	Some thousand verses of a faithful lover:
	A huge translation of hypocrisy,
	Vilely compil'd, profound simplicity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This, and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
	The letter is too long by half a mile.

	They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
	That same Berowne I'll torture ere I go.
	O that I knew he were but in by the week!
	How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,
	And wait the season, and observe the times,
	And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rimes,
	And shape his service wholly to my hests,
	And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
	So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
	That he should be my fool, and I his fate.

</ROSALINE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,

	Prepare, madam, prepare!--
	Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
	Against your peace: Love doth approach disguis'd,

	Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

	Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they

	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BOYET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under the cool shade of a sycamore
	I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,
	When, lo! to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
	Toward that shade I might behold addrest
	The king and his companions: warily
	I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
	And overheard what you shall overhear;
	That, by and by, disguis'd they will be here.
	Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
	That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
	Action and accent did they teach him there;
	'Thus must thou speak, and thus thy body bear.'
	And ever and anon they made a doubt
	Presence majestical would put him out;
	'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
	Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
	The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
	I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
	With that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
	Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
	One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd, and swore
	A better speech was never spoke before;
	Another, with his finger and his thumb,
	Cry'd 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
	The third he caper'd and cried, 'All goes well;'
	The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
	With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
	With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
	That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
	To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYET>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what, but what, come they to visit us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BOYET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do, they do; and are apparell'd thus,
	Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
	Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
	And every one his love-feat will advance
	Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
	By favours several which they did bestow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYET>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd:
	For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd,
	And not a man of them shall have the grace,
	Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
	Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
	And then the king will court thee for his dear:
	Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
	So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline,
	And change you favours too; so shall your loves
	Woo contrary, deceiv'd by these removes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALINE>
<KATHARINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in this changing what is your intent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The effect of my intent is, to cross theirs:
	They do it but in mocking merriment;
	And mock for mock is only my intent.
	Their several counsels they unbosom shall
	To loves mistook and so be mock'd withal
	Upon the next occasion that we meet,
	With visages display'd, to talk and greet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALINE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, to the death, we will not move a foot:
	Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;
	But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BOYET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
	And quite divorce his memory from his part.

	This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;

	Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:

	In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
	We four, indeed, confronted were with four
	In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
	And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,

	This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
	Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,

	Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

	Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
	Can any face of brass hold longer out?--
	Here stand I, lady; dart thy skill at me;
	Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
	Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
	Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
	And I will wish thee never more to dance,
	Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
	O! never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
	Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,
	Nor never come in visor to my friend,
	Nor woo in rime, like a blind harper's song,
	Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
	Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation,
	Figures pedantical; these summer flies
	Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
	I do forswear them; and I here protest,
	By this white glove,--how white the hand,
	God knows,--
	Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
	In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
	And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--

	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear

	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither of either; I remit both twain.
	I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
	Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
	To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
	Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
	Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
	That smiles his cheek in years, and knows the trick
	To make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd,
	Told our intents before; which once disclos'd,
	The ladies did change favours, and then we,
	Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
	Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
	We are again forsworn, in will and error.
	Much upon this it is

	And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
	Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
	You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
	Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
	You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
	Wounds like a leaden sword.

<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, not so: I do beseech you, stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
	For all your fair endeavours; and entreat,
	Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
	In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
	The liberal opposition of our spirits,
	If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
	In the converse of breath; your gentleness
	Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord!
	A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue,
	Excuse me so, coming so short of thanks
	For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The extreme part of time extremely forms
	All causes to the purpose of his speed,
	And often, at his very loose, decides
	That which long process could not arbitrate:
	And though the mourning brow of progeny
	Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
	The holy suit which fain it would convince;
	Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
	Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
	From what it purpos'd; since, to wail friends lost
	Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
	As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you not: my griefs are double.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
	And by these badges understand the king.
	For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
	Play'd foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies,
	Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
	Even to the opposed end of our intents;
	And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
	As love is full of unbefitting strains;
	All wanton as a child, skipping and vain;
	Form'd by the eye, and, therefore, like the eye,
	Full of stray shapes, of habits and of forms,
	Varying in subjects, as the eye doth roll
	To every varied object in his glance:
	Which parti-coated presence of loose love
	Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
	Have misbecome our oaths and gravities,
	Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
	Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
	Our love being yours, the error that love makes
	Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
	By being once false for ever to be true
	To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
	And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
	Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have receiv'd your letters full of love;
	Your favours, the embassadors of love;
	And, in our maiden council, rated them
	At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,
	As bombast and as lining to the time.
	But more devout than this in our respects
	Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
	In their own fashion, like a merriment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<DUMAINE>

	Grant us your loves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A time, methinks, too short
	To make a world-without-end bargain in.
	No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjur'd much,
	Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
	If for my love,--as there is no such cause,--
	You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
	Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
	To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
	Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
	There stay, until the twelve celestial signs
	Have brought about their annual reckoning.
	If this austere insociable life
	Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
	If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,
	Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
	But that it bear this trial and last love;
	Then, at the expiration of the year,
	Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
	And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
	I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut
	My woful self up in a mourning house,
	Raining the tears of lamentation
	For the remembrance of my father's death.
	If this thou do deny, let our hands part;
	Neither intitled in the other's heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this, or more than this, I would deny,
	To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
	The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
	Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.

	You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd:

</BEROWNE>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
	Before I saw you, and the world's large tongue
	Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks;
	Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
	Which you on all estates will execute
	That lie within the mercy of your wit:
	To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
	And therewithal to win me, if you please,--
	Without the which I am not to be won,--
	You shall this twelvemonth term, from day to day,
	Visit the speechless sick, and still converse
	With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
	With all the fierce endeavour of your wit
	To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALINE>
<BEROWNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
	It cannot be; it is impossible:
	Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEROWNE>
<ROSALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
	Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
	Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
	A jest's prosperity lics in the ear
	Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
	Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
	Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
	Will hear your idle scorns, continue them,
	And I will have you and that fault withal;
	But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
	And I shall find you empty of that fault,
	Right joyful of your reformation.

	When daisies pied and violets blue
	And lady-smocks all silver-white
	And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
	Do paint the meadows with delight,
	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
	Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
	Cuckoo,
	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O, word of fear,
	Unpleasing to a married ear!
	II.
	When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
	And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
	When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
	And maidens bleach their summer smocks,
	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
	Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
	Cuckoo;
	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O, word of fear,
	Unpleasing to a married ear!
	WINTER.
	III.
	When icicles hang by the wall,
	And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
	And Tom bears logs into the hall,
	And milk comes frozen home in pail,
	When blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul,
	Then nightly sings the staring owl,
	Tu-who;
	Tu-whit, tu-who--a merry note,
	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
	IV
	When all aloud the wind doth blow,
	And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
	And birds sit brooding in the snow,
	And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
	When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
	Then nightly sings the staring owl,
	Tu-who;
	Tu-whit, tu-who--a merry note,
	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
