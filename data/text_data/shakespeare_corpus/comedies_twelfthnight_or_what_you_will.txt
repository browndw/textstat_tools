<DIRECTION>
Scene.--A City in Illyria; and the Sea-coast near it.
</DIRECTION>
<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
A Room in the Duke's Palace. Enter Duke, Curio, Lords; Musicians attending.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If music be the food of love, play on;
	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
	The appetite may sicken, and so die.
	That strain again! it had a dying fall:
	O! it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
	That breathes upon a bank of violets,
	Stealing and giving odour. Enough! no more:
	'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
	O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
	That, notwithstanding thy capacity
	Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
	Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
	But falls into abatement and low price,
	Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy,
	That it alone is high fantastical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<CURIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you go hunt, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURIO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Curio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<CURIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURIO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
	O! when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
	Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence.
	That instant was I turn'd into a hart,
	And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
	E'er since pursue me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Valentine.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now! what news from her?
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
	But from her handmaid do return this answer:
	The element itself, till seven years' heat,
	Shall not behold her face at ample view;
	But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk,
	And water once a day her chamber round
	With eve-offending brine: all this, to season
	A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
	And lasting in her sad remembrance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! she that hath a heart of that fine frame
	To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
	How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
	Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
	That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
	Her sweet perfections with one self king.
	Away before me to sweet beds of flowers;
	Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Sea-coast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Viola, Captain, and Sailors.
</DIRECTION>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What country, friends, is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Illyria, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what should I do in Illyria?
	My brother he is in Elysium.
	Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you sailors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is perchance that you yourself were sav'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
	Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
	When you and those poor number sav'd with you
	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
	Most provident in peril, bind himself,--
	Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,--
	To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;
	Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
	So long as I could see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For saying so there's gold.
	Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
	Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
	The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
	Not three hours' travel from this very place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who governs here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A noble duke, in nature as in name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orsino.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
	He was a bachelor then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so is now, or was so very late;
	For but a month ago I went from hence,
	And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
	What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
	That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
	That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her
	In the protection of his son, her brother,
	Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
	They say she hath abjur'd the company
	And sight of men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! that I serv'd that lady,
	And might not be deliver'd to the world,
	Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
	What my estate is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That were hard to compass,
	Because she will admit no kind of suit,
	No, not the duke's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;
	And though that nature with a beauteous wall
	Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
	I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
	With this thy fair and outward character.
	I prithee,--and I'll pay thee bounteously,--
	Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
	For such disguise as haply shall become
	The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
	Thou shalt present me as a eunuch to him:
	It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
	And speak to him in many sorts of music
	That will allow me very worth his service.
	What else may hap to time I will commit;
	Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
	When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank thee: lead me on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.

</SCENE_2>
<SCENE_3>
<DIRECTION>
A Room in Olivia's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria.
</DIRECTION>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, let her except before excepted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too: an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that to the purpose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats: he's a very fool and a prodigal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He's a coward and a coystril, that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek.
</DIRECTION>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet Sir Andrew!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bless you, fair shrew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you too, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My niece's chambermaid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Mary, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mistake, knight: 'accost' is, front her, board her, woo her, assail her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of 'accost?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fare you well, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An thou let her part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I have not you by the hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore, sweetheart? what's your metaphor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's dry, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dry jest, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you full of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O knight! thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I see thee so put down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An I thought that, I'd forswear it.
	I'll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pourquoi, my dear knight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is 'pourquoi?' do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O! had I but followed the arts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, would that have mended my hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me. The count himself here hard by woos her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll none o' the count; she'll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear it. Tut, there's life in't, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art thou good at these kickchawses, knight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters: and yet I will not compare with an old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I can cut a caper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I can cut the mutton to't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig: I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taurus! that's sides and heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.

<SCENE_4>
<DIRECTION>
A Room in the Duke's Palace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Valentine, and Viola in man's attire.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<VALENTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you. Here comes the count.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Duke, Curio, and Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who saw Cesario? ho!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your attendance, my lord; here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,
	Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
	To thee the book even of my secret soul:
	Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,
	Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
	And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
	Till thou have audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, my noble lord,
	If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
	As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
	Rather than make unprofited return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! then unfold the passion of my love;
	Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
	It shall become thee well to act my woes;
	She will attend it better in thy youth
	Than in a nuncio of more grave aspect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think not so, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear lad, believe it;
	For they shall yet belie thy happy years
	That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
	Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
	Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound;
	And all is semblative a woman's part.
	I know thy constellation is right apt
	For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
	All, if you will; for I myself am best
	When least in company. Prosper well in this,
	And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
	To call his fortunes thine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do my best
	To woo your lady

<DIRECTION>
A Room in Olivia's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Maria and Clown.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make that good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He shall see none to fear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that saying was born, of, 'I fear no colours.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where, good Mistress Mary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or, to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are resolute then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break, your gaskins fall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way: if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.

	Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus? 'Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.'

	Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you grow dishonest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing that's mended is but patched: virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.

</CLOWN>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I bade them take away you.

</OLIVIA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.

	What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him: infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALVOLIO>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool.

</CLOWN>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How say you to that, Malvolio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools' zanies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALVOLIO>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.

	Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick: he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep: he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified against any denial.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Of what personage and years is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly: one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
	Your will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,--I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whence came you, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can say little more than I have studied, and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.

	Are you a comedian?

</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I do not usurp myself, I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for, what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maiden-head; to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.

<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

	O! sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as Item, Two lips, indifferent red; Item, Two grey eyes, with lids to them; Item, One neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?

	In voices well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant;
	And, in dimension and the shape of nature
	A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him:

	By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.

<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore, it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that; for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.

	Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be so returned: if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.

	I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
	Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
	She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
	That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
	For she did speak in starts distractedly.
	She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
	Invites me in this churlish messenger.
	None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
	I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
	Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
	Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
	Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
	How easy is it for the proper-false
	In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
	Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we!
	For such as we are made of, such we be.
	How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly;
	And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
	And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
	What will become of this? As I am man,
	My state is desperate for my master's love;
	As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
	What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
	O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
	It is too hard a knot for me to untie.

<AGUECHEEK>

	Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know, to be up late is to be up late.

</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the four elements?

	By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman: hadst it?

	Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night: since the youth of the count's was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet.

	The devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass, that cons state without book, and utters it by great swarths: the best persuaded of himself; so crammed, as he thinks, with excellences, that it is his ground of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.

I can write very like my lady your niece; on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.

	Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take

	My part of death, no one so true
	Did share it.
	Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
	On my black coffin let there be strown,

	Alas! their love may be call'd appetite,
	No motion of the liver, but the palate,
	That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;

	And what's her history?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
	But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
	Feed on her damask cheek: she pin'd in thought,
	And with a green and yellow melancholy,
	She sat like Patience on a monument,
	Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
	We men may say more, swear more; but indeed
	Our shows are more than will, for still we prove
	Much in our vows, but little in our love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<VIOLA>

	I am all the daughters of my father's house,

	Sir, shall I to this lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, that's the theme.

	Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.

	Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?

<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio's coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half-hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there

<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me; and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think on't?

</MALVOLIO>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's an over-weening rogue!

	Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state,--

	O! for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!

</MALVOLIO>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bolts and shackles!

</BELCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, peace, peace, peace! now, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while; and perchance wind up my watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me,--

<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall this fellow live?

<FABIAN>

	Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace!

	And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?

Reads.

	To the unknown beloved, this and my good wishes: her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?

	Jove knows I love;

	Excellent wench, say I.

	'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.

	What dish o' poison has she dressed him!

</BELCH>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity; there is no obstruction in this. And the end, what should that alphabetical position portend? if I could make that resemble something in me,--Softly!--M, O, A, I,--

	O! ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.

	M,--But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under probation: A should follow, but O does.

<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And O shall end, I hope.

</FABIAN>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry, O!

	And then I comes behind.

</MALVOLIO>
<FABIAN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former; and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft! here follows prose.
	If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Thy Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them; and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough, and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee. THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.
	Daylight and champian discovers not more: this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and, with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript.
	Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.
	Jove, I thank thee. I will smile: I will do everything that thou wilt have me.

	If you will, then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady; he will come to her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she abhors; and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt.

	Art thou a churchman?

</VIOLA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLOWN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.

</VIOLA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have said, sir. To see this age!
	A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!

</CLOWN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that's certain: they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.

<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CLOWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy reason, man?

	Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.

</CLOWN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and carest for nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<CLOWN>

	Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.

	Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

	No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings--the husband's the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.

	The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin; I might say 'element,' but the word is overworn.

Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fellow's wise enough to play the fool,
	And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
	He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
	The quality of persons, and the time,
	And, like the haggard, check at every feather
	That comes before his eye. This is a practice
	As full of labour as a wise man's art;
	For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
	But wise men folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

	Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
	Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment.
	You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
	Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
	Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
	On his behalf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! by your leave, I pray you,
	I bade you never speak again of him:
	But, would you undertake another suit,
	I had rather hear you to solicit that
	Than music from the spheres.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear lady,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
	After the last enchantment you did here,
	A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
	Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you:
	Under your hard construction must I sit,
	To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
	Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
	Have you not set mine honour at the stake,
	And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
	That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
	Enough is shown; a cypress, not a bosom,
	Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pity you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a degree to love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof
	That very oft we pity enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then methinks 'tis time to smile again.
	O world! how apt the poor are to be proud.
	If one should be a prey, how much the better
	To fall before the lion than the wolf
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Clock strikes.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
	Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
	And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
	Your wife is like to reap a proper man:
	There lies your way, due west.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then westward-ho!
	Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!
	You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay:
	I prithee, tell me what thou think'st of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you do think you are not what you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I think so, I think the same of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then think you right: I am not what I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would you were as I would have you be!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it be better, madam, than I am?
	I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
	In the contempt and anger of his lip.
	A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
	Than love that would seem hid; love's night is noon.
	Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
	By maidhood, honour, truth, and every thing,
	I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
	Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
	Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
	For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;
	But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
	Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
	I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
	And that no woman has; nor never none
	Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
	And so adieu, good madam: never more
	Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move
	That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

Enter Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and Fabian.
</DIRECTION>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy reason, dear venom; give thy reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me; I saw't i' the orchard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As plain as I see you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Slight! will you make an ass o' me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart, and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, firenew from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour: challenge me the count's youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGUECHEEK>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent, and full of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink: if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.

<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where shall I find you?

<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby.

</FABIAN>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shall have a rare letter from him; but you'll not deliver it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<FABIAN>

	And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.

<DIRECTION>
Enter Maria.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And cross-gartered?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church. I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his face into more lines than are in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as 'tis; I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do, he'll smile and take't for a great favour.

Enter Sebastian and Antonio.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not by my will have troubled you;
	But since you make your pleasure of your pains,
	I will no further chide you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could not stay behind you: my desire,
	More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
	And not all love to see you,--though so much
	As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,--
	But jealousy what might befall your travel,
	Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
	Unguided and unfriended, often prove
	Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
	The rather by these arguments of fear,
	Set forth in your pursuit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My kind Antonio,
	I can no other answer make but thanks,
	And thanks, and ever thanks; for oft good turns
	Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
	But, were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,
	You should find better dealing. What's to do?
	Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
	I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
	With the memorials and the things of fame
	That do renown this city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you'd pardon me;
	I do not without danger walk these streets:
	Once, in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his galleys,
	I did some service; of such note indeed,
	That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Belike you slew great number of his people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The offence is not of such a bloody nature,
	Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
	Might well have given us bloody argument.
	It might have since been answer'd in repaying
	What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
	Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
	For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
	I shall pay dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not then walk too open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doth not fit me. Hold, sir; here's my purse.
	In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
	Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
	Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
	With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why I your purse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
	You have desire to purchase; and your store,
	I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you for an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>

Enter Olivia and Maria.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
	How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
	For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
	I speak too loud.
	Where is Malvolio? he is sad, and civil,
	And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
	Where is Malvolio?

</OLIVIA>
<MARIA>

	He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is sure possess'd, madam.

<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<MARIA>

	No, madam; he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in's wits.

	Smil'st thou?
	I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVIA>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this crossgartering; but what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one and please all.'

	Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?

Exeunt Olivia and Maria.
</DIRECTION>
<MALVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity;' and consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this fellow be looked to;' fellow! not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but fellow. Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, we'll have him in a dark room, and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see.

	Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.

	Good, and valiant.

<FABIAN>

	Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.

</MARIA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest him, draw; and, as thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away!

<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour; and drive the gentleman,--as I know his youth will aptly receive it,--into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.

<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentleman, God save thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mistake, sir: I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, sir, what is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word: give't or take't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady: I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury: therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

	I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight; I care not who knows so much of my mettle

Re-enter Sir Toby, with Sir Andrew.
</DIRECTION>
<BELCH>

	Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.

	Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.

</BELCH>
<AGUECHEEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plague on't; an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.

	I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.

	He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BELCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for his oath's sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw for the supportance of his vow: he protests he will not hurt you.

</FABIAN>
<BELCH>

	Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy: the gentleman will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to't.

<ANTONIO>

<DIRECTION>
To Viola.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This comes with seeking you:
	But there's no remedy: I shall answer it.
	What will you do, now my necessity
	Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
	Much more for what I cannot do for you
	Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz'd:
	But be of comfort.

<OFFICER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, sir, away.

</ANTONIO>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What money, sir?
	For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
	And part, being prompted by your present trouble,
	Out of my lean and low ability
	I'll lend you something: my having is not much:
	I'll make division of my present with you.
	Hold, there is half my coffer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIOLA>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you deny me now?
	Is't possible that my deserts to you
	Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
	Lest that it make me so unsound a man
	As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
	That I have done for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<VIOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know of none;
	Nor know I you by voice or any feature.

</OFFICER_2>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
	I snatch'd one-half out of the jaws of death,
	Reliev'd him with such sanctity of love,
	And to his image, which methought did promise
	Most venerable worth, did I devotion.

	What's that to us? The time goes by: away!

<ANTONIO>

	But O! how vile an idol proves this god.
	Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
	In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
	None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
	Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
	Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.

	Well, I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in't: and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student; but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar.

	This is the air; that is the glorious sun; This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
	And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
	Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio then?
	I could not find him at the Elephant;
	Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,
	That he did range the town to seek me out.
	His counsel now might do me golden service;
	For though my soul disputes well with my sense
	That this may be some error, but no madness,
	Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
	So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
	That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,
	And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
	To any other trust but that I am mad
	Or else the lady's mad: yet, if 'twere so,
	She could not sway her house, command her followers,
	Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
	With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
	As I perceive she does. There's something in't
	That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.

	That my most jealous and too doubtful soul

	Orsino, noble sir,
	Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me:
	Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,

	Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
	That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
	From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
	Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was:
	His life I gave him, and did thereto add
	My love, without retention or restraint,
	All his in dedication; for his sake
	Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
	Into the danger of this adverse town;
	Drew to defend him when he was beset:
	Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
	Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
	Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
	And grew a twenty years removed thing
	While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,
	Which I had recommended to his use
	Not half an hour before.

	By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it: though you have put me into darkness, and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship.

	Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.
	You must not now deny it is your hand:
	Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase,
	Or say 'tis not your seal nor your invention:
	You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,
	And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
	Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
	Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
	To put on yellow stockings, and to frown
	Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
	And, acting this in an obedient hope,
	Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
	Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
	And made the most notorious geck and gull
	That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALVOLIO>
<OLIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! Malvolio, this is not my writing,
	Though, I confess, much like the character;
	But, out of question, 'tis Maria's hand:
	And now I do bethink me, it was she
	First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,
	And in such forms which here were presuppos'd
	Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
	This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
	But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
	Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
	Of thine own cause.

	Good madam, hear me speak,

	Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
	Set this device against Malvolio here,
	Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
	We had conceiv'd against him. Maria writ
	The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
	In recompense whereof he hath married her.
	How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
	May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,
	If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
	That have on both sides past.
