	<DIALOGUE>
	To sing a song that old was sung,
	From ashes ancient Gower is come,
	Assuming man's infirmities,
	To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
	It hath been sung at festivals,
	On ember-eves, and holy-ales;
	And lords and ladies in their lives
	Have read it for restoratives:
	The purchase is to make men glorious;
	Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
	If you, born in these latter times,
	When wit's more ripe, accept my rimes,
	And that to hear an old man sing
	May to your wishes pleasure bring,
	I life would wish, and that I might
	Waste it for you like taper-light.
	This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
	Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat,
	The fairest in all Syria,
	I tell you what mine authors say:
	This king unto him took a fere,
	Who died and left a female heir,
	So buxom, blithe, and full of face
	As heaven had lent her all his grace;
	With whom the father liking took,
	And her to incest did provoke.
	Bad child, worse father! to entice his own
	To evil should be done by none.
	By custom what they did begin
	Was with long use account no sin.
	The beauty of this sinful dame
	Made many princes thither frame,
	To seek her as a bed-fellow,
	In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
	Which to prevent, he made a law,
	To keep her still, and men in awe,
	That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
	His riddle told not, lost his life:
	So for her many a wight did die,
	As yon grim looks do testify.
	What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
	I give, my cause who best can justify

	Yon sometime famous princes, like thyself,

	Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
	Nor ask advice of any other thought

	I am no viper, yet I feed
	On mother's flesh which did me breed;
	I sought a husband, in which labour
	I found that kindness in a father.
	He's father, son, and husband mild,
	I mother, wife, and yet his child.
	How they may be, and yet in two,
	As you will live, resolve it you.
	Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers!
	That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
	Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
	If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
	Fair glass of light, I lov'd you, and could still,
	Were not this glorious casket stor'd with ill:
	But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt;
	For he's no man on whom perfections wait
	That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
	You're a fair viol, and your sense the strings,
	Who, finger'd to make men his lawful music,
	Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken;
	But being play'd upon before your time,
	Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
	Good sooth, I care not for you.

	Great king,
	Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
	'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
	Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
	He's more secure to keep it shut than shown;
	For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,
	Blows dust in others' eyes, to spread itself;
	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
	Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
	By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for 't.
	Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;
	And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
	It is enough you know; and it is fit,
	What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
	All love the womb that their first being bred,
	Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.

	Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
	As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:

	If it be true that I interpret false,
	Then were it certain you were not so bad
	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
	Where now you're both a father and a son,
	By your untimely claspings with your child,--
	Which pleasure fits a husband, not a father;--
	And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
	By the defiling of her parent's bed;
	And both like serpents are, who though they feed
	On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
	Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
	Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
	Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
	One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
	Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke.
	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
	Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
	Then, lest my life be cropp'd to keep you clear,
	By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let none disturb us.--
	Why should this change of thoughts,
	The sad companion, dull-ey'd melancholy,
	Be my so us'd a guest, as not an hour
	In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night--
	The tomb where grief should sleep--can breed me quiet?
	Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
	And danger, which I feared, is at Antioch,
	Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here;
	Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
	Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
	Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
	That have their first conception by mis-dread,
	Have after-nourishment and life by care;
	And what was first but fear what might be done,
	Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
	And so with me: the great Antiochus,--
	'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
	Since he's so great can make his will his act,--
	Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
	Nor boots it me to say I honour him,
	If he suspect I may dishonour him;
	And what may make him blush in being known,
	He'll stop the course by which it might be known.
	With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
	And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
	Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
	Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
	And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
	Which care of them, not pity of myself,--
	Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
	Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,--
	Make both my body pine and soul to languish,
	And punish that before that he would punish.

	Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
	Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err:
	When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,

	Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
	That minister'st a potion unto me
	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
	Attend me then: I went to Antioch,
	Where as thou know'st, against the face of death
	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
	From whence an issue I might propagate
	Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
	The rest, hark in thine ear, as black as incest;
	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
	Seem'd not to strike, but smooth; but thou know'st this,
	'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
	Which fear so grew in me I hither fled,
	Under the covering of a careful night,
	Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
	I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
	Decrease not, but grow faster than the years.
	And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
	That I should open to the listening air
	How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
	To lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms,
	And make pretence of wrong that I have done him;
	When all, for mine, if I may call 't, offence,
	Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:

	Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,

	This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
	A city on whom plenty held full hand,
	For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
	Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
	And strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at;
	Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
	Like one another's glass to trim them by:
	Their tables were stor'd full to glad the sight,
	And not so much to feed on as delight;
	All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
	The name of help grew odious to repeat.

	But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
	These mouths, whom but of late earth, sea, and air
	Were all too little to content and please,
	Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
	As houses are defil'd for want of use,
	They are now starv'd for want of exercise;
	Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
	Must have inventions to delight the taste,
	Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it;
	Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
	Thought nought too curious, are ready now
	To eat those little darlings whom they lov'd.
	So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
	Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.
	Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
	Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
	Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
	Is not this true?

	Knights,
	To say you're welcome were superfluous.
	To place upon the volume of your deeds,

	Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
	His queen, with child, makes her desire,--
	Which who shall cross?--along to go;
	Omit we all their dole and woe:
	Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
	And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
	On Neptune's billow; half the flood
	Hath their keel cut: but Fortune's mood
	Varies again; the grisled north
	Disgorges such a tempest forth,
	That, as a duck for life that dives,
	So up and down the poor ship drives.
	The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
	Does fall in travail with her fear;
	And what ensues in this fell storm
	Shall for itself itself perform.
	I nill relate, action may
	Conveniently the rest convey,
	Which might not what by me is told.

	Sir,

	I hold it ever,
	Virtue and cunning were endowments greater

	But immortality attends the former,
	Making a man a god. 'Tis known I ever
	Have studied physic, through which secret art,
	By turning o'er authorities, I have--
	Together with my practice--made familiar
	To me and to my aid the blest infusions
	That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
	And can speak of the disturbances
	That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
	A more content in course of true delight
	Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
	Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
	To please the fool and death.

	Welcom'd and settled to his own desire.
	His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
	Unto Diana there a votaress.
	Now to Marina bend your mind,
	Whom our fast-growing scene must find
	At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
	In music, letters; who hath gain'd
	Of education all the grace,
	Which makes her bath the heart and places
	Of general wonder. But, alack!
	That monster envy, oft the wrack
	Of earned praise, Marina's life
	Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
	And in this kind hath our Cleon
	One daughter, and a wench full grown,
	Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
	Hight Philoten, and it is said
	For certain in our story, she
	Would ever with Marina be:
	Be 't when she weav'd the sleided silk
	With fingers, long, small, white as milk,
	Or when she would with sharp neeld wound
	The cambric, which she made more sound
	By hurting it; when to the lute
	She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
	That still records with moan; or when
	She would with rich and constant pen
	Vail to her mistress Dian; still
	This Philoten contends in skill
	With absolute Marina: so
	With the dove of Paphos might the crow
	Vie feathers white. Marina gets
	All praises, which are paid as debts,
	And not as given. This so darks
	In Philoten all graceful marks,
	That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
	A present murderer does prepare
	For good Marina, that her daughter
	Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
	The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
	Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
	And cursed Dionyza hath
	The pregnant instrument of wrath
	Prest for this blow. The unborn event
	I do commend to your content:
	Only I carry winged time
	Post on the lame feet of my rime;

	A nurse of me. Lord! how your favour's chang'd
	With this unprofitable woe. Come,

	Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,

	Come, come;

	With more than foreign heart. We every day
	Expect him here; when he shall come and find
	Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
	He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
	Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
	No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you;
	Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve

	My father, as nurse said, did never fear,

	I never did her hurt in all my life.
	I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
	To any living creature; believe me, la,
	I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly;
	I trod upon a worm against my will,

	O! our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully, which you commit willingly; to despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers; seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.

	I' the justice of compare. O villain Leonine!
	Whom thou hast poison'd too;

	Becoming well thy fact; what canst thou say
	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEON>
<DIONYZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
	Unless you play the pious innocent,
	And for an honest attribute cry out
	'She died by foul play.'

<DIONYZA>

	Be one of those that think

<DIONYZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be it so, then;
	Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
	She did distain my child, and stood between
	Her and her fortunes; none would look on her,
	But cast their gazes on Marina's face,
	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
	Not worth the time of day. It pierc'd me thorough;
	And though you call my course unnatural,
	You not your child well loving, yet I find
	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
	Perform'd to your sole daughter.

	And as for Pericles,
	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,

	In glittering golden characters express
	A general praise to her, and care in us
	At whose expense 'tis done.

	By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
	To use one language in each several clime
	Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
	To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
	The stages of our story. Pericles
	Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
	Attended on by many a lord and knight,
	To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
	Old Helicanus goes along. Behind
	Is left to govern it, you bear in mind,
	Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
	Advanc'd in time to great and high estate.
	Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
	This king to Tarsus, think his pilot thought,
	So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,
	To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
	Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
	Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.

	This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
	And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
	With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,
	Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
	Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs;
	He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
	A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
	And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit

	But to have divinity preached there! did you ever dream of such a thing?

<PANDAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne'er come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDAR>
<BAWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, fie upon her! she is able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation; we must either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master-reasons, her prayers, her knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil if he should cheapen a kiss of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAWD>
<BOULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers, and make all our swearers priests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOULT>
<PANDAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANDAR>
<BAWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, there's no way to be rid on 't but by the way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus, disguised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAWD>
<BOULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers.

	Now, the gods to-bless your honour!

	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad to see your honour in good health.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOULT>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may so; 'tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs. How now! wholesome iniquity, have you that a man may deal withal, and defy the surgeon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSIMACHUS>
<BAWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never came her like in Mitylene.

	If she'd do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.

	Well; call forth, call forth.

<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, prithee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSIMACHUS>
<BOULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! sir, I can be modest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOULT>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSIMACHUS>
<BAWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beseech your honour, give me leave; a word, and I'll have done presently.

	First, I would have you note, this is an honourable man.

<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<BAWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man whom I am bound to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAWD>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how honourable he is in that I know not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<BAWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAWD>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha' you done?

	My lord, she's not paced yet; you must take some pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will leave his honour and her together.

	Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?

</LYSIMACHUS>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What trade, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, I cannot name 't but I shall offend.

	I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.

<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	E'er since I can remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<LYSIMACHUS>

	Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at five or at seven?

</LYSIMACHUS>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYSIMACHUS>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will come into 't? I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?

<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is my principal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINA>
<LYSIMACHUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. O! you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place; come, come.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not think
	Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.

	Hold, here's more gold for thee.
	A curse upon him, die he like a thief,

</BOULT>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
	Since they do better thee in their command.
	Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
	Of hell would not in reputation change;
	Thou art the damned door-keeper to every
	Coystril that comes inquiring for his Tib,
	To the choleric fisting of every rogue
	Thy ear is liable, thy food is such
	As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.

</BOULT>
<MARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty.
	Old receptacles, or common sewers, of filth;

	Would own a name too dear. O! that the gods

	Here, here's gold for thee.
	If that thy master would gain by me,
	Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
	With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast;

	I doubt not but this populous city will
	Yield many scholars.

	Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.

	Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
	Into an honest house, our story says.
	She sings like one immortal, and she dances

	Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her neeld composes
	Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
	That even her art sisters the natural roses;
	Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry;
	That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
	Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
	She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
	And to her father turn our thoughts again,
	Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
	Whence, driven before the winds, he is arriv'd
	Here where his daughter dwells: and on this coast
	Suppose him now at anchor. The city striv'd
	God Neptune's annual feast to keep; from whence
	Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
	His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
	And to him in his barge with fervour hies.
	In your supposing once more put your sight

	Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark

	O! sir, a courtesy,

	I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,

	My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one

	As silver-voic'd; her eyes as jewel-like,

	Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child,

	That him and his they in his palace burn:
