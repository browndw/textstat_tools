</DIRECTION>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder how the king escap'd our hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north,
	He slily stole away and left his men:
	Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
	Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
	Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
	Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
	Charg'd our main battle's front, and breaking in
	Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
	Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
	I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
	That this is true, father, behold his blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Showing his bloody sword.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTGOMERY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood

	Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

<RICHARD>

</RICHARD>

Throwing down the Duke of Somerset's head.

<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.
	But, is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?

</YORK>
<NORFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORFOLK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
	Before I see thee seated in that throne
	Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
	I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
	This is the palace of the fearful king,
	And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
	For this is thine, and not King Henry's heirs'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
	For hither we have broken in by force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<NORFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORFOLK>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;
	And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when the king comes, offer him no violence,
	Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

</WARWICK>
<DIRECTION>
The Soldiers retire.
</DIRECTION>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The queen this day here holds her parliament,
	But little thinks we shall be of her council:
	By words or blows here let us win our right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
	Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
	And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice
	Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
	I mean to take possession of my right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
	The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
	Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.
	I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
	Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown

</DIRECTION>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
	Even in the chair of state! belike he means--
	Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer--
	To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
	Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,
	And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
	On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!

</NORTHUMBERLAND>
<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIFFORD>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
	My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
	He durst not sit there had your father liv'd.
	My gracious lord, here in the parliament
	Let us assail the family of York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIFFORD>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
	To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
	Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats,
	Shall be the war that Henry means to use
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They advance to the Duke.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,

</K_HENRY>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am thine.

</YORK>
<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For shame! come down: he made thee Duke of York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
	In following this usurping Henry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whom should he follow but his natural king?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIFFORD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, Clifford; and that's Richard, Duke of York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must and shall be so: content thyself.

</YORK>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be Duke of Lancaster: let him be king.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
	And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
	That we are those which chas'd you from the field
	And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
	March'd through the city to the palace gates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
	And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORTHUMBERLAND>
<WESTMORELAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
	Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I'll have more lives
	Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WESTMORELAND>
<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Urge it no more; lest that instead of words,
	I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
	As shall revenge his death before I stir.

</CLIFFORD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you we show our title to the crown?
	If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
	Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
	Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March;
	I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
	Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,
	And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
	When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
	Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.

<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
	And be you silent and attentive too,
	For he that interrupts him shall not live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
	Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
	No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
	Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
	And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
	Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
	My title's good, and better far than his.

	Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An if he may, then am I lawful king;
	For Richard, in the view of many lords,
	Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
	Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He rose against him, being his sovereign,
	And made him to resign his crown perforce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
	Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; for he could not so resign his crown
	But that the next heir should succeed and reign.

<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depos'd he shall be in despite of all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<NORTHUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art deceiv'd: 'tis not thy southern power,

	Who can be patient in such extremes?
	Ah! wretched man; would I had died a maid,

	Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father.
	Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus?
	Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I,
	Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
	Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
	Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
	Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir,
	And disinherited thine only son.

	Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son;
	The Earl of Warwick, and the duke, enforc'd me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<Q_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enforc'd thee! art thou king, and wilt be forc'd?
	I shame to hear thee speak. Ah! timorous wretch;
	Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me;
	And given unto the house of York such head
	As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
	To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
	What is it but to make thy sepulchre,
	And creep into it far before thy time?
	Warwick is chancellor and the Lord of Calais;
	Stern Faulconbridge commands the narrow seas;
	The duke is made protector of the realm;
	And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
	The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
	Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
	The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
	Before I would have granted to that act;
	But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
	And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself,
	Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
	Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
	Whereby my son is disinherited.
	The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
	Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
	And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace,
	And utter ruin of the house of York.
	Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
	Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.

	An oath is of no moment, being not took

	That hath authority over him that swears:
	Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
	Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
	Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
	Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
	How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,
	Within whose circuit is Elysium,
	And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
	Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest

	Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
	Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
	My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
	But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
	Like men born to renown by life or death.
	Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
	And thrice cried, 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
	And full as oft came Edward to my side,
	With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
	In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
	And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
	Richard cried, 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
	And cried, 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
	A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
	With this, we charg'd again; but, out, alas!

	Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
	Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
	That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
	Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
	What! was it you that would be England's king?
	Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
	And made a preachment of your high descent?
	Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
	The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
	And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
	Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
	Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
	Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
	Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
	That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point
	Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
	And if thine eyes can water for his death,
	I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
	Alas, poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
	I should lament thy miserable state.
	I prithee grieve, to make me merry, York.
	What! hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
	That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
	Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
	And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
	Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
	Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
	York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.
	A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
	Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on

	Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
	Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair;

	But how is it that great Plantagenet
	Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
	As I bethink me, you should not be king
	Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
	And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
	And rob his temples of the diadem,
	Now in his life, against your holy oath?
	O! 'tis a fault too-too unpardonable.
	Off with the crown; and, with the crown, his head;
	And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.

<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
	Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
	How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
	To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
	Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
	But that thy face is, visor-like, unchanging,
	Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
	I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush:
	To tell thee whence thou cam'st, of whom deriv'd,
	Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
	Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
	Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem;
	Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
	Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
	It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
	Unless the adage must be verified,
	That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
	'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
	But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
	'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;
	The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
	'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
	The want thereof makes thee abominable.
	Thou art as opposite to every good
	As the Antipodes are unto us,
	Or as the south to the septentrion.
	O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide!
	How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
	To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
	And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
	Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;
	Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
	Bidd'st thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
	Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will;
	For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
	And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
	These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies,
	And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
	'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman.

	See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
	This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
	And I with tears do wash the blood away.

	As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
	Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
	Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
	The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.
	So far'd our father with his enemies;
	So fled his enemies my war-like father:
	Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.

	Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Environed he was with many foes,
	And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
	Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
	But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
	And many strokes, though with a little axe,
	Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
	By many hands your father was subdu'd;
	But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
	Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
	Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite;
	Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
	The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks,
	A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
	Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
	And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
	They took his head, and on the gates of York
	They set the same; and there it doth remain,
	The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet Duke of York! our prop to lean upon,
	Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay!
	O Clifford! boist'rous Clifford! thou hast slain
	The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
	And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
	For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
	Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
	Ah! would she break from hence, that this my body
	Might in the ground be closed up in rest,
	For never henceforth shall I joy again,
	Never, O! never, shall I see more joy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
	Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
	Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden;
	For self-same wind, that I should speak withal
	Is kindling coals that fire all my breast,
	And burn me up with flames, that tears would quench.
	To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
	Tears then, for babes; blows and revenge for me!
	Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
	Or die renowned by attempting it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<EDWARD>

	His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
	His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

	Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,

	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
	Our baleful news, and at each word's deliv'rance
	Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
	The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
	O valiant lord! the Duke of York is slain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Warwick! Warwick! that Plantagenet
	Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption,
	Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears,
	And now, to add more measure to your woes,
	I come to tell you things sith then befallen.
	After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
	Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp,
	Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
	Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
	I, then in London, keeper of the king,
	Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
	And very well appointed, as I thought,
	March'd towards Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
	Bearing the king in my behalf along;
	For by my scouts I was advertised
	That she was coming with a full intent
	To dash our late decree in parliament,
	Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
	Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met,
	Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
	But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
	Who look'd full gently on his war-like queen,
	That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
	Or whether 'twas report of her success;
	Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
	Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
	I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,
	Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
	Our soldiers'--like the night-owl's lazy flight,
	Or like a lazy thresher with a flail--
	Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
	I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
	With promise of high pay, and great rewards:
	But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
	And we in them no hope to win the day;
	So that we fled: the king unto the queen;
	Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,
	In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;
	For in the marches here we heard you were,
	Making another head to fight again.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
	And when came George from Burgundy to England?

</EDWARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
	And for your brother, he was lately sent
	From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
	With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
	Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
	But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
	For thou shalt know, this strong right hand of mine
	Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
	And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
	Were he as famous, and as bold in war
	As he is fam'd for mildness, peace, and prayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
	'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
	But, in this troublous time what's to be done?
	Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
	And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
	Numb'ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?
	Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
	Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
	If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
	And therefore comes my brother Montague.
	Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
	With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
	And of their feather many more proud birds,
	Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
	He swore consent to your succession,
	His oath enrolled in the parliament;
	And now to London all the crew are gone,
	To frustrate both his oath and what beside
	May make against the house of Lancaster.
	Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
	Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
	With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
	Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
	Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
	Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
	And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
	And once again cry, 'Charge upon our foes!'
	But never once again turn back and fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
	Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
	That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
	And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
	Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
	The next degree is England's royal throne;
	For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
	In every borough as we pass along;
	And he that throws not up his cap for joy
	Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
	King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
	Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,
	But sound the trumpets, and about our task.

</WARWICK>
<RICHARD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My gracious liege, this too much lenity
	And harmful pity must be laid aside.
	To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
	Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
	Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
	Not his that spoils her young before her face.
	Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
	Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
	The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
	And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
	Ambitious York did level at thy crown;
	Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
	He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
	And raise his issue like a loving sire;
	Thou, being a king, bless'd with a goodly son,
	Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
	Which argu'd thee a most unloving father.
	Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
	And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
	Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
	Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
	Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight,
	Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
	Offering their own lives in their young's defence?
	For shame, my liege! make them your precedent.
	Were it not pity that this goodly boy
	Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
	And long hereafter say unto his child,
	'What my great grandfather and grandsire got,
	My careless father fondly gave away?'
	Ah! what a shame were this. Look on the boy;
	And let his manly face, which promiseth
	Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
	To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
	Inferring arguments of mighty force.
	But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
	That things ill got had ever bad success?
	And happy always was it for that son
	Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
	I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
	And would my father had left me no more!
	For all the rest is held at such a rate
	As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
	Than in possession any jot of pleasure.
	Ah! cousin York, would thy best friends did know
	How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!

	A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,

	Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
	Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
	And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
	By that false woman as this king by thee.
	His father revell'd in the heart of France,
	And tam'd the king, and made the Dauphin stoop;
	And had he match'd according to his state,
	He might have kept that glory to this day;
	But when he took a beggar to his bed,
	And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,
	Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
	That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
	And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
	For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
	Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept,
	And we, in pity of the gentle king,
	Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This battle fares like to the morning's war,
	When dying clouds contend with growing light,
	What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
	Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
	Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
	Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
	Now sways it that way, like the self-same sea
	Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind:
	Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
	Now one the better, then another best;
	Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
	Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
	So is the equal poise of this fell war.
	Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
	To whom God will, there be the victory!
	For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
	Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
	They prosper best of all when I am thence.
	Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
	For what is in this world but grief and woe?
	O God! methinks it were a happy life,
	To be no better than a homely swain;
	To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
	To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
	Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
	How many make the hour full complete;
	How many hours bring about the day;
	How many days will finish up the year;
	How many years a mortal man may live.
	When this is known, then to divide the times:
	So many hours must I tend my flock;
	So many hours must I take my rest;
	So many hours must I contemplate;
	So many hours must I sport myself;
	So many days my ewes have been with young;
	So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean;
	So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
	So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
	Pass'd over to the end they were created,
	Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
	Ah! what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
	Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
	To shepherds, looking on their silly sheep,
	Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
	To kings, that fear their subjects' treachery?
	O, yes! it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
	And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
	His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
	His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
	All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
	Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
	His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
	His body couched in a curious bed,
	When care, mistrust, and treason wait on him.

	Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
	This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
	May be possessed with some store of crowns;
	And I, that haply take them from him now,
	May yet ere night yield both my life and them
	To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
	Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
	Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
	O heavy times, begetting such events!
	From London by the king was I press'd forth;
	My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
	Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
	And I, who at his hands receiv'd my life,
	Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
	Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
	And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
	My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
	And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.

	Ah! boy, if any life be left in thee,
	Throw up thine eye: see, see! what showers arise,
	Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
	Upon thy wounds, that kill mine eye and heart.
	O! pity, God, this miserable age.
	What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
	Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural,
	This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
	O boy! thy father gave thee life too soon,
	And hath bereft thee of thy life too late.

	Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!

	The red rose and the white are on his face,
	The fatal colours of our striving houses:

<CLIFFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
	Which, while it lasted, gave King Henry light.
	O Lancaster! I fear thy overthrow
	More than my body's parting with my soul.
	My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
	And, now I fall, thy tough commixtures melt,
	Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York:
	The common people swarm like summer flies;
	And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
	And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
	O Phoebus! hadst thou never given consent
	That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
	Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth;
	And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
	Or as thy father and his father did,
	Giving no ground unto the house of York,
	They never then had sprung like summer flies;
	I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
	Had left no mourning widows for our death,
	And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
	For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
	And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
	Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
	No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
	The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
	For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
	The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
	And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
	Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
	I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast

</WARWICK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! would he did; and so perhaps he doth:

	What! not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
	When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
	I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
	If this right hand would buy two hours' life,
	That I in all despite might rail at him,
	This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood
	Stifle the villain whose unstaunched thirst
	York and young Rutland could not satisfy.

</RICHARD>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
	And rear it in the place your father's stands.
	And now to London with triumphant march,
	There to be crowned England's royal king:
	From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
	And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.
	So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
	And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
	The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
	For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
	Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
	First will I see the coronation;
	And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
	To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

	Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;

	<DIALOGUE>
	My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
	And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
	Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
	To wife for Edward. If this news be true,
	Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
	For Warwick is a subtle orator,
	And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
	By this account then Margaret may win him,
	For she's a woman to be pitied much:
	Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
	Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
	The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
	And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
	To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
	Ay, but she's come to beg; Warwick, to give:
	She on his left side craving aid for Henry;
	He on his right asking a wife for Edward.
	She weeps, and says her Henry is depos'd;
	He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
	That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more:
	Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
	Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
	And in conclusion wins the king from her,
	With promise of his sister, and what else,
	To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
	O Margaret! thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
	Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn.

	Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
	And yielding to another when it blows,
	Commanded always by the greater gust;
	Such is the lightness of you common men.
	But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
	My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.

	Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
	This lady's husband, Sir John Grey, was slain,
	His lands then seiz'd on by the conqueror:
	Her suit is now, to repossess those lands;
	Which we in justice cannot well deny,
	Because in quarrel of the house of York
	The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
	Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,
	That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
	To cross me from the golden time I look for!
	And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
	The lustful Edward's title buried,--
	Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
	And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
	To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
	A cold premeditation for my purpose!
	Why then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
	Like one that stands upon a promontory,
	And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
	Wishing his foot were equal with his eye;
	And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
	Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
	So do I wish the crown, being so far off,
	And so I chide the means that keep me from it,
	And so I say I'll cut the causes off,
	Flattering me with impossibilities.
	My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
	Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
	Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
	What other pleasure can the world afford?
	I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
	And deck my body in gay ornaments,
	And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
	O miserable thought! and more unlikely
	Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.
	Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
	And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
	She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
	To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
	To make an envious mountain on my back,
	Where sits deformity to mock my body;
	To shape my legs of an unequal size;
	To disproportion me in every part,
	Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
	That carries no impression like the dam.
	And am I then a man to be belov'd?
	O monstrous fault! to harbour such a thought.
	Then, since this earth affords no joy to me
	But to command, to check, to o'erbear such
	As are of better person than myself,
	I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown;
	And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
	Until my mis-shap'd trunk that bears this head
	Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
	And yet I know not how to get the crown,
	For many lives stand between me and home:
	And I, like one lost in a thorny wood,
	That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
	Seeking a way and straying from the way;
	Not knowing how to find the open air,
	But toiling desperately to find it out,
	Torment myself to catch the English crown:
	And from that torment I will free myself,
	Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
	Why, I can smile, and murder while I smile,
	And cry, 'Content,' to that which grieves my heart,
	And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
	And frame my face to all occasions.
	I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
	I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
	I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
	Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
	And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
	I can add colours to the chameleon,
	Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
	And set the murd'rous Machiavel to school.
	Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
	Tut! were it further off, I'll pluck it down.

	King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,

	For how can tyrants safely govern home,
	Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
	To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
	That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,
	Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
	Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
	Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
	For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
	Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,

</WARWICK>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call him my king, by whose injurious doom

	No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,

</K_LEWIS>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such it seems
	As may beseem a monarch like himself.
	Myself have often heard him say and swear

	Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;

</Q_MARGARET>
<K_LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And still is friend to him and Margaret:

	Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<K_LEWIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! has your king married the Lady Grey?
	And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
	Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
	Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
	Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_LEWIS>
<Q_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told your majesty as much before:
	This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q_MARGARET>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
	And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
	That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's;
	No more my king, for he dishonours me;
	But most himself, if he could see his shame.
	Did I forget that by the house of York
	My father came untimely to his death?
	Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
	Did I impale him with the regal crown?
	Did I put Henry from his native right?
	And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
	Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
	And, to repair my honour, lost for him,
	I here renounce him and return to Henry.
	My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
	And henceforth I am thy true servitor.
	I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
	And replant Henry in his former state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<Q_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
	And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
	And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Q_MARGARET>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
	That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
	With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
	I'll undertake to land them on our coast,
	And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
	'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him:
	And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
	He's very likely now to fall from him,
	For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
	Or than for strength and safety of our country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<BONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd,
	But by thy help to this distressed queen?

	Then, England's messenger, return in post,

<Q_MARGARET>

	Had he none else to make a stale but me?
	Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.

	And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well,

	Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
	And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice,
	To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
	Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
	Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
	Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
	But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
	And now what rests, but in night's coverture,
	Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
	His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
	And but attended by a simple guard,
	We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
	Our scouts have found the adventure very easy.
	That as Ulysses, and stout Diomede,
	With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
	And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds;
	So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
	At unawares may beat down Edward's guard,
	And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
	For I intend but only to surprise him.
	You, that will follow me to this attempt,
	Applaud the name of Henry with your leader

<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but the case is alter'd:

</Q_ELIZABETH>
<RIVERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

</Q_ELIZABETH>
<RIVERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then is my sovereign slain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIVERS>
<Q_ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;
	Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
	Or by his foe surpris'd at unawares:
	And, as I further have to understand,
	Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
	Fell Warwick's brother, and by that our foe.

</Q_ELIZABETH>
<RIVERS>

<Q_ELIZABETH>

	Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.

	Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear,

	I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
	To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
	Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down.
	But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
	For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
	I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
	To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
	There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.

	Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
	Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
	Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
	Thus stands the case. You know, our king, my brother,
	Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
	He hath good usage and great liberty,
	And often but attended with weak guard,
	Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
	I have advertis'd him by secret means,
	That if about this hour he make this way,
	Under the colour of his usual game,
	He shall here find his friends, with horse and men

	Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
	Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
	Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?

</DIRECTION>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
	Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
	And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
	My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
	At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
	But if a humble prayer may prevail,
	I then crave pardon of your majesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
	Nay, be thou sure, I'll well requite thy kindness,
	For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
	Ay, such a pleasure as encaged birds
	Conceive, when, after many moody thoughts
	At last by notes of household harmony
	They quite forget their loss of liberty.
	But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
	And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
	He was the author, thou the instrument.
	Therefore, that I may conquer Fortune's spite
	By living low, where Fortune cannot hurt me,
	And that the people of this blessed land
	May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
	Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
	I here resign my government to thee,
	For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous;
	And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
	By spying and avoiding Fortune's malice;
	For few men rightly temper with the stars:
	Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace,
	For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
	To whom the heavens, in thy nativity
	Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown,
	As likely to be blest in peace, and war;
	And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I choose Clarence only for protector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands:
	Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
	That no dissension hinder government:
	I make you both protectors of this land,
	While I myself will lead a private life,
	And in devotion spend my latter days,
	To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
	For on thy fortune I repose myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why then, though loath, yet must I be content:
	We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
	To Henry's body, and supply his place;
	I mean, in bearing weight of government,
	While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
	And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
	Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor,
	And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else? and that succession be determin'd.

</CLARENCE>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
	Let me entreat, for I command no more,
	That Margaret your queen, and my son Edward,
	Be sent for, to return from France with speed:
	For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
	My joy of liberty is half eclips'd.

	That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:

	My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
	My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
	My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
	I have not been desirous of their wealth;
	Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies,
	Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look here, I throw my infamy at thee:
	I will not ruinate my father's house,
	Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
	And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
	That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
	To bend the fatal instruments of war
	Against his brother and his lawful king?
	Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
	To keep that oath were more impiety
	Than Jephthah's, when he sacrific'd his daughter.
	I am so sorry for my trespass made
	That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
	I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;
	With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
	As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad--
	To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
	And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
	And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
	Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends;
	And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
	For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

	Ah! who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,

	Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
	My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
	That I must yield my body to the earth,
	And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
	Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
	Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
	Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
	Whose top branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree,
	And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
	These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
	Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
	To search the secret treasons of the world:
	The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
	Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
	For who liv'd king, but I could dig his grave?
	And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
	Lo! now my glory smear'd in dust and blood;
	My parks, my walks, my manors that I had,
	Even now forsake me; and, of all my lands
	Is nothing left me but my body's length.

	Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
	But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
	What though the mast be now blown over-board,
	The cable broke, the holding anchor lost,
	And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
	Yet lives our pilot still: is't meet that he
	Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
	With tearful eyes add water to the sea,
	And give more strength to that which hath too much;
	Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock,
	Which industry and courage might have sav'd?
	Ah! what a shame! ah, what a fault were this.
	Say, Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
	And Montague our top-mast; what of him?
	Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
	Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
	And Somerset, another goodly mast?
	The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
	And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
	For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
	We will not from the helm, to sit and weep,
	But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
	From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack.
	As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
	And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?
	What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
	And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
	All those the enemies to our poor bark.
	Say you can swim; alas! 'tis but a while:
	Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
	Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
	Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
	This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
	In case some one of you would fly from us,
	That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers
	More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
	Why, courage, then! what cannot be avoided
	'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.

	And many an orphan's water-standing eye,
	Men for their sons', wives for their husbands',
	And orphans for their parents' timeless death,
	Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
	The owl shriek'd at thy birth, an evil sign;
	The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
	Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees!
	The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
	And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
	Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
	And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope;
	To wit an indigest deformed lump,
	Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
	Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,

	Thou cam'st--

	<DIALOGUE>
	I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
	Indeed, 'tis true, that Henry told me of;
	For I have often heard my mother say
	I came into the world with my legs forward.
	Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
	And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
	The midwife wonder'd, and the women cried
	'O! Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth.'
	And so I was; which plainly signified
	That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
	Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so,
	Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
	I have no brother, I am like no brother;
	And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,
	Be resident in men like one another
	And not in me: I am myself alone.
	Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
	But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
	For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
	That Edward shall be fearful of his life;
	And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
	King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
	Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
	Counting myself but bad till I be best.
	I'll throw thy body in another room,
