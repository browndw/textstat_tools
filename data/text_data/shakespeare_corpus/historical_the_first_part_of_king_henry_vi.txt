	<DIALOGUE>
	Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
	Comets, importing change of times and states,
	Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
	And with them scourge the bad revolting stars,
	That have consented unto Henry's death!
	King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
	England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDFORD>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	England ne'er had a king until his time.
	Virtue he had, deserving to command:
	His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;
	His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
	His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
	More dazzled and drove back his enemies
	Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
	What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
	He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
	Henry is dead and never shall revive.
	Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
	And death's dishonourable victory
	We with our stately presence glorify,
	Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
	What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
	That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
	Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
	Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
	By magic verses have contriv'd his end?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>
<WINCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
	Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day
	So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
	The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
	The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINCHESTER>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd
	His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
	None do you like but an effeminate prince,
	Whom like a school-boy you may over-awe.

</GLOUCESTER>
<WINCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gloucester, whate'er we like thou art protector,

	More than God or religious churchmen may.

</WINCHESTER>
<GLOUCESTER>

<BEDFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace!
	Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
	Instead of gold we'll offer up our arms,
	Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.
	Posterity, await for wretched years,
	When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
	Our isle be made a marish of salt tears,
	And none but women left to wail the dead.
	Henry the Fifth! thy ghost I invocate:
	Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils!
	Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
	A far more glorious star thy soul will make,
	Than Julius Caesar, or bright--

<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My honourable lords, health to you all!
	Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
	Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
	Guienne, Champaigne, Rheims, Orleans,
	Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEDFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sayst thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
	Speak softly; or the loss of those great towns
	Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.

<GLOUCESTER>

	How were they lost? what treachery was us'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No treachery; but want of men and money.
	Among the soldiers this is muttered,
	That here you maintain several factions;
	And, whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
	You are disputing of your generals.
	One would have lingering wars with little cost;
	Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
	A third thinks, without expense at all,
	By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
	Awake, awake, English nobility!
	Let not sloth dim your honours new-begot:
	Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
	Of England's coat one half is cut away.

	Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
	Give me my steeled coat: I'll fight for France.

<MESSENGER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lords, view these letters, full of bad mischance.
	France is revolted from the English quite,
	Except some petty towns of no import:
	The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;
	The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
	Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
	The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.

	The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
	O! whither shall we fly from this reproach?

	We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
	Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.

<BEDFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?

Enter a third Messenger.
</STAGE_DIR>
<MESSENGER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
	Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
	I must inform you of a dismal fight
	Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER_3>
<WINCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINCHESTER>
<MESSENGER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, no! wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:
	The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
	The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
	Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
	Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
	By three-and-twenty thousand of the French
	Was round encompassed and set upon.
	No leisure had he to enrank his men;
	He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
	Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
	They pitched in the ground confusedly,
	To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
	More than three hours the fight continued;
	Where valiant Talbot above human thought
	Enacted wonders with his sword and lance.
	Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
	Here, there, and every where, enrag'd he flew:
	The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
	All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
	His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
	A Talbot! A Talbot! cried out amain,
	And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
	Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
	If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward.
	He, being in the vaward,--plac'd behind,
	With purpose to relieve and follow them,--
	Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
	Hence grew the general wrack and massacre;
	Enclosed were they with their enemies.
	A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
	Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back;
	Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,
	Durst not presume to look once in the face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER_3>
<BEDFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
	For living idly here in pomp and ease
	Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
	Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDFORD>
<MESSENGER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O no! he lives; but is took prisoner,
	And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford:
	Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER_3>
<BEDFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
	I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;
	His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
	Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
	Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
	Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
	To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
	Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
	Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDFORD>
<MESSENGER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you had need; for Orleans is besieg'd;
	The English army is grown weak and faint;
	The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
	And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
	Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER_3>
<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
	Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
	Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>

	I do remember it; and here take my leave,

	At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,

	Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
	The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<REIGNIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think, by some odd gimmals or device,
	Their arms are set like clocks, still to strike on;

	Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:

	A holy maid hither with me I bring,
	Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
	Ordained is to raise this tedious siege,
	And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
	The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
	Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome;
	What's past and what's to come she can descry.
	Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,

	Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,

	Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
	To shine on my contemptible estate:
	Lo! whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
	And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
	God's mother deigned to appear to me,
	And in a vision full of majesty
	Will'd me to leave my base vocation
	And free my country from calamity:
	Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success;
	In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
	And, whereas I was black and swart before,
	With those clear rays which she infus'd on me,
	That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
	Ask me what question thou canst possible
	And I will answer unpremeditated:
	My courage try by combat, if thou dar'st,
	And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
	Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate
	If thou receive me for thy war-like mate.

	But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul'd by me:

	The prince's espials have informed me
	How the English, in the suburbs close entrench'd,
	Wont through a secret gate of iron bars
	In yonder tower to overpeer the city,
	And thence discover how with most advantage
	They may vex us with shot or with assault.
	To intercept this inconvenience,
	A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
	And fully even these three days have I watch'd
	If I could see them. Now, boy, do thou watch,

	</DIALOGUE>
</SALISBURY>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
	Called the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
	For him I was exchang'd and ransomed.
	But with a baser man at arms by far
	Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
	Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
	Rather than I would be so vile-esteem'd.
	In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.
	But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart:
	Whom with my bare fists I would execute
	If I now had him brought into my power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<SALISBURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.

</SALISBURY>
<TALBOT>

	With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
	In open market-place produc'd they me,
	To be a public spectacle to all:
	Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
	The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
	Then broke I from the officers that led me,
	And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
	To hurl at the beholders of my shame.
	My grisly countenance made others fly.
	None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
	In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
	So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
	That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
	And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
	Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
	That walk'd about me every minute-while;
	And if I did but stir out of my bed
	Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

	Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
	Here, through this grate, I count each one,
	And view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
	Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
	Let me have your express opinions
	Where is best place to make our battery next.

	What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
	Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
	How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
	One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
	Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
	That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
	In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
	Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
	Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
	His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
	Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
	One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace:
	The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
	Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
	If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
	Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
	Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
	Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
	Thou shalt not die, whiles--
	He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
	As who should say, 'When I am dead and gone,
	Remember to avenge me on the French.'
	Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
	Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
	Wretched shall France be only in my name

<STAGE_DIR>
Here Salisbury lifteth himself up and groans.

	Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
	It irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd.
	Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:
	Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
	Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels
	And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
	Convey me Salisbury into his tent,

	Are from their hives and houses driven away.
	They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;
	Now, like to whelps, we crying run away

<STAGE_DIR>
A short alarum.

	Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,

	And for myself, most part of all this night,

</CHARLES>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Question, my lords, no further of the case,
	How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
	But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
	And now there rests no other shift but this;
	To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispers'd,
	And lay new platforms to endamage them.

	Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,

	Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
	For every drop of blood was drawn from him
	There hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night.
	And that hereafter ages may behold
	What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,
	Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
	A tomb wherein his corse shall be interr'd:
	Upon the which, that every one may read,
	Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans,
	The treacherous manner of his mournful death,
	And what a terror he had been to France.
	But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
	I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
	His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
	Nor any of his false confederates.

	'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,

<BURGUNDY>

	Myself--as far as I could well discern

<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?

</TALBOT>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
	With modesty admiring thy renown,
	By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
	To visit her poor castle where she lies,
	That she may boast she hath beheld the man
	Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BURGUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars

	You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.

</BURGUNDY>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
	Could not prevail with all their oratory,
	Yet hath a woman's kindness over-rul'd:
	And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
	And in submission will attend on her.
	Will not your honours bear me company?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<BEDFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, truly; it is more than manners will;

<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, alone,--since there's no remedy,--

</COUNTESS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, it is.

</MESSENGER>
<COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the scourge of France?
	Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad,
	That with his name the mothers still their babes?
	I see report is fabulous and false:
	I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
	A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
	And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
	Alas! this is a child, a silly dwarf:
	It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
	Should strike such terror to his enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNTESS>
<TALBOT>

	Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;

	Prisoner! to whom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To me, blood-thirsty lord;
	And for that cause I train'd thee to my house.
	Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
	For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
	But now the substance shall endure the like,
	And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
	That hast by tyranny, these many years
	Wasted our country, slain our citizens,
	And sent our sons and husbands captivate.

	Why, art not thou the man?

</COUNTESS>
<TALBOT>

</TALBOT>
<COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then have I substance too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNTESS>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, I am but shadow of myself:
	You are deceiv'd, my substance is not here;
	For what you see is but the smallest part
	And least proportion of humanity.
	I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
	It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
	Your roof were not sufficient to contain it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
<COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
	He will be here, and yet he is not here:
	How can these contrarieties agree?

</COUNTESS>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That will I show you presently

He winds a horn. Drums strike up; a peal of ordnance. The Gates being forced, enter Soldiers.
</STAGE_DIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How say you, madam? are you now persuaded
	That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
	These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
	With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
	Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALBOT>
	And in a moment makes them desolate.
<COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
	I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,
	And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
	Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
	For I am sorry that with reverence
	I did not entertain thee as thou art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNTESS>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster
	The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
	The outward composition of his body.
	What you have done hath not offended me;
	Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
	But only, with your patience, that we may
	Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;
	For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.

<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great lords, and gentlemen, what means this silence?
	Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Within the Temple hall we were too loud;
	The garden here is more convenient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUFFOLK>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth,
	Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, I have been a truant in the law,
	And never yet could frame my will to it;
	And therefore frame the law unto my will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUFFOLK>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;
	Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
	Between two blades, which bears the better temper;
	Between two horses, which doth bear him best;
	Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;
	I have perhaps, some shallow spirit of judgment;
	But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
	Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tut, tut! here is a mannerly forbearance:
	The truth appears so naked on my side,
	That any purblind eye may find it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
	So clear, so shining, and so evident,
	That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since you are tongue-tied, and so loath to speak,
	In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
	Let him that is a true-born gentleman,
	And stands upon the honour of his birth,
	If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
	From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
	But dare maintain the party of the truth,
	Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love no colours, and, without all colour
	Of base insinuating flattery
	I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pluck this red rose with young Somerset:
	And say withal I think he held the right.

</SUFFOLK>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
	Till you conclude that he, upon whose side
	The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree,
	Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERNON>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
	If I have fewest I subscribe in silence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then for the truth and plainness of the case,
	I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
	Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERNON>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
	Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red,
	And fall on my side so, against your will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<VERNON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
	Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt,
	And keep me on the side where still I am.

</SOMERSET>
<LAWYER>
<STAGE_DIR>
To Somerset.
</STAGE_DIR>

	Unless my study and my books be false,
	The argument you held was wrong in you,
	In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, in my scabbard; meditating that
	Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meantime, your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
	For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
	The truth on our side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Plantagenet,
	'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
	Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
	And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
	Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
	That shall maintain what I have said is true,
	Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,

	Away, away! good William de la Pole:
	We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.

</SOMERSET>
<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset:
	His grandfather was Lionel, Duke of Clarence,
	Third son to the third Edward, King of England.
	Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARWICK>
<PLANTAGENET>

	He bears him on the place's privilege,
	Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words
	On any plot of ground in Christendom.
	Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
	For treason executed in our late king's days?
	And, by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,
	Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
	His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
	And, till thou be restor'd, thou art a yeoman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was attached, not attained;
	Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
	And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
	Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
	For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
	I'll note you in my book of memory,
	To scourge you for this apprehension:
	Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,
	And know us by these colours for thy foes;
	For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<PLANTAGENET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
	As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
	Will I for ever and my faction wear,
	Until it wither with me to my grave
	Or flourish to the height of my degree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLANTAGENET>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go forward, and be chok'd with thy ambition:
	And so farewell until I meet thee next.

<WARWICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This blot that they object against your house
	Shall be wip'd out in the next parliament,
	Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
	And if thou be not then created York,
	I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
	Meantime in signal of my love to thee,
	Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
	Will I upon thy party wear this rose.
	And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
	Grown to this faction in the Temple garden,
	Shall send between the red rose and the white
	A thousand souls to death and deadly night.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
	Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
	Even like a man new haled from the rack,
	So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
	And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,
	Nestor-like aged, in an age of care,
	Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
	These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
	Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
	Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,
	And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine
	That droops his sapless branches to the ground:
	Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
	Unable to support this lump of clay,
	Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
	As witting I no other comfort have.
	But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?

	Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
	Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
	Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
	Before whose glory I was great in arms,
	This loathsome sequestration have I had;
	And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,
	Depriv'd of honour and inheritance.
	But now the arbitrator of despairs,
	Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
	With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
	I would his troubles likewise were expir'd,
	That so he might recover what was lost.

	First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;

	This day, in argument upon a case,
	Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
	Among which terms he us'd a lavish tongue
	And did upbraid me with my father's death:
	Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
	Else with the like I had requited him.
	Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
	In honour of a true Plantagenet,
	And for alliance sake, declare the cause
	My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.

	I will, if that my fading breath permit,
	And death approach not ere my tale be done.
	Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
	Depos'd his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
	The first-begotten, and the lawful heir
	Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
	During whose reign the Percies of the North,
	Finding his usurpation most unjust,
	Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne.
	The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
	Was, for that--young King Richard thus remov'd,
	Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
	I was the next by birth and parentage;
	For by my mother I derived am
	From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
	To King Edward the Third; whereas he
	From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
	Being but fourth of that heroic line.
	But mark: as, in this haughty great attempt
	They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
	I lost my liberty, and they their lives.
	Long after this, when Henry the Fifth
	Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
	Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then deriv'd
	From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
	Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
	Again in pity of my hard distress
	Levied an army, weening to redeem
	And have install'd me in the diadem;
	But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl,
	And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
	In whom the title rested, were suppress'd.

	O! turn thy edged sword another way;
	Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
	One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom,

	Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
	Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe,
	And was he not in England prisoner?
	But when they heard he was thine enemy,
	They set him free, without his ransom paid,
	In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
	See then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen!

Plucking it off.
</STAGE_DIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which I have done, because unworthily

	Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest:
	This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
	When but in all I was six thousand strong,
	And that the French were almost ten to one,
	Before we met or that a stroke was given,
	Like to a trusty squire did run away:
	In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
	Myself, and divers gentlemen beside,
	Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners.

	When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,

	Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
	Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
	But always resolute in most extremes.
	He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
	Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
	Profaning this most honourable order;

	What means his Grace, that he hath chang'd his style?

	What's here? I have, upon especial cause,
	Mov'd with compassion of my country's wrack,
	Together with the pitiful complaints
	Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
	Forsaken your pernicious faction,

	About a certain question in the law
	Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him;

</JOHN>
<TALBOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,

	Of bold-fac'd victory. Then leaden age,
	Quicken'd with youthful spleen and war-like rage,
	Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,
	And from the pride of Gallia rescu'd thee.
	The ireful bastard Orleans,--that drew blood
	From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
	Of thy first fight,--I soon encountered
	And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed
	Some of his bastard blood; and, in disgrace,
	Bespoke him thus, 'Contaminated, base,
	And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
	Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
	Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'
	Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
	Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,
	Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare?
	Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
	Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
	Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead;
	The help of one stands me in little stead.
	O! too much folly is it, well I wot,
	To hazard all our lives in one small boat.
	If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
	To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
	By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
	'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
	In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
	My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame.
	All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
	All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
	These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart.
	On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
	To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
	Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
	The coward horse that bears me fall and die!
	And like me to the peasant boys of France,
	To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
	Surely, by all the glory you have won,
	An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:
	Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
	If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.

	Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:

</REIGNIER>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, there is remedy enough; my lord:
	Consent, and for thy honour, give consent,
	Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
	Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
	And this her easy-held imprisonment
	Hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty.

<REIGNIER>

	Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth

	O! wert thou for myself! But Suffolk, stay;
	Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;

	Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
	Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
	And natural graces that extinguish art;
	Repeat their semblance often on the seas,

	'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest,

	Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
	Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time

	Thy mother gave thee, when thou suck'dst her breast,
	Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
	Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field
	I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!

</YORK>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
	Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
	But issu'd from the progeny of kings;
	Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
	By inspiration of celestial grace,
	To work exceeding miracles on earth.
	I never had to do with wicked spirits:
	But you,--that are polluted with your lusts,
	Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
	Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,--
	Because you want the grace that others have,
	You judge it straight a thing impossible
	To compass wonders but by help of devils.
	No misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
	A virgin from her tender infancy,
	Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
	Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effus'd,
	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.

	Although ye hale me to a violent death.

	Especially since Charles must father it.

<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:

	Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
	And here at hand the Dauphin, and his train,
	Approacheth to confer about some matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARDINAL>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
	After the slaughter of so many peers,
	So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers,
	That in this quarrel have been overthrown,
	And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
	Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
	Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
	By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,
	Our great progenitors had conquered?
	O! Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
	The utter loss of all the realm of France.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YORK>
<WARWICK>

	Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,

<CARDINAL>

	Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
	That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
	Of mere compassion and of lenity,
	To ease your country of distressful war,
	And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
	You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
	And, Charles, upon-condition thou wilt swear
	To pay him tribute, and submit thyself,
	Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him,
	And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARDINAL>
<ALENÇON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must he be then, as shadow of himself?
	Adorn his temples with a coronet,
	And yet, in substance and authority,
	Retain but privilege of a private man?
	This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALENÇON>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis known already that I am possess'd
	With more than half the Gallian territories,
	And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king:
	Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
	Detract so much from that prerogative
	As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
	No, lord ambassador; I'll rather keep
	That which I have than, coveting for more,
	Be cast from possibility of all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<YORK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
	Us'd intercession to obtain a league,
	And now the matter grows to compromise,
	Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
	Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
	Of benefit proceeding from our king
	And not of any challenge of desert,
	Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.

</YORK>
<REIGNIER>

	My lord, you do not well in obstinacy

</REIGNIER>
<ALENÇON>
<STAGE_DIR>
Aside to Charles.
</STAGE_DIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To say the truth, it is your policy
	To save your subjects from such massacre

	Although you break it when your pleasure serves.

Enter King Henry, in conference with Suffolk; Gloucester and Exeter following.
</STAGE_DIR>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
	Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
	Her virtues, graced with external gifts
	Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
	And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
	Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
	So am I driven by breath of her renown
	Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive
	Where I may have fruition of her love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tush! my good lord, this superficial tale
	Is but a preface of her worthy praise:
	The chief perfections of that lovely dame--
	Had I sufficient skill to utter them--
	Would make a volume of enticing lines,
	Able to ravish any dull conceit:
	And, which is more, she is not so divine,
	So full replete with choice of all delights,
	But with as humble lowliness of mind
	She is content to be at your command;
	Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
	To love and honour Henry as her lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUFFOLK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
	Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent
	That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</K_HENRY>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So should I give consent to flatter sin.
	You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
	Unto another lady of esteem;
	How shall we then dispense with that contract,
	And not deface your honour with reproach?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
	Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
	To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
	By reason of his adversary's odds.
	A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
	And therefore may be broke without offence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUFFOLK>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
	Her father is no better than an earl,
	Although in glorious titles he excel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, my good lord, her father is a king,
	The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
	And of such great authority in France
	As his alliance will confirm our peace,
	And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUFFOLK>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
	Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EXETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beside, his wealth doth warrant liberal dower,
	Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXETER>
<SUFFOLK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
	That he should be so abject, base, and poor,
	To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
	Henry is able to enrich his queen,
	And not to seek a queen to make him rich:
	So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
	As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
	Marriage is a matter of more worth
	Than to be dealt in by attorneyship:
	Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
	Must be companion of his nuptial bed;
	And therefore, lords, since he affects her most
	It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
	In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
	For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,
	An age of discord and continual strife?
	Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
	And is a pattern of celestial peace.
	Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
	But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
	Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
	Approves her fit for none but for a king:
	Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit--
	More than in women commonly is seen--
	Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
	For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
	Is likely to beget more conquerors,
	If with a lady of so high resolve
	As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
	Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
	That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUFFOLK>
<K_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether it be through force of your report,
	My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that
	My tender youth was never yet attaint
	With any passion of inflaming love,
	I cannot tell; but this I am assur'd,
	I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
	Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
	As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
	Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
	Agree to any covenants, and procure
	That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
	To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
	King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
	For your expenses and sufficient charge,
	Among the people gather up a tenth.
	Be gone, I say; for till you do return
	I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
	And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
	If you do censure me by what you were,
	Not what you are, I know it will excuse
	This sudden execution of my will.
	And so, conduct me, where, from company
	I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
