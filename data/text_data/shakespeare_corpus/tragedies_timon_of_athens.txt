Scene.--Athens, and the neighbouring Woods.
</DIRECTION>
<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Athens. A Hall in Timon's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and Others, at several doors.
</DIRECTION>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad you're well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have not seen you long. How goes the world?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wears, sir, as it grows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, that's well known;
	But what particular rarity? what strange,
	Which manifold record not matches? See,
	Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
	Hath conjur'd to attend. I know the merchant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! 'tis a worthy lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that's most fix'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A most incomparable man, breath'd, as it were,
	To an untirable and continuate goodness:
	He passes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a jewel here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! pray, let's see 't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,
	It stains the glory in that happy verse
	Which aptly sings the good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<MERCHANT>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at the jewel.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis a good form.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And rich: here is a water, look ye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
	To the great lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A thing slipp'd idly from me.
	Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
	From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
	Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
	Provokes itself, and, like the current flies
	Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
	Let's see your piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis a good piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indifferent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admirable! How this grace
	Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
	This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
	Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
	One might interpret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a pretty mocking of the life.
	Here is a touch; is 't good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say of it,
	It tutors nature: artificial strife
	Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<DIRECTION>
Enter certain Senators, who pass over the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How this lord is follow'd!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The senators of Athens: happy man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, more!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
	I have, in this rough work, shap'd out a man,
	Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
	With amplest entertainment: my free drift
	Halts not particularly, but moves itself
	In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
	Infects one comma in the course I hold;
	But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
	Leaving no tract behind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How shall I understand you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will unbolt to you.
	You see how all conditions, how all minds--
	As well of glib and slippery creatures as
	Of grave and austere quality--tender down
	Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune,
	Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,
	Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
	All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
	To Apemantus, that few things loves better
	Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
	The knee before him and returns in peace
	Most rich in Timon's nod.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw them speak together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
	Feign'd Fortune to be thron'd: the base o' the mount
	Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
	That labour on the bosom of this sphere
	To propagate their states: amongst them all,
	Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
	One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
	Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
	Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
	Translates his rivals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis conceiv'd to scope.
	This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
	With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
	Bowing his head against the steepy mount
	To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
	In our condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, sir, but hear me on.
	All those which were his fellows but of late,
	Some better than his value, on the moment
	Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
	Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
	Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
	Drink the free air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, marry, what of these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
	Spurns down her late belov'd, all his dependants
	Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
	Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
	Not one accompanying his declining foot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis common:
	A thousand moral paintings I can show
	That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
	More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
	To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
	The foot above the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<DIRECTION>
Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself...
<... courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from...>
<... Ventidius talking with him, Lucilius and other servants following.>
</DIRECTION>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imprison'd is he, say you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
	His means most short, his creditors most strait:
	Your honourable letter he desires
	To those have shut him up; which, failing,
	Periods his comfort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noble Ventidius! Well;
	I am not of that feather to shake off
	My friend when he must need me. I do know him
	A gentleman that well deserves a help,
	Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt and free him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your lordship ever binds him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commend me to him. I will send his ransom;
	And being enfranchis'd, bid him come to me.
	'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
	But to support him after. Fare you well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All happiness to your honour
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
</MESSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
Enter an Old Athenian.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Timon, hear me speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freely, good father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have so: what of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attends be here or no? Lucilius!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, at your lordship's service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
	By night frequents my house. I am a man
	That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift,
	And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
	Than one which holds a trencher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well; what further?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One only daughter have I, no kin else,
	On whom I may confer what I have got:
	The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
	And I have bred her at my dearest cost
	In qualities of the best. This man of thine
	Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
	Join with me to forbid him her resort;
	Myself have spoke in vain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man is honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Therefore he will be, Timon:
	His honesty rewards him in itself;
	It must not bear my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she love him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is young and apt:
	Our own precedent passions do instruct us
	What levity's in youth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
To Lucilius.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love you the maid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If in her marriage my consent be missing,
	I call the gods to witness, I will choose
	Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
	And dispossess her all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How shall she be endow'd,
	If she be mated with an equal husband?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three talents on the present; in future, all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long:
	To build his fortune I will strain a little,
	For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter;
	What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
	And make him weigh with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<OLD_ATHENIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most noble lord,
	Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_ATHENIAN>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
	That state or fortune fall into my keeping
	Which is not ow'd to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Lucilius and Old Athenian.
</DIRECTION>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
	Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A piece of painting, which I do beseech
	Your lordship to accept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Painting is welcome.
	The painting is almost the natural man;
	For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
	He is but outside: these pencil'd figures are
	Even such as they give out. I like your work;
	And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
	Till you hear further from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gods preserve you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
	We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
	Hath suffer'd under praise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, my lord! dispraise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mere satiety of commendations.
	If I should pay you for 't as 'tis extoll'd,
	It would unclew me quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, 'tis rated
	As those which sell would give: but you well know,
	Things of like value, differing in the owners,
	Are prized by their masters. Believe 't, dear lord,
	You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well mock'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
	Which all men speak with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, who comes here. Will you be chid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Apemantus.
</DIRECTION>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll bear, with your lordship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll spare none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
	When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they not Athenians?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I repent not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<JEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know me, Apemantus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEW>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art proud, Apemantus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whither art going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a deed thou'lt die for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best, for the innocence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrought he not well that painted it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's but a filthy piece of work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; I eat not lords.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lascivious apprehension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So thou apprehendest it, take it for thy labour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What dost thou think 'tis worth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, philosopher!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou liest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art not one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I lie not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art not a poet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not feigned; he is so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, thyself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
	Art not thou a merchant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, Apemantus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<MERCHANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If traffic do it, the gods do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCHANT>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<DIRECTION>
Trumpet sounds. Enter a Servant.
</DIRECTION>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What trumpet's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis Alcihiades, and some twenty horse,
	All of companionship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt some Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence
	Till I have thanked you; when dinner's done,
	Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Alciblades, with his Company.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most welcome, sir!
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, so, there!
	Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
	That there should be small love 'mongst these sweet knaves,
	And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
	Into baboon and monkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you have sav'd my longing, and I feed
	Most hungerly on your sight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right welcome, sir!
	Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
	In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in

<DIRECTION>
Exeunt all except Apemantus.

<DIRECTION>
Enter two Lords.

<LORD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time o'day is't, Apemantus?

</LORD_1>
<APEMANTUS>

<VENTIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most honour'd Timon,

	He is gone happy, and has left me rich:

	To your free heart, I do return those talents,
	Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
	I deriv'd liberty.

</VENTIDIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! by no means,
	Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love;
	I gave it freely ever; and there's none

<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first
	To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,

<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie! thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
	Does not become a man; 'tis much to blame.
	They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est;
	But yond man is ever angry.
	Go, let him have a table by himself,
	For he does neither affect company,
	Nor is he fit for it, indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon:
	I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian, therefore, welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee, let my meat make thee silent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
	Ne'er flatter thee. O you gods! what a number
	Of men eat Timon, and he sees them not.
	It grieves me to see so many dip their meat
	In one man's blood; and all the madness is,
	He cheers them up too.
	I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
	Methinks they should invite them without knives;
	Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
	There's much example for't; the fellow that
	Sits next him now, parts bread with him, and pledges
	The breath of him in a divided draught,
	Is the readiest man to kill him: 't has been prov'd.
	If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
	Lest they should spy my wind-pipe's dangerous notes:
	Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_2>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.
	Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner,
	Honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
	This and my food are equals, there's no odds:
	Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
	Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
	I pray for no man but myself:
	Grant I may never prove so fond,
	To trust man on his oath or bond;
	Or a harlot for her weeping;
	Or a dog that seems a-sleeping;
	Or a keeper with my freedom;
	Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
	Amen. So fall to't:
	Rich men sin, and I eat root

</LORD_1>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else? why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods! think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O! what a precious comfort 'tis, to have so many, like brothers, commanding one another's fortunes. O joy! e'en made away ere it can be born. Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to forget their faults, I drink to you.

	We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves;
	And spend our flatteries to drink those men
	Upon whose age we void it up again,
	With poisonous spite and envy.
	Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
	Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves

	And my reliances on his fracted dates
	Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
	But must not break my back to heal his finger;
	Immediate are my needs, and my relief
	Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
	But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
	Put on a most importunate aspect,
	A visage of demand; for, I do fear,

	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O my good lord!
	At many times I brought in my accounts,
	Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
	And say you found them in mine honesty.
	When for some trifling present you have bid me
	Return so much, I have shook my head, and wept;
	Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
	To hold your hand more close: I did endure
	Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
	Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
	And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
	Though you hear now, too late, yet now's a time,
	The greatest of your having lacks a half
	To pay your present debts.

</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
	Call me before the exactest auditors,
	And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
	When all our offices have been oppress'd
	With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
	With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
	Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
	I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock,
	And set mine eyes at flow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, no more.

</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavens! have I said, the bounty of this lord!
	How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
	This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
	What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?
	Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
	Ah! when the means are gone that buy this praise,
	The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
	Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
	These flies are couch'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, sermon me no further;
	No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
	Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
	Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
	To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
	If I would broach the vessels of my love,
	And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
	Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
	As I can bid thee speak.

	May these add to the number that may scald thee!
	Let molten coin be thy damnation,
	Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
	Has friendship such a faint and milky heart
	It turns in less than two nights? O you gods!
	I feel my master's passion. This slave unto his honour
	Has my lord's meat in him:
	Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
	When he is turn'd to poison?
	O! may diseases only work upon 't,
	And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
	Which my lord paid for, be of any power
	To expel sickness, but prolong his hour.

</DIRECTION>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and an honourable gentleman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<STRANGER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER_1>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<STRANGER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago, one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus, to borrow so many talents, nay, urged extremely for 't, and showed what necessity belonged to 't, and yet was denied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER_2>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<STRANGER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you, denied, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER_2>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a strange case was that! now, before the gods, I am ashamed on 't. Denied that honourable man! there was very little honour showed in 't. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet, had he mistook him, and sent to me, I should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Servilius.
</DIRECTION>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see his honour

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My honoured lord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well: commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has only sent his present occasion now, my lord; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know his lordship is but merry with me;
	He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
	If his occasion were not virtuous,
	I should not urge it half so faithfully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honour! Servilius, now, before the gods, I am not able to do; the more beast, I say; I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done it now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind: and tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions say, that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIUS>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, I shall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<LUCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Servilius.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
	And he that's once denied will hardly speed.

<STRANGER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you observe this, Hostilius?

<STRANGER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, too well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER_2>
<STRANGER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why this is the world's soul; and just of the same piece
	Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
	His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
	My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
	And kept his credit with his purse,
	Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
	Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks
	But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
	And yet, O! see the monstrousness of man,
	When he looks out in an ungrateful shape,
	He does deny him, in respect of his,
	What charitable men afford to beggars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER_1>
<STRANGER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Religion groans at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER_3>
<STRANGER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For mine own part,
	I never tasted Timon in my life,
	Nor came any of his bounties over me,
	To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
	For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,
	And honourable carriage,
	Had his necessity made use of me,
	I would have put my wealth into donation,
	And the best half should have return'd to him,
	So much I love his heart. But, I perceive,
	Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
	For policy sits above conscience.

The Same. A Room in Sempronius's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Sempronius and a Servant of Timon's.
</DIRECTION>
<SEMPRONIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must he needs trouble me in 't. Hum! 'bove all others?
	He might have tried Lord Lucius, or Lucullus;
	And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
	Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
	Owe their estates unto him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEMPRONIUS>
<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord,
	They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
	They have all denied him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVILIUS>
<SEMPRONIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How! have they denied him?
	Have Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
	And does he send to me? Three? hum!
	It shows but little love or judgment in him:
	Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
	Thrice give him over; must I take the cure upon me?
	He has much disgrac'd me in 't; I'm angry at him,
	That might have known my place. I see no sense for 't,
	But his occasions might have woo'd me first;
	For, in my conscience, I was the first man
	That e'er received gift from him:
	And does he think so backwardly of me now,
	That I'll requite it last? No:
	So it may prove an argument of laughter
	To the rest, and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool.
	I had rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
	He had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
	I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
	And with their faint reply this answer join;
	Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.

<SERVILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot think but in the end the villanies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire:
	Of such a nature is his politic love.
	This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled
	Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,
	Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
	Many a bounteous year, must be employ'd
	Now to guard sure their master:
	And this is all a liberal course allows;
	Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

</PHILOTUS>
<LUCIUS' SERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him:
	You must consider that a prodigal course
	Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
	I fear,
	'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
	That is, one may reach deep enough, and yet
	Find little.

	It is against my heart.

</LUCIUS' SERVANT>
<HORTENSIUS>

	Ay,
	If money were as certain as your waiting,
	'Twere sure enough.
	Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
	When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
	Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts,
	And take down the interest into their gluttonous maws.
	You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
	Let me pass quietly:

	If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from 't; for, take 't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him; he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.

<LUCIUS' SERVANT>

	I am a humble suitor to your virtues;

	Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
	To those that without heed to plunge into 't.
	He is a man, setting his fate aside,
	Of comely virtues;
	Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice,--
	An honour in him which buys out his fault,--
	But, with a noble fury and fair spirit,
	Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,

	Is valour misbegot, and came into the world
	When sects and factions were newly born.
	He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
	The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
	His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
	And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
	To bring it into danger.
	If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
	What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot make gross sins look clear;
	To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
	If I speak like a captain.
	Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
	And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
	And let the foes quietly cut their throats
	Without repugnancy? If there be
	Such valour in the bearing, what make we
	Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
	That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
	And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
	Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
	If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords!
	As you are great, be pitifully good:
	Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
	To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
	But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
	To be in anger is impiety;
	But who is man that is not angry?
	Weigh but the crime with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You breathe in vain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In vain! his service done
	At Lacedæmon and Byzantium
	Were a sufficient briber for his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
	And slain in fight many of your enemies.
	How full of valour did he bear himself
	In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has made too much plenty with 'em;
	He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often
	Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner;
	If there were no foes, that were enough
	To overcome him; in that beastly fury
	He has been known to commit outrages
	And cherish factions; 'tis inferr'd to us,
	His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard fate! he might have died in war.
	My lords, if not for any parts in him,--
	Though his right arm might purchase his own time,
	And be in debt to none,--yet, more to move you,
	Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both;
	And, for I know your reverend ages love
	Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
	My honour to you, upon his good returns.
	If by this crime he owes the law his life,
	Why, let the war receive't in valiant gore;
	For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are for law; he dies: urge it no more,
	On height of our displeasure. Friend, or brother,
	He forfeits his own blood that spills another.

	Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live

	I am worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
	While they have told their money and let out
	Their coin upon large interest; I myself
	Rich only in large hurts: all those for this?
	Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
	Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
	It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
	It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
	That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
	My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.

	Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place: sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.--
	You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves praised: but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods! the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people, what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome.

	And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
	Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
	Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
	And minister in their steads! To general filths
	Convert, o'the instant, green virginity!
	Do't in your parents' eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast;
	Rather than render back, out with your knives,
	And cut your trusters' throats! Bound servants, steal!--
	Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,--
	And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
	Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
	Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire,
	With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
	Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
	Domestic awe, night-rest and neighbourhood,
	Instruction, manners, mysteries and trades,
	Degrees, observances, customs and laws,
	Decline to your confounding contraries,
	And let confusion live! Plagues incident to men,
	Your potent and infectious fevers heap
	On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
	Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
	As lamely as their manners! Lust and liberty
	Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
	That'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
	And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
	Sow all the Athenian bosoms, and their crop
	Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
	That their society, as their friendship, may
	Be merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee
	But nakedness, thou detestable town!
	Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
	Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
	The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
	The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
	The Athenians both within and out that wall!

	To the whole race of mankind, high and low!

	To have his pomp and all what state compounds
	But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
	Poor honest lord! brought low by his own heart,
	Undone by goodness. Strange, unusual blood,
	When man's worst sin is he does too much good!
	Who then dares to be half so kind agen?
	For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
	My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accurs'd,
	Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
	Are made thy chief affictions. Alas! kind lord,
	He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
	Of monstrous friends;
	Nor has he with him to supply his life,

	Raise me this beggar, and deny't that lord;

	The beggar native honour.
	It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
	The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
	In purity of manhood stand upright,

	Ha! you gods, why this? What this, you gods? Why, this

<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know thee well,

<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know thee too; and more than that I know thee
	I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
	With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules;
	Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
	Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
	Hath in her more destruction than thy sword
	For all her cherubin look.

	Be a whore still; they love thee not that use thee;

</TIMANDRA>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits
	Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
	I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
	The want whereof doth daily make revolt
	In my penurious band: I have heard and griev'd
	How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
	Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
	But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--

	Ay, Timon, and have cause.

<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me, Timon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That, by killing of villains, thou wast born to conquer
	My country.
	Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
	Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
	Will o'er some high-vic'd city hang his poison
	In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one.
	Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
	He is a usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron;
	It is her habit only that is honest,
	Herself's a bawd. Let not the virgin's cheek
	Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milkpaps,
	That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
	Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
	But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe,
	Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
	Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
	Hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut,
	And mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects;
	Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes,
	Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
	Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
	Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay thy soldiers:
	Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
	Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,

	Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
	The immortal gods that hear you, spare your oaths,
	I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
	And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
	Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
	Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
	And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
	Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
	With burdens of the dead; some that were hang'd,
	No matter; wear them, betray with them: whore still;
	Paint till a horse may mire upon your face:
	A pox of wrinkles!

<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consumptions sow
	In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,

	That he may never more false title plead,
	Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
	That scolds against the quality of flesh,
	And not believes himself: down with the nose,
	Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
	Of him that, his particular to foresee,
	Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate ruffians bald,
	And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
	Derive some pain from you: plague all,
	That your activity may defeat and quell
	The source of all erection. There's more gold;
	Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
	And ditches grave you all!

</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is in thee a nature but infected;
	A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
	From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
	This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
	Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,
	Hug their diseas'd perfumes, and have forgot
	That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods
	By putting on the cunning of a carper.
	Be thou a flatterer now, and seak to thrive
	By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
	And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
	Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
	And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;
	Thou gav'st thine ears, like tapsters that bid welcome,
	To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
	That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
	Rascals should have't. Do not assume my likeness.

	That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
	Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
	That have outliv'd the eagle, page thy heels
	And skip when thou point'st out? will the cold brook,
	Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste
	To cure the o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
	Whose naked natures live in all the spite
	Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks
	To the conflicting elements expos'd,
	Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
	O! thou shalt find--

</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! a knave too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
	To castigate thy pride, 'twere well; but thou
	Dost it enforcedly; thou'dst courtier be again
	Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
	Outlives incertain pomp, is crown'd before;
	The one is filling still, never complete;
	The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
	Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
	Worse than the worst, content.
	Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not by his breath that is more miserable.
	Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
	With favour never clasp'd, but bred a dog.
	Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
	The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
	To such as may the passive drudges of it
	Freely command, thou wouldst have plung'd thyself
	In general riot; melted down thy youth
	In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
	The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
	The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
	Who had the world as my confectionary,
	The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men
	At duty, more than I could frame employment,
	That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
	Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush
	Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
	For every storm that blows; I, to bear this,
	That never knew but better, is some burden:
	Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
	Hath made thee hard in 't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
	They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
	If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
	Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
	To some she beggar and compounded thee
	Poor rogue hereditary. Hence! be gone!
	If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
	Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<APEMANTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art thou proud yet?

</APEMANTUS>
<TIMON>

	I, that I am one now:

<THIEF_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender ort of his remainder. The mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his friends, drove him into this melancholy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIEF_1>
<THIEF_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIEF_2>
<THIEF_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not for 't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously reserve it, how shall's get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIEF_3>
<THIEF_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.

<THIEVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIEVES>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
	Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
	Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
	The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
	The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
	Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<THIEF_1>

	We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,

</THIEF_1>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
	You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
	That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
	In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft
	In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
	Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
	Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
	And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
	His antidotes are poison, and he slays
	More than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
	Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
	Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery:
	The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
	Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief,
	And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
	The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
	The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief,
	That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
	From general excrement, each thing's a thief;
	The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
	Have uncheck'd theft. Love not yourselves; away!
	Rob one another. There's more gold: cut throats;
	All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
	Break open shops; nothing can you steal
	But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
	I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er!
	Amen.

<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O you gods!
	Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
	Full of decay and failing? O monument
	And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
	What an alteration of honour
	Has desperate want made!
	What viler thing upon the earth than friends
	Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
	How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
	When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
	Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
	Those that would mischief me than those that do!
	He hath caught me in his eye: I will present
	My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
	Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!

Timon comes forward.
</DIRECTION>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away! what art thou?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you forgot me, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
	Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An honest poor servant of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I know thee not:
	I never had an honest man about me; ay all
	I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gods are witness,
	Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
	For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee,
	Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
	Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give,
	But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
	Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
	To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
	To entertain me as your steward still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had I a steward
	So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
	It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
	Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
	Was born of woman.
	Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
	You perpetual sober gods! I do proclaim
	One honest man, mistake me not, but one;
	No more, I pray, and he's a steward.
	How fain would I have hated all mankind!
	And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
	I fell with curses.
	Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
	For, by oppressing and betraying me,
	Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
	For many so arrive at second masters
	Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,--
	For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure,--
	Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
	If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts,
	Expecting in return twenty for one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
	Doubt and suspect, alas! are plac'd too late.
	You should have fear'd false times when you did feast;
	Suspect still comes when an estate is least.
	That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
	Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
	Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
	My most honour'd lord,
	For any benefit that points to me,
	Either in hope, or present, I'd exchange
	For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
	To requite me by making rich yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look thee, 'tis so. Thou singly honest man,
	Here, take: the gods out of my misery,
	Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
	But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
	Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
	But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
	Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
	What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
	Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,
	And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
	And so, farewell and thrive.

	O! let me stay
	And comfort you, my master.

	Curses, stay not; fly, whilst thou'rt bless'd and free:

<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
The Woods. Before Timon's Cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Poet and Painter.
</DIRECTION>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he abides.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of gold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity. 'Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing else; you shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in us, and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travel for, if it be a just and true report that goes of his having.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you now to present unto him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing at this time but my visitation; only, I will promise him an excellent piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must serve him so too; tell him of an intent that's coming towards him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the time; it opens the eyes of expectation; performance is ever the duller for his act; and, but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is most courtly and fashionable; performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Timon from his cave.
</DIRECTION>
<TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, let's seek him:
	Then do we sin against our own estate,
	When we may profit meet, and come too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True;
	When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
	Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light.
	Come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold,
	That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
	Than where swine feed!
	'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
	Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
	To thee be worship; and thy saints for aye
	Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey.
	Fit I meet them.

	Our late noble master!

</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir,
	Having often of your open bounty tasted,
	Hearing you were retir'd, your friends fall'n off,
	Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!
	Not all the whips of heaven are large enough--
	What! to you,
	Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
	To their whole being! I am rapt, and cannot cover
	The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
	With any size of words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go naked, men may see 't the better:
	You, that are honest, by being what you are,
	Make them best seen and known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He and myself
	Have travell'd in the great shower of your gifts,
	And sweetly felt it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, you are honest men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are hither come to offer you our service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
	Can you eat roots and drink cold water? no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOTH>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ye're honest men. Ye've heard that I have gold;
	I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
	Came not my friend nor I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
	Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
	Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, so, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAINTER>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
	Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
	That thou art even natural in thine art.
	But for all this, my honest-natur'd friends,
	I must needs say you have a little fault:
	Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
	You take much pains to mend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beseech your honour
	To make it known to us.

<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll take it ill.

</TIMON>

</BOTH>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you indeed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubt it not, worthy lord.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we, my lord?

</BOTH>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
	Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
	Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur'd
	That he's a made-up villain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<PAINTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</POET>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,

	Confound them by some course, and come to me,
	I'll give you gold enough.

	Name them, my lord; let's know them.

	Come not near him

<DIRECTION>
To the Poet.

</TIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Flavius and two Senators.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
	For he is set so only to himself
	That nothing but himself, which looks like man,
	Is friendly with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring us to his cave:
	It is our part and promise to the Athenians
	To speak with Timon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At all times alike
	Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
	That fram'd him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
	Offering the fortunes of his former days,
	The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
	And chance it as it may.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is his cave.
	Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
	Look out, and speak to friends. The Athenians,
	By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:
	Speak to them, noble Timon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Timon, from his cave.
</DIRECTION>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thousun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and be hang'd:
	For each true word, a blister! and each false
	Be as a cauterizing to the root o'the tongue,
	Consuming it with speaking!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worthy Timon,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
	Could I but catch it for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! forget
	What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
	The senators with one consent of love
	Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
	On special dignities, which vacant lie
	For thy best use and wearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They confess
	Toward thee forgetfulness to general, gross;
	Which now the public body, which doth seldom
	Play the recanter, feeling in itself
	A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
	Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
	And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
	Together with a recompense more fruitful
	Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
	Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
	As shall to thee block out what wrongs were theirs,
	And write in thee the figures of their love,
	Ever to read them thine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You witch me in it;
	Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
	Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
	And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Therefore so please thee to return with us,
	And of our Athens--thine and ours--to take
	The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
	Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
	Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
	Of Alcibiades the approaches wild;

	Therefore, Timon,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:--
	If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
	Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
	That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,
	And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
	Giving our holy virgins to the stain
	Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war;
	Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
	In pity of our aged and our youth
	I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
	And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not
	While you have throats to answer: for myself,
	There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
	But I do prize it at my love before
	The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
	To the protection of the prosperous gods,
	As thieves to keepers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay not; all's in vain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
	It will be seen to-morrow. My long sickness
	Of health and living now begins to mend,
	And nothing brings me all things. Go; live still:
	Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
	And last so long enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We speak in vain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But yet I love my country, and am not
	One that rejoices in the common wrack,
	As common bruit doth put it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's well spoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commend me to my loving countrymen,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These words become your lips as they pass through them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And enter in our ears like great triumphers
	In their applauding gates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commend me to them;
	And tell them, that, to ease them of their griefs,
	Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
	Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
	That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
	In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
	I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like this well; he will return again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a tree which grows here in my close,
	That mine own use invites me to cut down,
	And shortly must I fell it; tell my friends,
	Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,
	From high to low throughout, that whoso please
	To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
	Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
	And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIMON>
<FLAVIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAVIUS>
<TIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come not to me again; but say to Athans,
	Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
	Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
	Who once a day with his embossed froth
	The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
	And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
	Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
	What is amiss plague and infection mend!
	Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
	Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.

	Our hope in him is dead: let us return,

	In our dear peril.

Before the Walls of Athens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter two Senators and a Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
	As full as thy report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have spoke the least;
	Besides, his expedition promises
	Present approach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
	Whom, though in general part we were oppos'd,
	Yet our old love made a particular force,
	And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
	From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
	With letters of entreaty, which imported
	His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
	In part for his sake mov'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here come our brothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Senators from Timon.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
	The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
	Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare:
	Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_3>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.

</SCENE_2>
<SCENE_3>
<DIRECTION>
The Woods. Timon's Cave, and a rude Tomb seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Soldier, seeking Timon.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By all description this should be the place.
	Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
	Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
	Some beast rear'd this; here does not live a man.
	Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
	I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
	Our captain hath in every figure skill;
	An ag'd interpreter, though young in days.
	Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
	Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
	</DIALOGUE>

Before the Walls of Athens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trumpets sound. Enter Alciblades with his Powers.
</DIRECTION>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sound to this coward and lascivious town
	Our terrible approach
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A parley sounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Senators, on the Walls.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Till now you have gone on, and fill'd the time
	With all licentious measure, making your wills
	The scope of justice; till now myself and such
	As slept within the shadow of your power
	Have wander'd with our travers'd arms, and breath'd
	Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,
	When crouching marrow, in the bearer strong,
	Cries of itself, 'No more:' now breathless wrong
	Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
	And pursy insolence shall break his wind
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
	With fear and horrid flight.
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noble and young,
	When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
	Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
	We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
	To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
	Above their quantity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did we woo
	Transformed Timon to our city's love
	By humble message and by promis'd means:
	We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
	The common stroke of war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These walls of ours
	Were not erected by their hands from whom
	You have receiv'd your grief; nor are they such
	That these great towers, trophies, and schools should fall
	For private faults in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor are they living
	Who were the motives that you first went out;
	Shame that they wanted cunning in excess
	Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
	Into our city with thy banners spread:
	By decimation, and a tithed death,--
	If thy revenges hunger for that food
	Which nature loathes,--take thou the destin'd tenth,
	And by the hazard of the spotted die
	Let die the spotted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All have not offended;
	For those that were, it is not square to take
	On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
	Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
	Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
	Spare thyAthenian cradle, and those kin
	Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
	With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
	Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth,
	But kill not all together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What thou wilt,
	Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
	Thank hew to't with thy sword.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Set but thy foot
	Against our rampir'd gates, and they shall ope,
	So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
	To say thou'lt enter friendly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw thy glove,
	Or any token of thine honour else,
	That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
	And not as our confusion, all thy powers
	Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
	Have seal'd thy full desire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there's my glove;
	Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
	Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
	Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof,
	Fall, and no more; and, to atone your fears
	With my more noble meaning, not a man
	Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
	Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
	But shall be render'd to your public laws
	At heaviest answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALCIBIADES>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis most nobly spoken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOTH>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Descend, and keep your words

<DIRECTION>
The Senators descend, and open the gates.
</DIRECTION>
</ALCIBIADES>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My noble general, Timon is dead;
	Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea:
	And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
	With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
	Interprets for my poor ignorance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ALCIBIADES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
	Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!
	Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
	Pass by, and curse thy fill; but pass and stay not here thy gait.
	These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
	Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
	Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which
	From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
	Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
	On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
	Is noble Timon; of whose memory
	Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
	And I will use the olive with my sword;
	Make war breed peace; make peace stint war; make each
	Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
	Let our drums strike.
	</DIALOGUE>

Exeunt.
