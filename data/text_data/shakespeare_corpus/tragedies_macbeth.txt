Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain,...
<... Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant.>
</DIRECTION>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What bloody man is that? He can report,
	As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
	The newest state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNCAN>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the sergeant
	Who, like a good and hardy soldier fought
	'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
	Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
	As thou didst leave it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubtful it stood;
	As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
	And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
	Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
	The multiplying villanies of nature
	Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
	Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
	And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
	Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak;
	For brave Macbeth,--well he deserves that name,--
	Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
	Which smok'd with bloody execution,
	Like valour's minion carv'd out his passage
	Till he fac'd the slave;
	Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
	Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
	And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNCAN>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
	Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,
	So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
	Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
	No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
	Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
	But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
	With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
	Began a fresh assault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dismay'd not this
	Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNCAN>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes;
	As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
	If I say sooth, I must report they were
	As cannons overcharg'd with double cracks;
	So they
	Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
	Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
	Or memorize another Golgotha,
	I cannot tell--
	But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNCAN>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Fife, great king;
	Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
	And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
	With terrible numbers,
	Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
	The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
	Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
	Confronted him with self-comparisons,
	Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,
	Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
	The victory fell on us.--

<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great happiness!

	Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
	Nor would we deign him burial of his men
	Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
	Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
	Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,

	That man may question? You seem to understand me,

	Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear

	Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
	You greet with present grace and great prediction
	Of noble having and of royal hope,
	That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
	If you can look into the seeds of time,

	Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
	By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
	But how of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor lives,
	A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
	Stands not within the prospect of belief
	No more than to be Cawdor. Say, from whence
	You owe this strange intelligence? or why
	Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
	With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

<ROSS>

	The king hath happily receiv'd, Macbeth,
	The news of thy success; and when he reads
	Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
	His wonders and his praises do contend
	Which should be thine or his. Silenc'd with that,
	In viewing o'er the rest o' the self-same day,
	He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
	Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
	Strange images of death. As thick as hail
	Came post with post, and every one did bear
	Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
	And pour'd them down before him.

<ANGUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was the thane lives yet;
	But under heavy judgment bears that life
	Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin'd
	With those of Norway, or did line the rebel

</MACBETH>
<BANQUO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That, trusted home,
	Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,

	This supernatural soliciting
	Cannot be ill, cannot be good; if ill,
	Why hath it given me earnest of success,
	Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:
	If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
	Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
	And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
	Against the use of nature? Present fears
	Are less than horrible imaginings;
	My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
	Shakes so my single state of man that function
	Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is

	O worthiest cousin!

	They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed me, 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with, 'Hail, king that shall be!' This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightest not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.
	Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
	What thou art promis'd. Yet do I fear thy nature;
	It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
	To catch the nearest way; thou wouldst be great,
	Art not without ambition, but without
	The illness should attend it; what thou wouldst highly,
	That thou wouldst holily; wouldst not play false,
	And yet wouldst wrongly win; thou'dst have, great Glamis,
	That which cries, 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;'
	And that which rather thou dost fear to do
	Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,
	That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
	And chastise with the valour of my tongue
	All that impedes thee from the golden round,
	Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem

	The raven himself is hoarse
	That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
	Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
	That tend on mortal thoughts! unsex me here,
	And fill me from the crown to the toe top full
	Of direst cruelty; make thick my blood,
	Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
	That no compunctious visitings of nature
	Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
	The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
	And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
	Wherever in your sightless substances
	You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
	And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
	That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
	Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
	To cry, 'Hold, hold!

	O! never

	Your face, my thane, is as a book where men

	Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
	Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
	But be the serpent under't. He that's coming

	If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
	It were done quickly; if the assassination
	Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
	With his surcease success; that but this blow
	Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
	But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
	We'd jump the life to come. But in these cases
	We still have judgment here; that we but teach
	Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
	To plague the inventor; this even-handed justice
	Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
	To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
	First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
	Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
	Who should against his murderer shut the door,
	Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
	Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
	So clear in his great office, that his virtues
	Will plead like angels trumpet-tongu'd against
	The deep damnation of his taking-off;
	And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
	Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, hors'd
	Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
	Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
	That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
	To prick the sides of my intent, but only
	Vaulting ambition, which o'er-leaps itself
	And falls on the other.--

</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>

	We will proceed no further in this business:

	Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
	Not cast aside so soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the hope drunk,
	Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since,
	And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
	At what it did so freely? From this time
	Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
	To be the same in thine own act and valour
	As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
	Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
	And live a coward in thine own esteem,
	Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
	Like the poor cat i' the adage?

</MACBETH>
<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What beast was't, then,
	That made you break this enterprise to me?
	When you durst do it then you were a man;
	And, to be more than what you were, you would
	Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
	Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
	They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
	Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
	How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
	I would, while it was smiling in my face,
	Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
	And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
	Have done to this.

	Soundly invite him, his two chamberlains
	Will I with wine and wassail so convince
	That memory, the warder of the brain,
	Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
	A limbeck only; when in swinish sleep
	Their drenched natures lie, as in a death,
	What cannot you and I perform upon
	The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
	His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
	Of our great quell?

	Bring forth men-children only;

	That they have done't?

	Is this a dagger which I see before me,
	The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
	I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
	Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
	To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
	A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
	Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
	I see thee yet, in form as palpable
	As this which now I draw.
	Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
	And such an instrument I was to use.
	Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
	Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
	And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
	Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
	It is the bloody business which informs
	Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world
	Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
	The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
	Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd murder,
	Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
	Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
	With Tarquin's ravishing strides, toward his design
	Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
	Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
	Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
	And take the present horror from the time,
	Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat he lives:
	Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives

	It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
	Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:

<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
	Macbeth does murder sleep,' the innocent sleep,
	Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,

<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
	You do unbend your noble strength to think
	So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
	And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
	Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
	They must lie there: go carry them, and smear
	The sleepy grooms with blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go no more:
	I am afraid to think what I have done;
	Look on 't again I dare not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Infirm of purpose!
	Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
	Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood

	Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTER>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What three things does drink especially provoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, mose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery; it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

</PORTER>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That it did, sir, i' the very throat o' me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.

	The night has been unruly: where we lay,

<LENNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
	Their hands and faces were all badg'd with blood;

	And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
	For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
	Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers

	Ah! good father,

	When living light should kiss it?

</ROSS>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis unnatural,

</OLD_MAN>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Duncan's horses,--a thing most strange and certain,--

	To be thus is nothing;
	But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
	Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
	Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares,
	And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
	He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
	To act in safety. There is none but he
	Whose being I do fear; and under him
	My genius is rebuk'd, as it is said
	Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
	When first they put the name of king upon me,
	And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,
	They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
	Upon my head they plac'd a fruitless crown,
	And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
	Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
	No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
	For Banquo's issue have I fil'd my mind;
	For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
	Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
	Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
	Given to the common enemy of man,
	To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
	Rather than so, come fate into the list,
	And champion me to the utterance! Who's there

<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, now
	Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
	That it was he in the times past which held you
	So under fortune, which you thought had been
	Our innocent self. This I made good to you
	In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
	How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,
	Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
	To half a soul and to a notion craz'd
	Say, 'Thus did Banquo.'

<MURDERER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made it known to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER_1>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did so; and went further, which is now
	Our point of second meeting. Do you find
	Your patience so predominant in your nature
	That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
	To pray for this good man and for his issue,
	Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
	And beggar'd yours for ever?

	Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
	As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
	Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves, are clept
	All by the name of dogs: the valu'd file
	Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
	The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
	According to the gift which bounteous nature
	Hath in him clos'd; whereby he does receive
	Particular addition, from the bill
	That writes them all alike: and so of men.
	Now, if you have a station in the file,
	Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it;
	And I will put that business in your bosoms,
	Whose execution takes your enemy off,
	Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
	Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
	Which in his death were perfect.

	So is he mine; and in such bloody distance
	That every minute of his being thrusts
	Against my near'st of life: and though I could
	With bare-fac'd power sweep him from my sight
	And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
	For certain friends that are both his and mine,
	Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
	Whom I myself struck down; and thence it is
	That I to your assistance do make love,

	Fleance his son, that keeps him company,

Enter Macbeth.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
	Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
	Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
	With them they think on? Things without all remedy
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_MACBETH>
	Should be without regard: what's done is done.
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
	She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
	Remains in danger of her former tooth.
	But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
	Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
	In the affliction of these terrible dreams
	That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
	Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
	Than on the torture of the mind to lie
	In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
	After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
	Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
	Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
	Can touch him further.

	Come on;
	Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
	Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.
	Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
	Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
	Unsafe the while, that we
	Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
	And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
	Disguising what they are.

</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
	Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
	His cloister'd flight, ere, to black Hecate's summons
	The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
	Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
	A deed of dreadful note.

	What's to be done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>

	Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
	Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
	Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
	And with thy bloody and invisible hand
	Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
	Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow
	Makes wing to the rooky wood;
	Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
	Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
	Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
	Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill:
	So, prithee, go with me.

Enter First Murderer, to the door.

<MACBETH>

	My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art the best o' the cut-throats; yet he's good

<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most royal sir,
	Fleance is 'scap'd.

</MURDERER>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;
	Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
	As broad and general as the casing air:
	But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in
	To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<MURDERER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, my good lord; safe in a ditch he bides,
	With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
	The least a death to nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURDERER>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for that.
	There the grown serpent lies: the worm that's fled
	Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
	No teeth for the present. Get thee gone; to-morrow

<DIRECTION>
Exit Murderer.

<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My royal lord,
	You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
	That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
	'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
	From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;
	Meeting were bare without it.

	Gentlemen, rise; his highness is not well.

<LADY_MACBETH>

	Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
	And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;

	You shall offend him and extend his passion:
	Feed and regard him not. Are you a man?

</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
	Which might appal the devil.

</MACBETH>
<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O proper stuff!
	This is the very painting of your fear;
	This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
	Led you to Duncan. O! these flaws and starts--
	Impostors to true fear--would well become
	A woman's story at a winter's fire,
	Authoriz'd by her grandam. Shame itself!
	Why do you make such faces? When all's done
	You look but on a stool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_MACBETH>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you?
	Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
	If charnel-houses and our graves must send
	Those that we bury back, our monuments
	Shall be the maws of kites.

	Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,

	Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
	Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
	That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
	And there an end; but now they rise again,
	With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
	And push us from our stools: this is more strange

	I'll catch it ere it come to ground:

	<DIALOGUE>
	My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
	Which can interpret further: only, I say,
	Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
	Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
	And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
	Whom, you may say, if 't please you, Fleance kill'd,
	For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
	Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
	It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
	To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
	How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight

	What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
	But, peace! for from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd.
	His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,

<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The son of Duncan,
	From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
	Lives in the English court, and is receiv'd
	Of the most pious Edward with such grace
	That the malevolence of fortune nothing
	Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
	Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
	To wake Northumberland and war-like Siward:
	That, by the help of these--with him above
	To ratify the work--we may again
	Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
	Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
	Do faithful homage and receive free honours;
	All which we pine for now. And this report
	Hath so exasperate the king that he
	Prepares for some attempt at war.

	That clogs me with this answer.'

	May soon return to this our suffering country

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have lost my hopes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
	Why in that rawness left you wife and child--
	Those precious motives, those strong knots of love--
	Without leave-taking? I pray you,
	Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
	But mine own safeties: you may be rightly just,
	Whatever I shall think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bleed, bleed, poor country!
	Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
	For goodness dares not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
	The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
	I would not be the villain that thou think'st
	For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
	And the rich East to boot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be not offended:
	I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
	I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
	It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
	Is added to her wounds: I think withal,
	There would be hands uplifted in my right;
	And here from gracious England have I offer
	Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
	When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
	Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
	Shall have more vices than it had before,
	More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
	By him that shall succeed.

</MALCOLM>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should he be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is myself I mean; in whom I know
	All the particulars of vice so grafted,
	That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
	Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
	Esteem him as a lamb, being compar'd
	With my confineless harms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in the legions
	Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
	In evils to top Macbeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I grant him bloody,
	Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
	Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
	That has a name; but there's no bottom, none,
	In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
	Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up
	The cistern of my lust; and my desire
	All continent impediments would o'erbear
	That did oppose my will; better Macbeth
	Than such an one to reign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boundless intemperance
	In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
	Th' untimely emptying of the happy throne,
	And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
	To take upon you what is yours; you may
	Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
	And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
	We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
	That vulture in you, to devour so many
	As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
	Finding it so inclin'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With this there grows
	In my most ill-compos'd affection such
	A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
	I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
	Desire his jewels and this other's house;
	And my more-having would be as a sauce
	To make me hunger more, that I should forge
	Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
	Destroying them for wealth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This avarice
	Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
	Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
	The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
	Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
	Of your mere own; all these are portable,
	With other graces weigh'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
	As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
	Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
	Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
	I have no relish of them, but abound
	In the division of each several crime,
	Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
	Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
	Uproar the universal peace, confound
	All unity on earth.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fit to govern!
	No, not to live. O nation miserable,
	With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
	When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
	Since that the truest issue of thy throne
	By his own interdiction stands accurs'd,
	And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
	Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,
	Oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet,
	Died every day she liv'd. Fare thee well!
	These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
	Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
	Thy hope ends here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Macduff, this noble passion,
	Child of integrity, hath from my soul
	Wip'd the black scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
	To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
	By many of these trains hath sought to win me
	Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
	From over-credulous haste; but God above
	Deal between thee and me! for even now
	I put myself to thy direction, and
	Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
	The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
	For strangers to my nature. I am yet
	Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
	Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
	At no time broke my faith, would not betray
	The devil to his fellow, and delight
	No less in truth than life; my first false speaking
	Was this upon myself. What I am truly,
	Is thine and my poor country's to command;
	Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
	Old Siward, with ten thousand war-like men,
	Already at a point, was setting forth.
	Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
	Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis call'd the evil:
	A most miraculous work in this good king,
	Which often, since my here-remain in England,
	I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
	Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
	All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
	The mere despair of surgery, he cures;
	Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
	Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken
	To the succeeding royalty he leaves
	The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
	He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
	And sundry blessings hang about his throne
	That speak him full of grace.

</MACDUFF>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! poor country;
	Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
	Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
	But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
	Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
	Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
	A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
	Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
	Expire before the flowers in their caps,
	Dying or ere they sicken.

</MACDUFF>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I came hither to transport the tidings,
	Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
	Of many worthy fellows that were out;
	Which was to my belief witness'd the rather
	For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot.
	Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
	Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
	To doff their dire distresses.

</ROSS>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be 't their comfort,

<ROSS>

	I shall do so;

	They were all struck for thee. Naught that I am,

</DOCTOR>
<GENTLEWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEWOMAN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?

<GENTLEWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That, sir, which I will not report after her.

	How came she by that light?

<LADY_MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two: why, then, 'tis time to do't. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?

	Seyton!--I am sick at heart

	I have liv'd long enough: my way of life

	As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,

<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so sick, my lord,
	As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,

</DOCTOR>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cure her of that:
	Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,
	Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
	Raze out the written troubles of the brain,

	Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff

<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
	The cry is still, 'They come;' our castle's strength

	We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,

A cry of women within.

Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
	The time has been my senses would have cool'd
	To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
	Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
	As life were in 't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
	Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
	Cannot once start me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Seyton.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore was that cry?
<SEYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The queen, my lord, is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEYTON>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She should have died hereafter;
	There would have been a time for such a word.
	To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
	Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
	To the last syllable of recorded time;
	And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
	The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
	Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
	That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
	And then is heard no more; it is a tale
	Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
	Signifying nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou com'st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gracious my lord,
	I should report that which I say I saw,
	But know not how to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, say, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
	I look'd towards Birnam, and anon, methought,
	The wood began to move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liar and slave!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me endure your wrath if't be not so:
	Within this three mile may you see it coming;
	I say, a moving grove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If thou speak'st false,
	Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
	Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,
	I care not if thou dost for me as much.
	I pull in resolution and begin
	To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
	That lies like truth; 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
	Do come to Dunsinane;' and now a wood
	Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
	If this which he avouches does appear,
	There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
	I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,
	And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
	Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
	At least we'll die with harness on our back.

	According to our order.

	That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face:
	If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
	My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
	I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
	Are hir'd to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
	Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
	I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
	By this great clatter, one of greatest note
	Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!

Enter Malcolm and Old Siward.

<SIWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:

	The day almost itself professes yours,

	With blood of thine already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<MACDUFF>

	I have no words;

<DIRECTION>
They fight.
</DIRECTION>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou losest labour:
	As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
	With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
	Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
	I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
	To one of woman born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Despair thy charm;
	And let the angel whom thou still hast serv'd
	Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
	Untimely ripp'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
	For it hath cow'd my better part of man:
	And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd,
	That palter with us in a double sense;
	That keep the word of promise to our ear,
	And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACBETH>
<MACDUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then yield thee, coward,
	And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:

	Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
	'Here may you see the tyrant.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACDUFF>
<MACBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not yield,
	To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
	And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
	Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
	And thou oppos'd, being of no woman born,
	Yet I will try the last: before my body
	I throw my war-like shield. Lay on, Macduff,
