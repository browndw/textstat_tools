<CHORUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two households, both alike in dignity,
	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
	Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
	Is now the two hours' traffick of our stage;
	The which if you with patient ears attend,
	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend

<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Verona. A Public Place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Sampson and Gregory, armed with swords and bucklers.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. for then we should be colliers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I strike quickly, being moved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runnest away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The heads of the maids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must take it in sense that feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes two of the house of the Montagues.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Abraham and Balthasar.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I will back thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How! turn thy back and run?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear me not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, marry; I fear thee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do bite my thumb, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>
<DIRECTION>
Aside to Gregory.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the law of our side if I say ay?

</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Aside to Sampson.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you quarrel, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<ABRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quarrel, sir! no, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Aside to Sampson.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, 'better;' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, better, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMPSON>
<ABRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABRAHAM>
<SAMPSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They fight.
</DIRECTION>
</SAMPSON>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Benvolio.
</DIRECTION>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part, fools!
	Put up your swords; you know not what you do
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beats down their swords.
</DIRECTION>
</BENVOLIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Tybalt.
</DIRECTION>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
	Turn-thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
	Or manage it to part these men with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,
	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
	Have at thee, coward
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They fight.
</DIRECTION>
</TYBALT>
<DIRECTION>
Enter several persons of both houses, who join the...
<... fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs and partisans.>
</DIRECTION>
<CITIZENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZENS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_CAPULET>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Montague and Lady Montague.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not; let me go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<LADY_MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_MONTAGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Prince with his Train.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
	Will they not hear? What ho! you men, you beasts,
	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
	Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground,
	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
	And made Verona's ancient citizens
	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
	If ever you disturb our streets again
	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
	For this time, all the rest depart away:
	You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
	And, Montague, come you this afternoon
	To know our further pleasure in this case,
	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.
</DIRECTION>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who set this ancient quarrel new a-broach?
	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here were the servants of your adversary
	And yours close fighting ere I did approach:
	I drew to part them; in the instant came
	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd,
	Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
	He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
	Who, nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn.
	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
	Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<LADY_MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
	So early walking did I see your son:
	Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
	And stole into the covert of the wood:
	I, measuring his affections by my own,
	That most are busied when they're most alone,
	Pursu'd my humour not pursuing his,
	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
	With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:
	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
	Away from light steals home my heavy son,
	And private in his chamber pens himself,
	Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
	And makes himself an artificial night.
	Black and portentous must this humour prove
	Unless good-counsel may the cause remove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you importun'd him by any means?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both by myself and many other friends:
	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
	Is to himself, I will not say how true,
	But to himself so secret and so close,
	So far from sounding and discovery,
	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
	We would as willingly give cure as know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See where he comes: so please you, step aside;
	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Montague and Lady.
</DIRECTION>
</MONTAGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Romeo.
</DIRECTION>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow, cousin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the day so young?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But new struck nine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not having that, which having, makes them short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! that love, so gentle in his view,
	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! that love, whose view is muffled still,
	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will.
	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:
	Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
	O any thing! of nothing first create.
	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
	Dost thou not laugh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, coz, I rather weep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good heart, at what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At thy good heart's oppression.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, such is love's transgression.
	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
	Which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd
	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
	Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
	Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
	Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
	A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
	Farewell, my coz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Going.
</DIRECTION>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft, I will go along;
	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here;
	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! shall I groan and tell thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Groan! why, no;
	But sadly tell me who.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will;
	Ah! word ill urg'd to one that is so ill.
	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
	O! she is rich in beauty; only poor
	That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
	For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
	To merit bliss by making me despair:
	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be rul'd by me; forget to think of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! teach me how I should forget to think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By giving liberty unto thine eyes:
	Examine other beauties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis the way
	To call hers exquisite, in question more.
	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
	He, that is strucken blind cannot forget
	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
	What doth her beauty serve but as a note
	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.

</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Same. A Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servant.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Montague is bound as well as I,
	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
	And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But saying o'er what I have said before:
	My child is yet a stranger in the world,
	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
	Let two more summers wither in their pride
	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARIS>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
	Earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
	My will to her consent is but a part;
	An she agree, within her scope of choice
	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
	Whereto I have invited many a guest
	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
	At my poor house look to behold this night
	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
	When well-apparel'd April on the heel
	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
	Which on more view, of many mine being one
	May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
	Come, go with me
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Servant, giving him a paper.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, sirrah, trudge about
	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Capulet and Paris.
</DIRECTION>
<SERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons, whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
</DIRECTION>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tut! man, one fire burns out another's burning,
	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
	And the rank poison of the old will die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what, I pray thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For your broken shin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
	Whipp'd and tormented, and--Good den, good fellow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God gi' good den. I pray, sir, can you read?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<SERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you have learn'd it without book: but, I pray, can you read any thing you see?

</LADY_CAPULET>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
	Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
	She was too good for me. But, as I said,
	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
	And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it,
	Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
	My lord and you were then at Mantua.
	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool!
	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.
	'Shake,' quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
	To bid me trudge:
	And since that time it is eleven years;
	For then she could stand high lone; nay, by the rood,
	She could have run and waddled all about;
	For even the day before she broke her brow:
	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my halidom,
	The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
	To see now how a jest shall come about!
	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_CAPULET>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh,
	To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay.'
	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
	'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
	Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
	</DIALOGUE>

	I have my wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
	How stands your disposition to be married?

</LADY_CAPULET>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is an honour that I dream not of.

</NURSE>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
	Are made already mothers: by my count,
	I was your mother much upon these years
	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief,
	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

	Examine every married lineament,
	And see how one another lends content;
	And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
	For fair without the fair within to hide:
	That book in many eyes doth share the glory,
	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story:
	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
	By having him making yourself no less.

	O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Queen Mab! What's she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
	Drawn with a team of little atomies
	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
	Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
	The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
	The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
	The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
	Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
	Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
	Not half so big as a round little worm
	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
	Time out o' mind the fairies' coach-makers.
	And in this state she gallops night by night
	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
	O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream;
	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
	Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
	And sometimes comes she with a tithe pig's tail,
	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
	Then dreams he of another benefice;
	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish bladed,
	Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
	And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
	That plats the manes of horses in the night;
	And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
	Which once untangled much misfortune bodes;
	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
	Making them women of good carriage:
	This is she--

	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace, peace! Mercutio, peace!
	Thou talk'st of nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, I talk of dreams,
	Which are the children of an idle brain,
	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
	Which is as thin of substance as the air,
	And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
	With this night's revels, and expire the term
	Of a despised life clos'd in my breast
	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
	But he, that hath the steerage of my course,

<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,

	Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,

	Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again,
	Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
	But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
	Being held a foe, he may not have access
	To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear;
	And she as much in love, her means much less
	To meet her new-beloved any where:

	Call, good Mercutio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I'll conjure too.
	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
	Speak but one rime and I am satisfied;
	Cry but 'Ay me!' couple but 'love' and 'dove;'
	Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word.
	One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
	Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
	When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid.
	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
	By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,
	By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
	That in thy likeness thou appear to us.

<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
	Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;
	That were some spite: my invocation
	Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
	I conjure only but to raise up him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
	To be consorted with the humorous night:
	Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
	Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
	And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
	As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
	O Romeo! that she were, O! that she were
	An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear.
	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
	This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
	Come, shall we go?

<DIRECTION>
Juliet appears above at a window.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
	Who is already sick and pale with grief,
	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
	Be not her maid, since she is envious;
	Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
	It is my lady; O! it is my love:
	O! that she knew she were.
	She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
	Would through the airy region stream so bright
	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
	See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand:
	O! that I were a glove upon that hand,
	That I might touch that cheek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She speaks:
	O! speak again, bright angel; for thou art
	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
	As is a winged messenger of heaven
	Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
	Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him
	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds,
	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
	Deny thy father, and refuse thy name;
	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

<DIRECTION>
Aside.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
	Thou art thyself though, not a Montague.
	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
	Belonging to a man. O! be some other name:
	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
	By any other name would smell as sweet;
	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
	And for that name, which is no part of thee,
	Take all myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take thee at thy word.
	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What man art thou, that, thus bescreen'd in night,
	So stumblest on my counsel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By a name
	I know not how to tall thee who I am:
	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
	Because it is an enemy to thee:
	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
	Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound:
	Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
	And the place death, considering who thou art,
	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
	Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they do see thee they will murder thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack! there lies more peril in thine eye
	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
	And I am proof against their enmity.

</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes;
	And but thou love me, let them find me here;
	My life were better ended by their hate,
	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Love, that first did prompt me to inquire;
	He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
	As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,
	I would adventure for such merchandise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay;'
	And I will take thy word; yet, if thou swear'st,
	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
	They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo!
	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
	I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
	And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light:
	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
	But that thou over-heard'st, ere I was 'ware,
	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
	And not impute this yielding to light love,
	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,--

	O! swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

	<DIALOGUE>

	Which is the god of my idolatry,

<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If my heart's dear love--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
	It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
	Ere one can say it lightens. Sweet, good-night!
	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
	Good-night, good-night! as sweet repose and rest
	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:

<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye
	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
	And from her womb children of divers kind
	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
	Many for many virtues excellent,
	None but for some, and yet all different.
	O! mickle is the powerful grace that lies
	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
	But to the earth some special good doth give,
	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
	And vice sometime's by action dignified.
	Within the infant rind of this weak flower
	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
	Two such opposed foes encamp them still
	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
	And where the worser is predominant,
	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benedicite!
	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
	Thou art up-rous'd by some distemperature;
	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
	I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo!
	My intercession likewise steads my foe.

	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
	And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
	By holy marriage: when and where and how
	We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here;
	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
	Jesu Maria! what a deal of brine
	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline;
	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
	Lo! here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
	And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then:
	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;

<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! she knew well
	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
	For this alliance may so happy prove,
	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

	Alas! poor Romeo, he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

	Why, what is Tybalt?

	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O! he is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom; the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah! the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay!

	Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to be-rime her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.

	Why, then, is my pump well flowered.

</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well said; follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O single-soled jest! solely singular for the singleness.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, good goose, bite not.

<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.

	And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?

	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

	Now, good sweet nurse; O Lord! why look'st thou sad?
	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
	If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news
	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<NURSE>

	I am aweary, give me leave awhile:

	Jesu! what haste? can you not stay awhile?
	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
	Let me be satisfied, is 't good or bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God. What! have you dined at home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no: but all this did I know before.
	What says he of our marriage? what of that?

</JULIET>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord! how my head aches; what a head have I!
	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
	My back o' t'other side; O! my back, my back!
	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
	To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

</JULIET>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

</NURSE>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is my mother! why, she is within;

	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,

	Hie you to church; I must another way,
	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark;
	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
	It is enough I may but call her mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These violent delights have violent ends,
	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
	Which, as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Juliet.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here comes the lady: O! so light a foot

	Ah! Juliet, if the measure of thy joy

	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
	Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
	Receive in either by this dear encounter.

</ROMEO>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:

	I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth.

Verona. A Public Place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page, and Servants.
</DIRECTION>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
	And, if we meet, we shall not 'scape a brawl;
	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when, indeed, there is no need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I like such a fellow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye, but such an eye, would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another, for tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fee-simple! O simple!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my head, here come the Capulets.

</MERCUTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Tybalt, and Others.
</DIRECTION>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Gentlemen, good den! a word with one of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consort! What! dost thou make us minstrels? an thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. 'Zounds! consort!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
	Either withdraw unto some private place,
	Or reason coldly of your grievances,
	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

</MERCUTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Romeo.
</DIRECTION>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery:
	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
	To such a greeting; villain am I none,
	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYBALT>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do protest I never injur'd thee,
	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
	And so, good Capulet, which name I tender
	As dearly as my own, be satisfied.
	</DIALOGUE>

</TYBALT>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

</ROMEO>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.

Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio.

	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,

	Away to heaven, respective lenity,

	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again
	That late thou gav'st me; for Mercutio's soul

	Staying for thine to keep him company:
	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

<BENVOLIO>

<LADY_CAPULET>

	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!

	For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
	O cousin, cousin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_CAPULET>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<BENVOLIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay:
	Romeo, that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
	How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
	Your high displeasure: all this, uttered
	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
	Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than his tongue,
	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I.
	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain,
	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENVOLIO>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
	Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_CAPULET>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend,
	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
	The life of Tybalt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And for that offence
	Immediately we do exile him hence:
	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
	That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses;
	Therefore use none; let Romeo hence in haste,
	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,

	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!
	That runaway's eyes may wink, and Romeo
	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen!
	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
	Think true love acted simple modesty.
	Come, night! come, Romeo! come, thou day in night!
	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,
	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
	Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night,
	Give me my Romeo: and, when he shall die,
	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
	That all the world will be in love with night,
	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
	O! I have bought the mansion of a love,
	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
	Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
	As is the night before some festival
	To an impatient child that hath new robes

Enter Nurse with cords.

	What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
	And that bare vowel, 'I,' shall poison more
	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
	I am not I, if there be such an 'I;'

	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
	Ah! poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
	But O! it presses to my memory,
	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds.
	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished!'
	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship,
	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
	Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
	But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
	'Romeo is banished!' to speak that word
	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
	All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished!'
	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound
	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.--

	He made you for a highway to my bed,

	Ha! banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'

<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no world without Verona walls,
	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
	Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
	And world's exile is death; then 'banished,'
	Is death mis-term'd. Calling death 'banished,'
	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
	And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
	But Romeo may not: more validity,
	More honourable state, more courtship lives
	In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
	Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
	They are free men, but I am banished.
	And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
	But 'banished' to kill me? 'Banished!'
	O friar! the damned use that word in hell;
	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
	To mangle me with that word 'banished?'
	</DIALOGUE>

</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Hold thy desperate hand:

	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote

	Unseemly woman in a seeming man;
	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
	Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,
	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
	And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
	In thes at once, which thou at once wouldst lose.
	Fie, fie! thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
	And usest none in that true use indeed
	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
	Digressing from the valour of a man;
	Thy dear love, sworn, but hollow perjury,
	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
	Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
	To set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
	What! rouse thee, man; thy Juliet is alive,
	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too:
	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend,
	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
	A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
	But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her;
	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
	Romeo is coming.

	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:

	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops:
	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:

<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O God! I have an ill-divining soul:

	Madam, I am not well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
	What! wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
	And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_CAPULET>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
	Which you weep for.

	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,

	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.

</JULIET>
<LADY_CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
	Where that same banish'd runsgate doth live;
	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_CAPULET>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
	Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
	Madam, if you could find out but a man
	To bear a poison, I would temper it,
	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
	Soon sleep in quiet. O! how my heart abhors
	To hear him nam'd, and cannot come to him,
	To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
	Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him.

	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;

</LADY_CAPULET>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by Saint Peter's church, and Peter too,
	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
	Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

	It rains downright.
	How now! a conduit, girl? what! still in tears?
	Evermore showering? In one little body
	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
	Without a sudden calm, will overset
	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

</CAPULET>
<JULIET>

	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
	I tell thee what, get thee to church o' Thursday,

	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
	My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us bless'd
	That God had lent us but this only child;

	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,

	A gentleman of noble parentage,
	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
	To answer 'I'll not wed,' 'I cannot love,'
	'I am too young,' 'I pray you, pardon me;'
	But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
	Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
	An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,

	O! he's a lovely gentleman;
	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
	I think you are happy in this second match,

	You say you do not know the lady's mind:

</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
	To stop the inundation of her tears;
	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
	May be put from her by society.
	Now do you know the reason of this haste.

<PARIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.

	The tears have got small victory by that;

	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

</JULIET>
<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Juliet, I already know thy grief;
	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
	On Thursday next be married to this county.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
	And with this knife I'll help it presently,
	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
	Shall be the label to another deed,
	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
	Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
	Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
	Give me some present counsel; or behold,
	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
	Which the commission of thy years and art
	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold, daughter; I do spy a kind of hope,
	Which craves as desperate an execution
	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
	That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;
	And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_LAURENCE>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
	With reeky shanks, and yellow chapless skulls;
	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow!
	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,
	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
	When presently through all thy veins shall run
	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou liv'st;
	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
	To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,
	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
	Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
	Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
	Then--as the manner of our country is--
	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier,
	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
	And hither shall he come; and he and I
	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
	If no unconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
	Abate thy valour in the acting it.

<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
	That almost freezes up the heat of life:
	I'll call them back again to comfort me:
	Nurse! What should she do here?
	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
	Come, vial.
	What if this mixture do not work at all?
	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
	No, no; this shall forbid it: lie thou there
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Laying down a dagger.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if it be a poison, which the friar
	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
	Because he married me before to Romeo?
	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
	I will not entertain so bad a thought.
	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
	I wake before the time that Romeo
	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
	Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
	The horrible conceit of death and night,
	Together with the terror of the place,
	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
	Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
	At some hours in the night spirits resort:
	Alack, alack! is it not like that I,
	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:
	O! if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
	Environed with all these hideous fears,
	And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
	Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary

	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think,--

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Juliet, I will he with thee to-night.
	Let's see for means: O mischief! thou art swift
	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
	I do remember an apothecary,
	And hereabouts he dwells, which late I noted
	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
	Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves
	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
	Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
	Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.

	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor;

	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
	For fear of that I still will stay with thee,

	Depart again: here, here will I remain
	With worms that are thy chambermaids; O! here

	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you

	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!

<FRIAR_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
	I married them; and their stolen marriage-day
	Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
	Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce,
	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
	And, with wild looks bid me devise some mean
	To rid her from this second marriage,
	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
	Then gave I her,--so tutor'd by my art,--
	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
	As I intended, for it wrought on her
	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
	That he should hither come as this dire night,
	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
	Return'd my letter back. Then, all alone,
	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
	But, when I came,--some minute ere the time
	Of her awakening,--here untimely lay
	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
	And bear this work of heaven with patience;
	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
	All this I know; and to the marriage
	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
	Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
	Unto the rigour of severest law.

	We still have known thee for a holy man.
	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

<BALTHASAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
	And then in post he came from Mantua
	To this same place, to this same monument.
	This letter he early bid me give his father,
	And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
	If I departed not and left him there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTHASAR>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
	Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?
	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave,
	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did;
	Anon, comes one with light to ope the tomb;
	And by and by my master drew on him;
	And then I ran away to call the watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAGE>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
	Where be these enemies?--Capulet! Montague!
	See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love;
	And I, for winking at your discords too,
	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCE>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O brother Montague! give me thy hand:
	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
	Can I demand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<MONTAGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can give thee more;
	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
	That while Verona by that name is known.
	There shall no figure at such rate be set
	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONTAGUE>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie;
	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things:
	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
	For never was a story of more woe
	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
	</DIALOGUE>
