<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
A Room of State in King Lear's Palace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.
</DIRECTION>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is not this your son, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot conceive you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came somewhat saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My services to your lordship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must love you, and sue to know you better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I shall study deserving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The king is coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Sennet. Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall, my liege.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund.
</DIRECTION>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
	In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
	To shake all cares and business from our age,
	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
	Unburden'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
	We have this hour a constant will to publish
	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
	Since now we will divest us both of rule,
	Interest of territory, cares of state,--
	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
	That we our largest bounty may extend
	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
	Our eldest-born, speak first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<GONERIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
	Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
	Beyond what can be valu'd, rich or rare;
	No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
	As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
	A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
	Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONERIL>
<CORDELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
	With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
	With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
	We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
	Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
	Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am made of that self metal as my sister,
	And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
	I find she names my very deed of love;
	Only she comes too short: that I profess
	Myself an enemy to all other joys
	Which the most precious square of sense possesses
	And find I am alone felicitate
	In your dear highness' love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGAN>
<CORDELIA>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, poor Cordelia!
	And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
	More richer than my tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To thee and thine, hereditary ever,
	Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
	No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
	Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
	Although our last, not least; to whose young love
	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
	My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
	According to my bond; nor more nor less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
	Lest you may mar your fortunes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good my lord,
	You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I
	Return those duties back as are right fit,
	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
	Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
	To love my father all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But goes thy heart with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, good my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So young, and so untender?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So young, my lord, and true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:
	For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
	The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
	By all the operation of the orbs
	From whom we do exist and cease to be,
	Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
	Propinquity and property of blood,
	And as a stranger to my heart and me
	Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
	Or he that makes his generation messes
	To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
	Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
	As thou my sometime daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good my liege,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peace, Kent!
	Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
	I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
	On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
	So be my grave my peace, as here I give
	Her father's heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?
	Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
	With my two daughters' dowers digest the third;
	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
	I do invest you jointly with my power,
	Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
	That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,
	With reservation of a hundred knights,
	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
	Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain
	The name and all th' addition to a king;
	The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
	Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
	This coronet part between you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Royal Lear,
	Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
	Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
	As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
	The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
	When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
	Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
	When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state;
	And, in thy best consideration, check
	This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
	Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
	Reverbs no hollowness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kent, on thy life, no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My life I never held but as a pawn
	To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
	Thy safety being the motive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of my sight!

</LEAR>
<KENT>

	See better, Lear; and let me still remain
	The true blank of thine eye.

	Do;

</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me, recreant!
	On thine allegiance, hear me!
	Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,--
	Which we durst never yet,--and, with strain'd pride
	To come betwixt our sentence and our power,--
	Which nor our nature nor our place can hear,--
	Our potency made good, take thy reward.
	Five days we do allot thee for provision
	To shield thee from diseases of the world;
	And, on the sixth, to turn thy hated back
	Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following
	Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
	The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
	This shall not be revok'd.

	Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Lord of Burgundy,
	We first address toward you, who with this king
	Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What, in the least,
	Will you require in present dower with her,
	Or cease your quest of love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most royal majesty,
	I crave no more than hath your highness offer'd,
	Nor will you tender less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right noble Burgundy,
	When she was dear to us we did hold her so,
	But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
	If aught within that little-seeming substance,
	Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
	And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
	She's there, and she is yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know no answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
	Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
	Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
	Take her, or leave her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<BURGANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, royal sir;
	Election makes not up on such conditions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGANDY>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
	I tell you all her wealth.-
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To France.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you, great king,
	I would not from your love make such a stray
	To match you where I hate; therefore, beseech you
	To avert your liking a more worthier way
	Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
	Almost to acknowledge hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<FRANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is most strange,
	That she, who even but now was your best object,
	The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
	The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time
	Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
	So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
	Must be of such unnatural degree
	That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
	Fall into taint; which to believe of her,
	Must be a faith that reason without miracle
	Could never plant in me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCE>
<CORDELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I yet beseech your majesty--
	If for I want that glib and oily art
	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
	I'll do 't before I speak--that you make known
	It is no vicious blot nor other foulness,
	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
	That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour,
	But even for want of that for which I am richer,
	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
	That I am glad I have not, though not to have it
	Hath lost me in your liking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORDELIA>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better thou
	Hadst not been born than not to have pleas'd me better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<FRANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it but this? a tardiness in nature
	Which often leaves the history unspoke
	That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
	What say you to the lady? Love is not love
	When it is mingled with regards that stand
	Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
	She is herself a dowry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCE>
<BURGANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Royal Lear,
	Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
	And here I take Cordelia by the hand,

<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

<FRANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
	Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
	Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
	Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
	Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
	My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
	Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
	Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
	Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
	Shall buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.
	Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
	Thou losest here, a better where to find.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCE>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast her, France; let her be thine, for we
	Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
	That face of hers again, therefore be gone
	Without our grace, our love, our benison.
	Come, noble Burgundy.

	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;

	That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.

</REGAN>
<GONERIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our sister most; and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.

</GONERIL>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGAN>
<GONERIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then, must we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed condition, but, therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONERIL>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment.

</REGAN>
<GONERIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you, let us hit together: if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.

	Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law

	Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
	When my dimensions are as well compact,
	My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
	As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
	With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
	Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
	More composition and fierce quality
	Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
	Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
	Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,
	Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
	Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
	As to the legitimate. Fine word, 'legitimate!'
	Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,

<EDMUND>

	This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, <EDGAR.--HUM! CONSPIRACY! 'SLEEP TILL I WAKED HIM, YOU...>
</GLOUCESTER>
<... SHOULD ENJOY HALF HIS REVENUE.'--MY SON EDGAR!...>

<EDMUND>

	You know the character to be your brother's?

	If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but, in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.

<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is his.

</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>

	It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents.

</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, my lord: but I have often heard him maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger.

	<DIALOGUE>
	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked between son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing: do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! 'Tis strange!

	This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit of our own behaviour,--we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. 'Sfoot! I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--

	And I for sorrow sung,
	That such a king should play bo-peep,

	Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,

	I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
	To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
	By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
	That you protect this course, and put it on
	By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
	Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,

	This admiration, sir, is much o' the favour

	Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
	Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold,
	That this our court, infected with their manners,
	Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
	Make it more like a tavern or a brothel

	For instant remedy; be then desir'd
	By her that else will take the thing she begs,
	A little to disquantity your train;

<KENT>

	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,

	That in the natures of their lords rebel;
	Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
	Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
	With every gale and vary of their masters,
	Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
	A plague upon your epileptic visage!

	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is some fellow,
	Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect
	A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
	Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
	An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth:
	An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
	These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
	Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
	Than twenty silly-ducking observants,
	That stretch their duties nicely.

</CORNWALL>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,

</KENT>
<CORNWALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What mean'st by this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNWALL>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which for my part I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<CORNWALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the offence you gave him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNWALL>
<OSWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never gave him any:
	It pleas'd the king his master very late
	To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
	When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,
	Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
	And put upon him such a deal of man,
	That worthied him, got praises of the king
	For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
	And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
	Drew on me here again.

	Sir, I am too old to learn,
	Call not your stocks for me; I serve the king,

	Against the grace and person of my master,
	Stocking his messenger.

<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
	His fault is much, and the good king his master

	I will preserve myself; and am bethought
	To take the basest and most poorest shape
	That ever penury, in contempt of man,
	Brought near to beast; my face I'll grime with filth,
	Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,
	And with presented nakedness outface
	The winds and persecutions of the sky.
	The country gives me proof and precedent
	Of Bedlam beggars, who with roaring voices,
	Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
	Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
	And with this horrible object, from low farms,
	Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
	Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
	Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygood! poor Tom!

	Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
	Which presently they read: on whose contents
	They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
	Commanded me to follow, and attend
	The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
	And meeting here the other messenger,
	Whose welcome, I perceiv'd, had poison'd mine,--
	Being the very fellow which of late
	Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
	Having more man than wit about me,--drew:

When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.

	Sir, I do know you;

	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
	Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
	Thron'd and set high--servants, who seem no less,
	Which are to France the spies and speculations
	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
	But, true it is, from France there comes a power
	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
	In some of our best ports, and are at point
	To show their open banner. Now to you:
	If on my credit you dare build so far
	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
	Some that will thank you, making just report
	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
	The king hath cause to plain.

	This office to you.

These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to the king. I will seek him and privily relieve him; go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the king, my old master, must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.

	Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
	Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
	But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip,
	When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
	How light and portable my pain seems now,
	When that which makes me bend makes the king bow;
	He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
	Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
	When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
	In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.

	Whose reverence the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
	Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
	Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
	A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
	If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
	Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
	It will come,
	Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
	Like monsters of the deep.

	Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
	France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,

<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
	Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
	To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
	Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
	But not without that harmful stroke, which since
	Hath pluck'd him after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<ALBANY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This shows you are above,

<DIRECTION>
Enter Kent and a Gentleman.
</DIRECTION>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger, that his personal return was most required and necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who hath he left behind him general?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
	Her delicate cheek; it seem'd she was a queen
	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
	Sought to be king o'er her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! then it mov'd her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove
	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
	Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
	Were like a better way; those happy smilets
	That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
	Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
	If all could so become it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made she no verbal question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of 'father'
	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
	Cried, 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
	And clamour-moisten'd, then away she started
	To deal with grief alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the stars,
	The stars above us, govern our conditions;
	Else one self mate and make could not beget
	Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	No, since.

</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, the poor distress'd Lear's i' the town,
	Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
	What we are come about, and by no means
	Will yield to see his daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, good sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
	That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
	To his dog-hearted daughters,--these things sting
	His mind so venomously that burning shame
	Detains him from Cordelia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack! poor gentleman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

</KENT>
<GENTLEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis so, they are afoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTLEMAN>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
	And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
	Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
	When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
	Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
	Along with me.

	'Tis known before; our preparation stands

</OSWALD>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Himself in person there?

<OSWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, with much ado:

<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

<REGAN>

</REGAN>
<OSWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
	It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
	To let him live; where he arrives he moves
	All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
	In pity of his misery, to dispatch
	His nighted life; moreover, to descry
	The strength o' the enemy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

	Our troops set forth to-morrow; stay with us,

	I may not, madam;
	My lady charg'd my duty in this business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
	Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
	Something--I know not what. I'll love thee much,
	Let me unseal the letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, I had rather--
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know your lady does not love her husband;
	I am sure of that: and at her late being here
	She gave strange ceilliades and most speaking looks
	To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, madam!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSWALD>
<REGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I speak in understanding; you are, I know't:
	Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
	My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,
	And more convenient is he for my hand
	Than for your lady's. You may gather more.
	If you do find him, pray you, give him this,
	And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
	I pray desire her call her wisdom to her:
	So, fare you well.
	If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
	Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REGAN>
<OSWALD>

	Would I could meet him, madam: I would show

<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When shall I come to the top of that same hill?

</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do climb up it now; look how we labour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks the ground is even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horrible steep:
	Hark! do you hear the sea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, truly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then you other senses grow imperfect
	By your eyes' anguish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So may it be, indeed.
	Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st
	In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'are much deceiv'd; in nothing am I chang'd
	But in my garments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks you're better spoken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still.
	How fearful
	And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
	The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
	Show scarce so gross as beetles; half way down
	Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
	Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
	The fishermen that walk upon the beach
	Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark
	Diminish'd to her cock, her cock a buoy
	Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,
	That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
	Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
	Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
	Topple down headlong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Set me where you stand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your hand; you are now within a foot
	Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
	Would I not leap upright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go my hand.
	Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
	Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
	Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
	Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now fare you well, good sir.

<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why I do trifle thus with his despair
	Is done to cure it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O you mighty gods!
	This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
	Shake patiently my great affliction off;
	If I could bear it longer, and not fall
	To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
	My snuff and loathed part of nature should
	Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
	Now, fellow, fare thee well.

<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away and let me die.

</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
	So many fathom down precipitating,
	Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe,
	Hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound.
	Ten masts at each make not the altitude
	Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
	Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But have I fallen or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
	Look up a-height; the shrill-gorg'd lark so far
	Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack! I have no eyes.
	Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
	To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
	When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
	And frustrate his proud will.

<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A poor unfortunate beggar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLOUCESTER>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I stood here below methought his eyes
	Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
	Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea:
	It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
	Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
	Of men's impossibilities, have preserv'd thee.

</EDGAR>
<GLOUCESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do remember now; henceforth I'll bear
	Affliction till it do cry out itself

	'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.

	Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatter'd me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are not men o' their words: they told me I was every thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, every inch a king:
	When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
	I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
	Adultery?
	Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
	The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
	Does lecher in my sight.
	Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
	Was kinder to his father than my daughters
	Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
	To 't luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
	Behold yond simpering dame,
	Whose face between her forks presageth snow;
	That minces virtue, and does shake the head
	To hear of pleasure's name;
	The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to 't
	With a more riotous appetite.
	Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
	Though women all above:
	But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
	Beneath is all the fiends':
	There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit,
	Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination: there's money for thee.

	And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority; a dog's obey'd in office.
	Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
	Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
	Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
	For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
	Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
	Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
	And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
	Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw doth pierce it.
	None does offend, none, I say none; I'll able 'em:
	Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
	To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;

	To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
	Each jealous of the other, as the stung
	Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
	Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd
	If both remain alive: to take the widow
	Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
	And hardly shall I carry out my side,
	Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use
	His countenance for the battle; which being done
	Let her who would be rid of him devise
	His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
	Which he intends to Lear, and to Cordelia,
	The battle done, and they within our power,
	Shall never see his pardon; for my state
	Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

	To pluck the common bosom on his side,
	And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
	Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
	My reason all the same; and they are ready
	To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
	Where you shall hold your session. At this time
	We sweat and bleed; the friend hath lost his friend,

	By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;

	The bloody proclamation to escape
	That follow'd me so near,--O! our lives' sweetness,
	That we the pain of death would hourly die
	Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
	Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance
	That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
	Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
	Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
	Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
	Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
	Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd;
	Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
	I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
	Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,--
	Alack! too weak the conflict to support;
	'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
	Burst smilingly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<EDMUND>

	This would have seem'd a period
	To such as love not sorrow; but another,
	To amplify too much, would make much more,
	And top extremity.
	Whilst I was big in clamour came there a man,
	Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
	Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
	Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
	He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out
	As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
	Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
	That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting
	His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
	Began to crack: twice then the trumpet sounded,
	And there I left him tranc'd.

Kneeling.

	'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

</EDGAR>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
	I might have sav'd her; now, she's gone for ever!
	Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
	What is 't thou sayst? Her voice was ever soft,
	Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.
	I kill'd the slave that was a hanging thee.

<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I not, fellow?
	I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
	I would have made them skip: I am old now,
	And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
	Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.

<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

</LEAR>
<KENT>

	The same,

	He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
	He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.

<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my good lord; I am the very man--

</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see that straight.

</LEAR>
<KENT>

<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are welcome hither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor no man else; all's cheerless, dark, and deadly:
	Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
	And desperately are dead.

</KENT>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, so I think.

<ALBANY>

	He knows not what he says, and vain it is

	Edmund is dead, my lord.

</OFFICER>
<ALBANY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's but a trifle here.
	You lords and noble friends, know our intent;
	What comfort to this great decay may come
	Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,
	During the life of this old majesty,
	To him our absolute power:-
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Edgar and Kent.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, to your rights;
	With boot and such addition as your honours
	Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
	The wages of their virtue, and all foes
	The cup of their deservings. O! see, see!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALBANY>
<LEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
	Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
	And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
	Never, never, never, never, never!
	Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
	Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
	Look there, look there!

<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look up, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vex not his ghost: O! let him pass; he hates him
	That would upon the rack of this tough world
	Stretch him out longer.

</KENT>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is gone, indeed.

</EDGAR>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wonder is he hath endur'd so long:
	He but usurp'd his life.

<ALBANY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bear them from hence. Our present business
	Is general woe
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Kent and Edgar.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends of my soul, you twain
	Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.

	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
	My master calls me, I must not say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<ALBANY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The weight of this sad time we must obey;
	Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
	The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,
	Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

Exeunt, with a dead march.
