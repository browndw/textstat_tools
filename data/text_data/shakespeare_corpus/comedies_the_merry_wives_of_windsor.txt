<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is an old coat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.

<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He hears with ear?' Why, it is affectations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<SLENDER>

	Ay, by these gloves, did he,--or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else,--of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this true, Pistol?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<PISTOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha, thou mountain foreigner!--Sir John and master mine,
	I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
	Word of denial in thy labras here!
	Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PISTOL>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<NYM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be avised, sir, and pass good humours. I will say, 'marry trap,' with you, if you run the nuthook's humour on me: that is the very note of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYM>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What say you, Scarlet and John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<BARDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, for my part, I say, the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARDOLPH>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is his 'five senses;' fie, what the ignorance is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<BARDOLPH>

	And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd; and so conclusions pass'd the careires.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARDOLPH>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no matter. I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick: if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.

	How now, Simple! Where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles about you, have you?
<SIMPLE>

	Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon All-Hallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMPLE>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere a tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here: do you understand me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable: if it be so, I shall do that that is reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but understand me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<SLENDER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country, simple though I stand here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that is not the question; the question is concerning your marriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, there's the point, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, is it, the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth: therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do, is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHALLOW>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another: I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt: but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a fery discretion answer; save, the faul is in the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our meaning, 'resolutely.' His meaning is goot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<SHALLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, I think my cousin meant well.

</ANNE>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin th' other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes;--and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, indeed, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's meat and drink to me, now: I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women, indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favoured rough things.

	No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses, she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I can construe the action of her familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be Englished rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

I will be 'cheator to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me: they shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both.

You are not young, no more am I; go to then, there's sympathy; you are merry, so am I, ha! ha! then, there's more sympathy, you love sack, and so do I, would you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page, at the least, if the love of a soldier can suffice, that I love thee I will not say, pity me,--'tis not a soldier-like phrase; but I say, love me. By me,

I shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised women's modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I think, the best way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here's the twin brother of thy letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I protest, mine never shall. I warrant, he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for different names, sure more, and these are of the second edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two: I had rather be a grantess, and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.

</MRS. FORD>
<MRS. PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.

	Boarding call you it? I'll be sure to keep him above deck.

</MRS. FORD>
<MRS. PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So will I: if he come under my hatches, I'll never to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.

</MRS. PAGE>
<MRS. FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! it would give eternal food to his jealousy.

</FORD>

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn: I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon mine honour thou hadst it not.

You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue!--you stand upon your honour!--Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of mine honour precise. I, I, I, myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour! You will not do it, you!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, this is the short and the long of it. You have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful: the best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a canary; yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly--all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all; and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUICKLY>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what says she to me? be brief, my good she Mercury.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, she hath received your letter; for the which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUICKLY>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten and eleven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet woman leads an ill life with him; he's a very jealousy man; she leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUICKLY>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship: Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too: and let me tell you in your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the other: and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home; but, she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man: surely, I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUICKLY>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not I, I assure thee: setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.

</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blessing on your heart for't!
	</DIALOGUE>

	But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That were a jest indeed! they have not so little grace, I hope: that were a trick, indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves: her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will: and, truly she deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page; no remedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUICKLY>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<QUICKLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not good that children should know any wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUICKLY>

I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.

	I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her; fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given. Briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none; unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate; and that hath taught me to say this,
	Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;

</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of what quality was your love, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a fair house built upon another man's ground; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allowed for your many war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife: use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves: I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which now are too-too strongly embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O good sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall know how I speed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not. Yet I wrong him, to call him poor: they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which his wife seems to me well-favoured. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer; and there's my harvest-home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him, if you saw him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt he with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

	What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him, the hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils' additions, the names of fiends: but Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself: then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour: I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

He pieces out his wife's inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A man may hear this shower sing in the wind: and Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots! they are laid; and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbours shall cry aim

	Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having: he kept company with the wild prince and Pointz; he is of too high a region; he knows too much.

<FALSTAFF>

	By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.

	For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you had rather:' your husband's here at hand; bethink you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.

The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies, fifteen i' the litter; and you may know by my size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking: if the bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had been drowned but that the shore was shelvy and shallow; a death that I abhor, for the water swells a man, and what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled!

</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her house the hour she appointed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how sped you, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How so, sir? did she change her determination?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Master Brook; but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provoked and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! while you were there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did he search for you, and could not find you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's approach; and in her invention, and Ford's wife's distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A buck-basket!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how long lay you there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well; on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable-fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease: think of that, a man of my kidney, think of that, that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw: it was a miracle to 'scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that, hissing hot, think of that, Master Brook!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all this. My suit then is desperate; you'll undertake her no more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALSTAFF>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis past eight already, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed, and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her: adieu. You shall have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>

Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I sleep? Master Ford, awake! awake, Master Ford! there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This 'tis to be married: this 'tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he should; he cannot creep into a half-penny purse, nor into a pepper-box; but, lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not, shall not make me tame: if I have horns to make me mad, let the proverb go with me; I'll be horn-mad

I am glad the fat knight is not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS. PAGE>
<MRS. FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, does he talk of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS. FORD>
<MRS. PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the last time he searched for him, in a basket: protests to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.

	We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as they did last time.

	A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does she? We are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling.

	There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,

	Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
	And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
	And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain
	In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
	You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
	The superstitious idle-headed eld
	Receiv'd and did deliver to our age
	This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

	Like urchins, ouphs and fairies, green and white,
	With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
	And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,
	As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met,
	Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
	With some diffused song: upon their sight,
	We two in great amazedness will fly:
	Then let them all encircle him about,
	And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight;
	And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
	In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
	In shape profane.

	Hark, good mine host:
	To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
	Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
	The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
	While other jests are something rank on foot,
	Her father hath commanded her to slip
	Away with Slender, and with him at Eton
	Immediately to marry: she hath consented:
	Now, sir,
	Her mother, even strong against that match
	And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
	That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
	While other sports are tasking of their minds;
	And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
	Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
	She, seemingly obedient, likewise hath
	Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
	Her father means she shall be all in white,
	And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
	To take her by the hand and bid her go,
	She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
	The better to denote her to the doctor,--
	For they must all be mask'd and vizarded--
	That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd,
	With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
	And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
	To pinch her by the hand; and on that token
	The maid hath given consent to go with him.

	And, in the lawful name of marrying,
	To give our hearts united ceremony.

I will tell you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of a man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste: go along with me; I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I plucked geese, played traunt, and whipped top, I knew not what it was to be beaten till lately. Follow me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the forest: send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?

	Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well said, fairy Hugh.

	I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in good English.

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'er-reaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese.

	Seese is not goot to give putter: your pelly is all putter.

<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Seese' and 'putter!' have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.

<MRS. PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?

	A puffed man?

<FORD>

	And as wicked as his wife?

</FORD>
<EVANS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVANS>
<FALSTAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use me as you will.

<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander: over and above that you have suffered, I think, to repay that money will be a biting affliction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORD>
<MRS. FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, husband, let that go to make amends;
	Forgive that sum, and so we'll all be friends.

	Well, here's my hand: all is forgiven at last.

	Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her, Master Slender hath married her daughter.

	Of what, son?

</PAGE>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she's a great lubberly boy: if it had not been i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! and 'tis a postmaster's boy.

	Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.

</PAGE>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLENDER>
<PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAGE>
<SLENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to her in white, and cried, 'mum,' and she cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

<MRS. PAGE>

	Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.

	Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha' married un garçon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

<MRS. PAGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, did you not take her in green?

	Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?

<MRS. PAGE>

	Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS. PAGE>
<FENTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
	You would have married her most shamefully,
	Where there was no proportion held in love.
	The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
	Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
	The offence is holy that she hath committed,
	And this deceit loses the name of craft,
	Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
	Since therein she doth evitate and shun
	A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
	Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FENTON>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand not amaz'd: here is no remedy:
	In love the heavens themselves do guide the state:
	Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

	I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.

	Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
	Heaven give you many, many merry days!
	Good husband, let us every one go home,
	And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
	Sir John and all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS. PAGE>
<FORD>

	Let it be so. Sir John,
	To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word;
