Scene.--In several parts of the Roman Empire.

<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Alexandria. A Room in Cleopatra's Palace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Demetrius and Philo.
</DIRECTION>
<PHILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but this dotage of our general's
	O'erflows the measure; those his goodly eyes,
	That o'er the files and musters of the war
	Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
	The office and devotion of their view
	Upon a tawny front; his captain's heart,
	Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
	The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
	And is become the bellows and the fan
	To cool a gipsy's lust. Look! where they come
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Flourish. Enter Antony and Cleopatra, with their Trains; Eunuchs fanning her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take but good note, and you shall see in him
	The triple pillar of the world transform'd
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILO>
	Into a strumpet's fool; behold and see.
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<DIRECTION>
Enter an Attendant.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	News, my good lord, from Rome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grates me; the sum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, hear them, Antony:
	Fulvia, perchance, is angry; or, who knows
	If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
	His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
	Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
	Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How, my love!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perchance! nay, and most like;
	You must not stay here longer; your dismission
	Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
	Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
	Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
	Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
	Is Caesar's homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
	When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
	Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
	Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
	Feeds beast as man; the nobleness of life
	Is to do thus; when such a mutual pai
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Embracing.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And such a twain can do 't, in which I bind,
	On pain of punishment, the world to weet
	We stand up peerless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent falsehood!
	Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her?
	I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
	Will be himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
	Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
	Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
	There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
	Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear the ambassadors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, wrangling queen!
	Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
	To weep; whose every passion fully strives
	To make itself, in thee, fair and admir'd.
	No messenger, but thine; and all alone,
	To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
	The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
	Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra, with their Train.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMETRIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMETRIUS>
<PHILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
	He comes too short of that great property
	Which still should go with Antony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILO>
<DEMETRIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am full sorry
	That he approves the common liar, who
	Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
	Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMETRIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Same. Another Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Charmian, Iras, Alexas, and a Soothsayer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? O! that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soothsayer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In nature's infinite book of secrecy
	A little I can read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show him your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Enobarbus.
</DIRECTION>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
	Cleopatra's health to drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good sir, give me good fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I make not, but foresee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray then, foresee me one.

<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall be more beloving than belov'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, hear him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all; let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage; find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
	Than that which is to approach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, belike, my children shall have no names; prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If every of your wishes had a womb,
	And fertile every wish, a million.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll know all our fortunes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be,--drunk to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<IRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	E'en as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.
	Prithee, tell her but a worky-day fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your fortunes are alike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<IRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how? but how? give me particulars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRAS>
<SOOTHSAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOOTHSAYER>
<IRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in my husband's nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our worser thoughts heaven mend! Alexas,--come, his fortune, his fortune. O! let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee; and let her die too, and give him a worse; and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<IRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! for, as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRAS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARMIAN>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lo, now! if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, but they'd do't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush! here comes Antony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not he; the queen.

</CHARMIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Cleopatra.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw you my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>

	Was he not here?

</CLEOPATRA>
<CHARMIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, madam.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
	A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>

Enter Antony, with a Messenger and Attendants.

	We will not look upon him; go with us.

<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

</MESSENGER>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Against my brother Lucius?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay:
	But soon that war had end, and the time's state
	Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
	Whose better issue in the war, from Italy
	Upon the first encounter drave them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what worst?

</MARK_ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>

	The nature of bad news infects the teller.

	When it concerns the fool, or coward. On;
	Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
	Who tells me true, though in his tale lay death,
	I hear him as he flatter'd.

</MARK_ANTONY>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Labienus--
	This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force
	Extended Asia; from Euphrates
	His conquering banner shook from Syria

<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue;
	Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
	Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
	With such full licence as both truth and malice
	Have power to utter. O! then we bring forth weeds
	When our quick winds lie still; and our ills told us
	Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

Enter another Messenger.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you?
<MESSENGER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fulvia thy wife is dead.

<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where died she?

<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forbear me
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Second Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
	What our contempts do often hurl from us
	We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
	By revolution lowering, does become
	The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
	The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
	I must from this enchanting queen break off;
	Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
	My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Enobarbus.
</DIRECTION>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your pleasure, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must with haste from hence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must be gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under a compelling occasion let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is cunning past man's thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack! sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I had never seen her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, sir! you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fulvia is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fulvia is dead.

</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fulvia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The business she hath broached in the state
	Cannot endure my absence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more light answers. Let our officers Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
	The cause of our expedience to the queen,
	And get her leave to part. For not alone
	The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
	Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too
	Of many our contriving friends in Rome
	Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
	Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
	The empire of the sea; our slippery people--
	Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
	Till his deserts are past--begin to throw
	Pompey the Great and all his dignities
	Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
	Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
	For the main soldier, whose quality, going on,
	The sides o' the world may danger. Much is breeding,
	Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
	And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
	To such whose place is under us, requires
	Our quick remove from hence.

<CLEOPATRA>

	See where he is, who's with him, what he does;

Exit Alexas.

</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, stand further from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
	What says the married woman? You may go:
	Would she had never given you leave to come!
	Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here;
	I have no power upon you; hers you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gods best know,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! never was there queen
	So mightily betray'd; yet at the first
	I saw the treasons planted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cleopatra,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I think you can be mine and true,
	Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
	Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
	To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
	Which break themselves in swearing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most sweet queen,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
	But bid farewell, and go: when you su'd staying
	Then was the time for words; no going then:
	Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
	Bliss in our brows bent; none our parts so poor
	But was a race of heaven; they are so still,
	Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
	Art turn'd the greatest liar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, lady!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
	There were a heart in Egypt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me, queen:
	The strong necessity of time commands
	Our services awhile, but my full heart
	Remains in use with you. Our Italy
	Shines o'er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
	Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
	Equality of two domestic powers
	Breeds scrupulous faction. The hated, grown to strength,
	Are newly grown to love; the condemn'd Pompey,
	Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
	Into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
	Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
	And quietness, grown aick of rest, would purge
	By any desperate change. My more particular,
	And that which most with you should safe my going,
	Is Fulvia's death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
	It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dead, my queen:
	Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
	The garboils she awak'd; at the last, best,
	See when and where she died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O most false love!
	Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
	With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
	In Fulvia's death, how mine receiv'd shall be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
	The purposes I bear, which are or cease
	As you shall give the advice. By the fire
	That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
	Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
	As thou affect'st.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
	But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well;
	So Antony loves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My precious queen, forbear,
	And give true evidence to his love which stands
	An honourable trial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Fulvia told me.
	I prithee, turn aside and weep for her;
	Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
	Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
	Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
	Like perfect honour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll heat my blood; no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by my sword,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And target. Still he mends;
	But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
	How this Herculean Roman does become
	The carriage of his chafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll leave you, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Courteous lord, one word.
	Sir, you and I must part, but that 's not it:
	Sir, you and I have lov'd, but there 's not it;
	That you know well: something it is I would,--
	O! my oblivion is a very Antony,
	And I am all forgotten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that your royalty
	Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
	For idleness itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis sweating labour
	To bear such idleness so near the heart
	As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
	Since my becomings kill me when they do not
	Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
	Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
	And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
	Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
	Be strew'd before your feet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us go. Come;
	Our separation so abides and flies,
	That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
	And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
	Away!

<SCENE_4>
<DIRECTION>
Rome. A Room in Caesar's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Octavius Caesar, Lepidus, and Attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
	It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
	Our great competitor. From Alexandria
	This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
	The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
	Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
	More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
	Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners: you shall find there
	A man who is the abstract of all faults
	That all men follow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must not think there are
	Evils enow to darken all his goodness;
	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
	More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
	Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
	Than what he chooses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are too indulgent. Let us grant it is not
	Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
	To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
	To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
	With knaves that smell of sweat; say this becomes him,--
	As his composure must be rare indeed
	Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
	No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
	So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
	His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
	Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
	Call on him for 't; but to confound such time
	That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
	As his own state and ours, 'tis to be chid
	As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
	Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
	And so rebel to judgment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's more news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
	Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
	How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
	And it appears he is belov'd of those
	That only have fear'd Caesar; to the ports
	The discontents repair, and men's reports
	Give him much wrong'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have known no less.
	It hath been taught us from the primal state,
	That he which is was wish'd until he were;
	And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
	Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
	Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
	Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
	To rot itself with motion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caesar, I bring thee word,
	Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
	Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
	With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
	They make in Italy; the borders maritime
	Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt;
	No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
	Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
	Than could his war resisted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Antony,
	Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
	Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
	Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
	Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,
	Though daintily brought up, with patience more
	Than savages could suffer; thou didst drink
	The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
	Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign
	The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
	Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
	The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
	It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
	Which some did die to look on; and all this--
	It wounds thy honour that I speak it now--
	Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
	So much as lank'd not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis pity of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let his shames quickly
	Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
	Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
	Assemble me immediate council; Pompey
	Thrives in our idleness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow, Caesar,
	I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
	Both what by sea and land I can be able
	To front this present time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Till which encounter,
	It is my business too. Farewell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
	Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
	To let me be partaker.

<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou, eunuch Mardian!

</CLEOPATRA>
<MARDIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What 's your highness' pleasure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARDIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
	In aught a eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee,
	That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
	May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARDIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, gracious madam.

</MARDIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARDIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
	But what in deed is honest to be done;
	Yet have I fierce affections, and think
	What Venus did with Mars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARDIAN>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Charmian!
	Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
	Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
	Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
	The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
	And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
	Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
	For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
	With most delicious poison. Think on me,
	That am with Phœbus' amorous pinches black,
	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
	When thou wast here above the ground I was
	A morsel for a monarch, and great Pompey
	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
	There would he anchor his aspect and die
	With looking on his life.

<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>

	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
	Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
	With his tinct gilded thee.
	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last thing he did, dear queen,
	He kiss'd, the last of many doubled kisses,
	This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine ear must pluck it thence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Good friend,' quoth he,
	'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
	This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
	To mend the petty present, I will piece
	Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
	Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
	And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
	Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
	Was beastly dumb'd by him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! was he sad or merry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<ALEXAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
	Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXAS>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O well-divided disposition! Note him,
	Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
	He was not sad, for he would shire on those
	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
	Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
	In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
	O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
	The violence of either thee becomes,
	So does it no man else. Mett'st thou my posts?

	Who's born that day

<POMPEIUS>

	I shall do well:

	My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
	Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
	In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
	No wars without doors; Caesar gets money where

	Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
	Nor either cares for him.

</VARRIUS>
<POMPEIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could have given less matter
	A better ear. Menas, I did not think
	This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
	For such a petty war; his soldiership
	Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
	The higher our opinion, that our stirring

	The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POMPEIUS>
<MENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot hope
	Caesar and Antony shall well greet together;

	Not mov'd by Antony.

	I know not, Menas,
	How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
	Were 't not that we stand up against them all
	'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,
	For they have entertained cause enough
	To draw their swords; but how the fear of us
	May cement their divisions and bind up
	The petty difference, we yet not know.
	Be it as our gods will have 't! It only stands

<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noble friends,
	That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
	A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
	May it be gently heard; when we debate
	Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
	Murder in healing wounds; then, noble partners,--
	The rather for I earnestly beseech,--
	Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
	Nor curstness grow to the matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis spoken well.
	Were we before our armies, and to fight,
	I should do thus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Rome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
	Or being, concern you not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must be laugh'd at
	If, or for nothing or a little, I
	Should say myself offended, and with you
	Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
	Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
	It not concern'd me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My being in Egypt, Caesar,
	What was 't to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more than my residing here at Rome
	Might be to you in Egypt; yet, if you there
	Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
	Might be my question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How intend you, practis'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
	By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
	Made wars upon me, and their contestation
	Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do mistake your business; my brother never
	Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
	And have my learning from some true reports,
	That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
	Discredit my authority with yours,
	And make the wars alike against my stomach,
	Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
	Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
	As matter whole you n' have to make it with,
	It must not be with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You praise yourself
	By laying defects of judgment to me, but
	You patch'd up your excuses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so, not so;
	I know you could not lack, I am certain on 't,
	Very necessity of this thought, that I,
	Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
	Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
	Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
	I would you had her spirit in such another:
	The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle
	You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
	Made out of her impatience,--which not wanted
	Shrewdness of policy too,--I grieving grant
	Did you too much disquiet; for that you must
	But say I could not help it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote to you
	When rioting in Alexandria; you
	Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
	Did gibe my missive out of audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir,
	He fell upon me, ere admitted: then
	Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
	Of what I was i' the morning; but next day
	I told him of myself, which was as much
	As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
	Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
	Out of our question wipe him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have broken
	The article of your oath, which you shall never
	Have tongue to charge me with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft, Caesar!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No,
	Lepidus, let him speak:
	The honour's sacred which he talks on now,
	Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar;
	The article of my oath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
	The which you both denied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neglected, rather;
	And then, when poison'd hours had bound me up
	From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
	I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
	Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
	Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
	To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
	For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
	So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
	To stoop in such a case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis noble spoken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEPIDUS>
<MECAENAS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not much dislike the matter, but
	The manner of his speech; for it cannot be
	We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
	So differing in their acts. Yet, if I knew
	What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
	O' the world I would pursue it.

</CAESAR>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me leave, Caesar.

<CAESAR>

	Speak, Agrippa.

</CAESAR>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
	Admir'd Octavia; great Mark Antony
	Is now a widower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say not so, Agrippa:
	If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
	Were well deserv'd of rashness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not married, Caesar; let me hear
	Agrippa further speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hold you in perpetual amity,
	To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
	With an unslipping knot, take Antony
	Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
	No worse a husband than the best of men,
	Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
	That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
	All little jealousies which now seem great,
	And all great fears which now import their dangers,
	Would then be nothing; truths would be but tales
	Where now half tales be truths; her love to both
	Would each to other and all loves to both
	Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,
	For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
	By duty ruminated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will Caesar speak?

	With what is spoke already.

	To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
	Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand;

	The heart of brothers govern in our loves
	And sway our great designs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is my hand.

	Fly off our loves again!

	Happily, amen!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Enobarbus!

	We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by 't in
	Egypt.

</MECAENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night light with drinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there; is this true?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECAENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will tell you.
	The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
	Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold,
	Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that
	The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,
	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
	The water which they beat to follow faster,
	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
	It beggar'd all description; she did lie
	In her pavilion,--cloth-of-gold of tissue,--
	O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
	The fancy outwork nature; on each side her
	Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
	With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
	And what they undid did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! rare for Antony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
	So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
	And made their bends adornings; at the helm
	A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle
	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
	That yarely frame the office. From the barge
	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
	Her people out upon her, and Antony,
	Enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
	Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
	And made a gap in nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rare Egyptian!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
	Invited her to supper; she replied
	It should be better he became her guest,
	Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
	Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
	Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
	And, for his ordinary pays his heart
	For what his eyes eat only.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Royal wench!
	She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;
	He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw her once
	Hop forty paces through the public street;
	And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted
	That she did make defect perfection,
	And, breathless, power breathe forth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Antony must leave her utterly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECAENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never; he will not:
	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
	Her infinite variety; other women cloy
	The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
	Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
	Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
	Bless her when she is riggish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
	The heart of Antony, Octavia is
	A blessed lottery to him.

	And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
	The actor may plead pardon. I 'll none now.
	Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there--
	My music playing far off--I will betray
	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
	Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,

<CLEOPATRA>

	Antony's dead! if thou say so, villain,
	Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
	If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
	My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings

<MESSENGER>

	First, madam, he is well.

	Why, there's more gold.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good madam, hear me.

</MESSENGER>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, go to, I will;
	But there's no goodness in thy face; if Antony

	Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
	Not like a formal man.

	I do not like 'but yet,' it does allay

	Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
	Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,

	In state of health, thou sayst; and thou sayst, free.

	To you all three,
	The senators alone of this great world,
	Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
	Wherefore my father should revengers want,
	Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
	Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
	There saw you labouring for him. What was 't
	That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
	Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
	With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
	To drench the Capitol, but that they would
	Have one man but a man? And that is it
	Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
	The anger'd ocean foams, with which I meant
	To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
	Cast on my noble father.

<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what may follow,
	To try a larger fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<POMPEIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have made me offer
	Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
	Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
	Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
	To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
	Our targets undinted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POMPEIUS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's our offer.

</LEPIDUS>
<POMPEIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know, then,
	I came before you here a man prepar'd
	To take this offer; but Mark Antony
	Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
	The praise of it by telling, you must know,
	When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
	Your mother came to Sicily and did find
	Her welcome friendly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POMPEIUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>

<LEPIDUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well met here.

	That will I, Pompey.

</MARK_ANTONY>
<POMPEIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Antony, take the lot:
	But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
	Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
	Grew fat with feasting there.

<MARK_ANTONY>

	You have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MENAS>

</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.

	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so too; but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

	Who would not have his wife so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENAS>
<ENOBARBUS>

	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then, shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.

<SILIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noble Ventidius,
	Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
	The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
	Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
	The routed fly; so thy grand captain Antony
	Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
	Put garlands on thy head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SILIUS>
<VENTIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Silius, Silius!
	I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
	May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius,
	Better to leave undone than by our deed
	Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
	Caesar and Antony have ever won
	More in their officer than person; Sossius,
	One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
	For quick accumulation of renown,
	Which he achiev'd by the minute, lost his favour.
	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
	Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
	The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
	Than gain which darkens him.
	I could do more to do Antonius good,
	But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
	Should my performance perish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VENTIDIUS>
<SILIUS>

<VENTIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll humbly signify what in his name,
	That magical word of war, we have effected;

	The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
	We have jaded out o' the field.

<MESSENGER>

	Brown, madam; and her forehead

<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,
	That were excusable, that, and thousands more
	Of semblable import, but he hath wag'd
	New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
	To public ear:
	Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not
	But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
	He vented them; most narrow measure lent me;
	When the best hint was given him, he not took 't,
	Or did it from his teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<OCTAVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O my good lord!
	Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
	Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
	If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
	Praying for both parts:
	The good gods will mock me presently,
	When I shall pray, 'O! bless my lord and husband;'
	Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
	'O! bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
	Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
	'Twixt these extremes at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OCTAVIA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentle Octavia,
	Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
	Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour
	I lose myself; better I were not yours
	Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
	Yourself shall go between's; the mean time, lady,
	I'll raise the preparation of a war
	Shall stain your brother; make your soonest haste,
	So your desires are yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<OCTAVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks to my lord.
	The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
	Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
	As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
	Should solder up the rift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OCTAVIA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it appears to you where this begins,
	Turn your displeasure that way; for our faults
	Can never be so equal that your love
	Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
	Choose your own company, and command what cost
	Your heart has mind to.

<ENOBARBUS>

</ENOBARBUS>
<EROS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

<ENOBARBUS>

	This is old: what is the success?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<EROS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

<ENOBARBUS>

	Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;

<DIRECTION>
Enter Caesar, Agrippa, and Mecaenas.
</DIRECTION>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
	In Alexandria; here's the manner of 't;
	I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
	Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
	Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
	Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
	And all the unlawful issue that their lust
	Since then hath made between them. Unto her
	He gave the 'stablishment of Egypt; made her
	Of Lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
	Absolute queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This in the public eye?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECAENAS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
	His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings;
	Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
	He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
	Syria, Cilicia, and Phœnicia. She
	In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
	That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
	As 'tis reported, so.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Let Rome be thus
	Informed.

	Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

<CAESAR>

	The people know it; and have now receiv'd
	His accusations.

</CAESAR>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whom does he accuse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
	Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
	His part o' the isle; then does he say, he lent me
	Some shipping unrestor'd; lastly, he frets
	That Lepidus of the triumvirate
	Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
	All his revenue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<AGRIPPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, this should be answer'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGRIPPA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
	I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
	That he his high authority abus'd,
	And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
	I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
	And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
	Demand the like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll never yield to that.

<OCTAVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OCTAVIA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
	Like Caesar's sister; the wife of Antony
	Should have an army for an usher, and
	The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
	Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
	Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
	Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
	Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
	Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
	A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
	The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
	Is often left unlov'd: we should have met you
	By sea and land, supplying every stage
	With an augmented greeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<OCTAVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good my lord,
	To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
	On my free-will. My lord, Mark Antony,
	Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
	My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
	His pardon for return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OCTAVIA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which soon he granted,
	Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<OCTAVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not say so, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OCTAVIA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have eyes upon him,
	And his affairs come to me on the wind.
	Where is he now?

<OCTAVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, in Athens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OCTAVIA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my most wrong'd sister; Cleopatra
	Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
	Up to a whore; who now are levying
	The kings o' the earth for war. He hath assembled
	Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus,
	Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
	Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
	King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
	Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King

	With a more larger list of sceptres.

</OCTAVIA>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome hither:
	Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
	Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
	And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
	Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
	O'er your content these strong necessities,
	But let determin'd things to destiny
	Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
	Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
	Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
	To do you justice, make their ministers
	Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
	And ever welcome to us.

	Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;

</CANIDIUS>
<ENOBARBUS>

	Your ships are not well mann'd;

	Most worthy sir, you therein throw away

	Antony only, that would make his will

	Frighted each other, why should he follow?
	The itch of his affection should not then
	Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good my lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been a boggler ever:
	But when we in our viciousness grow hard,--
	O misery on 't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
	In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
	Adore our errors; laugh at 's while we strut
	To our confusion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! is't come to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found you as a morsel, cold upon
	Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
	Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
	Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
	Luxuriously pick'd out; for, I am sure,
	Though you can guess what temperance should be,
	You know not what it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To let a fellow that will take rewards
	And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
	My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
	And plighter of high hearts. O! that I were
	Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
	The horned herd; for I have savage cause;
	And to proclaim it civilly were like
	A halter'd neck, which does the hangman thank
	For being yare about him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Attendants, with Thyreus.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he whipp'd?
<ATTENDANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soundly, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT_1>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ATTENDANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did ask favour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT_1>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that thy father live, let him repent
	Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
	To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
	Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth,
	The white hand of a lady fever thee,
	Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
	Tell him thy entertainment; look, thou say
	He makes me angry with him; for he seems
	Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
	Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
	And at this time most easy 'tis to do 't,
	When my good stars, that were my former guides,
	Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
	Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
	My speech and what is done, tell him he has
	Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
	He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
	As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
	Hence with thy stripes; be gone!

Exit Thyreus.

<CLEOPATRA>

<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack! our terrene moon
	Is now eclips'd; and it portends alone
	The fall of Antony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must stay his time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
	With one that ties his points?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not know me yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold-hearted toward me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! dear, if I be so,
	From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
	And poison it in the source; and the first stone
	Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
	Dissolve my life. The next Caesarion smite,
	Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
	Together with my brave Egyptians all,
	By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
	Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
	Have buried them for prey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am satisfied.
	Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
	I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
	Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
	Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
	Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
	If from the field I shall return once more
	To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
	I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
	There's hope in 't yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my brave lord!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will betreble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
	And fight maliciously; for when mine hours
	Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
	Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
	And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
	Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
	All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
	Let's mock the midnight bell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<CLEOPATRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is my birth-day:
	I had thought to have held it poor; but, since my lord
	Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We will yet do well.

	Call all his noble captains to my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEOPATRA>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
	The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
	There's sap in 't yet. The next time I do fight
	I'll make death love me, for I will contend
	Even with his pestilent scythe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt all but Enobarbus.
</DIRECTION>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
	Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
	The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
	A diminution in our captain's brain
	Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason
	It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
	Some way to leave him

Enter Caesar, reading a letter; Agrippa, Mecaenas, and Others.
</DIRECTION>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
	To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
	He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
	Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
	I have many other ways to die; meantime
	Laugh at his challenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<MECAENAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caesar must think,
	When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
	Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
	Make boot of his distraction: never anger
	Made good guard for itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECAENAS>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let our best heads
	Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
	We mean to fight. Within our files there are,
	Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late,
	Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
	And feast the army; we have store to do 't,
	And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow, soldier,
	By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,

	Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	And thou art honest too.
	I wish I could be made so many men,

	Tend me to-night;
	May be it is the period of your duty:
	Haply, you shall not see me more; or if,
	A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
	You'll serve another master. I look on you
	As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
	I turn you not away; but, like a master
	Married to your good service, stay till death.
	Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
	And the gods yield you for 't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK_ANTONY>
<ENOBARBUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What mean you, sir,
	To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
	And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd: for shame,
	Transform us not to women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENOBARBUS>
<MARK_ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ho, ho, ho!
	Now, the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
	Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
	You take me in too dolorous a sense,
	For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
	To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
	I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
	Where rather I'll expect victorious life
	Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,

</CAESAR>
<DERCETAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am call'd Dercetas;
	Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
	Best to be serv'd; whilst he stood up and spoke
	He was my master, and I wore my life
	To spend upon his haters. If thou please

	I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,

<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The breaking of so great a thing should make
	A greater crack; the round world

	Is not a single doom; in the name lay
	A moiety of the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<DERCETAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is dead, Caesar;
	Not by a public minister of justice,
	Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
	Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
	Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
	Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
	I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
	With his most noble blood.

	In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
	With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
	That thou, my brother, my competitor
	In top of all design, my mate in empire,
	Friend and companion in the front of war,
	The arm of mine own body, and the heart

</EGYPTIAN>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bid her have good heart;

	His legs besfrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
	Crested the world; his voice was propertied
	As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
	But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
	He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
	There was no winter in 't, an autumn 'twas
	That grew the more by reaping; his delights
	Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above
	The element they liv'd in; in his livery

	You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
	But, if there be, or ever were, one such,

	I found her trimming up the diadem
	On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
	And on the sudden dropp'd.

<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O noble weakness!
	If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
	By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
	As she would catch another Antony
	In her strong toil of grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAESAR>
<DOLABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, on her breast,
	There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
	The like is on her arm.

<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
	Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
	Upon the caves of Nile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<CAESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most probable
	That so she died; for her physician tells me
	She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
	Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
	And bear her women from the monument.
	She shall be buried by her Antony:
	No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
	A pair so famous. High events as these
	Strike those that make them; and their story is
	No less in pity than his glory which
	Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall,
	In solemn show, attend this funeral,
	And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
	High order in this great solemnity.
