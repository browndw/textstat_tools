Scene.--Rome and the Neighbourhood; Corioli and the Neighbourhood; Antium.

<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Rome. A Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak, speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Resolved, resolved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know't, we know't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. Is't a verdict?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more talking on't; let it be done.
	Away, away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One word, good citizens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity, while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear: the leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularise their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider you what services he has done for his country?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well; and could be content to give him good report for't, but that he pays himself with being proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but speak not maliciously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother, and to be partly proud; which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations: he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shouts within.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shouts are these? The other side o' the city is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft! who comes here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Menenius Agrippa.
</DIRECTION>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved the people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
	With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we have strong arms too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
	Will you undo yourselves?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you, friends, most charitable care
	Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
	Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
	Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
	Against the Roman state, whose course will on
	The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
	Of more strong link asunder than can ever
	Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
	The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
	Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack!
	You are transported by calamity
	Thither where more attends you; and you slander
	The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
	When you curse them as enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us yet: suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either you must
	Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
	Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you
	A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
	But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
	To scale't a little more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale; but, an't please you, deliver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a time when all the body's members
	Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
	That only like a gulf it did remain
	I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
	Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
	Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
	Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
	And, mutually participate, did minister
	Unto the appetite and affection common
	Of the whole body. The belly answer'd,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I shall tell you.--With a kind of smile,
	Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
	For, look you, I may make the belly smile
	As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
	To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
	That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
	As you malign our senators for that
	They are not such as you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your belly's answer? What!
	The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
	The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
	Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
	With other muniments and petty helps
	In this our fabric, if that they--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What then?--
	'Fore me, this fellow speaks! what then? what then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
	Who is the sink o' the body,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The former agents, if they did complain,
	What could the belly answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will tell you;
	If you'll bestow a small, of what you have little,
	Patience a while, you'll hear the belly's answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're long about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Note me this, good friend;
	Your most grave belly was deliberate,
	Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
	'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
	'That I receive the general food at first,
	Which you do live upon; and fit it is;
	Because I am the store-house and the shop
	Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
	I send it through the rivers of your blood,
	Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
	And, through the cranks and offices of man,
	The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
	From me receive that natural competency
	Whereby they live. And though that all at once,
	You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir; well, well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Though all at once cannot
	See what I do deliver out to each,
	Yet I can make my audit up, that all
	From me do back receive the flour of all,
	And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an answer: how apply you this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The senators of Rome are this good belly,
	And you the mutinous members; for, examine
	Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
	Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
	No public benefit which you receive
	But it proceeds or comes from them to you,
	And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
	You, the great toe of this assembly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I the great toe? Why the great toe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
	Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
	Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
	Lead'st first to win some vantage.
	But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
	Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
	The one side must have bale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Caius Marcius.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hail, noble Marcius!
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.--What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
	That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
	Make yourselves scabs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have ever your good word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He that will give good words to thee will flatter
	Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
	That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
	The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
	Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
	Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
	Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
	Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is,
	To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
	And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
	Deserves your hate; and your affections are
	A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
	Which would increase his evil. He that depends
	Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
	And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
	With every minute you do change a mind,
	And call him noble that was now your hate,
	Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
	That in these several places of the city
	You cry against the noble senate, who,
	Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
	Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For corn at their own rates; whereof they say
	The city is well stor'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang 'em! They say!
	They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
	What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
	Who thrives, and who declines; side factions, and give out
	Conjectural marriages; making parties strong,
	And feebling such as stand not in their liking,
	Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
	Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
	And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
	With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
	As I could pick my lance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
	For though abundantly they lack discretion,
	Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
	What says the other troop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are dissolv'd: hang 'em!
	They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs:
	That hunger broke stone walls; that dogs must eat;
	That meat was made for mouths; that the gods sent not
	Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
	They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
	And a petition granted them, a strange one,--
	To break the heart of generosity,
	And make bold power look pale,--they threw their caps
	As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
	Shouting their emulation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is granted them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
	Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
	Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
	The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
	Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
	Win upon power, and throw forth greater themes
	For insurrection's arguing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go; get you home, you fragments!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Messenger, hastily.
</DIRECTION>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Caius Marcius?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here: what's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
	Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Cominius, Titus Lartius, and other Senators; Junius Brutus and Sicinius Velutus.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
	The Volsces are in arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have a leader,
	Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
	I sin in envying his nobility,
	And were I anything but what I am,
	I would wish me only he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have fought together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were half to half the world by the ears, and he
	Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
	Only my wars with him: he is a lion
	That I am proud to hunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, worthy Marcius,
	Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is your former promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, it is;
	And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
	Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
	What! art thou stiff? stand'st out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Caius Marcius;
	I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
	Ere stay behind this business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARTIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! true-bred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your company to the Capitol; where I know
	Our greatest friends attend us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<LARTIUS>
<DIRECTION>
To Cominius.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lead you on
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Marcius.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
	Right worthy you priority.

<DIRECTION>
To the Citizens.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hence! to your homes! be gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, let them follow:
	The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
	To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
	Your valour puts well forth; pray, follow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Senators, Cominius, Marcius, Titus, and Menenius. Citizens steal away.
</DIRECTION>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has no equal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but his taunts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.

</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bemock the modest moon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The present wars devour him; he is grown
	Too proud to be so valiant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such a nature,
	Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
	Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
	His insolence can brook to be commanded
	Under Cominius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fame, at the which he aims,
	In whom already he is well grac'd, cannot
	Better be held nor more attain'd than by
	A place below the first; for what miscarries
	Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
	To the utmost of a man; and giddy censure
	Will then cry out of Marcius 'O! if he
	Had borne the business.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, if things go well,
	Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
	Of his demerits rob Cominius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come:
	Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
	Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
	To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
	In aught he merit not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hence and hear
	How the dispatch is made; and in what fashion,
	More than his singularity, he goes
	Upon this present action.

Enter Tullus Aufidius and Senators.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
	That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels,
	And know how we proceed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it not yours?
	What ever have been thought on in this state,
	That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
	Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
	Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
	I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
	They have press'd a power, but it is not known
	Whether for east, or west: the dearth is great;
	The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
	Cominius, Marcius, your old enemy,--
	Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,--
	And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
	These three lead on this preparation
	Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
	Consider of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUFIDIUS>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our army's in the field:
	We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
	To answer us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor did you think it folly
	To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
	They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
	It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery
	We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
	To take in many towns ere almost Rome
	Should know we were afoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUFIDIUS>
<SENATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noble Aufidius,
	Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
	Let us alone to guard Corioli:
	If they set down before's, for the remove
	Bring up your army; but, I think you'll find
	They've not prepared for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_2>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! doubt not that;
	I speak from certainties. Nay, more;
	Some parcels of their power are forth already,
	And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
	If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
	'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
	Till one can do no more.

</AUFIDIUS>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Enter Volumnia and Virgilia: they set them down on two low stools and sew.
</DIRECTION>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how honour would become such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

<DIRECTION>
Enter a Gentlewoman.

<GENTLEWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

</GENTLEWOMAN>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, you shall not.
	Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
	See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
	As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
	Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
	'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
	Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
	With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
	Like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow
	Or all or lose his hire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His bloody brow! O Jupiter! no blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
	Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
	When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
	Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
	At Grecian swords, contemning. Tell Valeria
	We are fit to bid her welcome.

<DIRECTION>
Exit Gentlewoman.

<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

	I am glad to see your ladyship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VALERIA>

<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O' my word, the father's son; I'll swear 'tis a very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o' Wednesday half an hour together: he has such a confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it, he let it go again; and after it again; and over and over he comes, and up again; catched it again: or whether his fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it; O! I warrant, how he mammocked it!

	Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not out of doors!

<VOLUMNIA>

	She shall, she shall.

</VOLUMNIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie! you confine yourself most unreasonably. Come; you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

	Why, I pray you?

<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would be another Penelope; yet, they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, good madam, there can be none yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, madam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: The Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every thing hereafter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGILIA>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her alone, lady: as she is now she will but disease our better mirth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<VALERIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In troth, I think she would. Fare you well then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o' door, and go along with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIA>
<VIRGILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much mirth.

	Well then, farewell.

Enter, with drum and colours, Marcius, Titus Lartius, Officers, and Soldiers. To them a Messenger.

<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yonder comes news: a wager they have met.

</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My horse to yours, no.

</LARTIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis done.

</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agreed.

</LARTIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, has our general met the enemy?

</MARCIUS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the good horse is mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARTIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll buy him of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
	For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARTIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far off lie these armies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Within this mile and half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
	Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
	That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
	To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
A Parley sounded. Enter, on the Walls, two Senators, and Others.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
	That's lesser than a little. Hark, our drum
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drums afar off.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are bringing forth our youth: we'll break our walls,
	Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
	Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
	They'll open of themselves. Hark you, far off
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Alarum afar off.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is Aufidius: list, what work he makes
	Amongst your cloven army.

</SENATOR_1>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! they are at it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>

	Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARTIUS>
<DIRECTION>
The Volsces enter, and pass over the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
	Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
	With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus:
	They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
	Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
	He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
	And he shall feel mine edge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Alarum. The Romans are beaten back to their trenches. Re-enter Marcius.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the contagion of the south light on you,
	You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
	Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
	Further than seen, and one infect another
	Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
	That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
	From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
	All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
	With flight and agu'd fear! Mend and charge home,
	Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
	And make my wars on you; look to 't: come on;
	If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
	As they us to our trenches follow'd
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Another alarum. The Volsces and Romans re-enter, and...
<... the fight is renewed. The Volsces retire into Corioli, and Marcius follows them to the gates.>
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
	'Tis for the followers Fortune widens them,
	Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

</MARCIUS>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the gates.

<SOLDIER_1>

<ALL>

	Slain, sir, doubtless.

</ALL>
<SOLDIER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Following the fliers at the very heels,
	With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
	Clapp'd-to their gates; he is himself alone,
	To answer all the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER_1>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O noble fellow!
	Who, sensibly, outdares his senseless sword,
	And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
	A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
	Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
	Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
	Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
	The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
	Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
	Were feverous and did tremble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARTIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Marcius, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, sir!

</SOLDIER_1>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Enter Marcius and Titus Lartius, with a trumpet.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See here these movers that do prize their hours
	At a crack'd drachme! Cushions, leaden spoons,
	Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
	Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
	Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
	And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
	There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
	Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
	Convenient numbers to make good the city,
	Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
	To help Cominius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
	Thy exercise hath been too violent
	For a second course of fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARTIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, praise me not;
	My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
	The blood I drop is rather physical
	Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
	I will appear, and fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
	Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
	Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
	Prosperity be thy page!

</LARTIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy friend no less

Exit Marcius.

Enter Cominius and Forces, retreating.
</DIRECTION>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breathe you, my friends: well fought; we are come off
	Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
	Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
	We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
	By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
	The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
	Lead their successes as we wish our own,
	That both our powers, with smiling fronts encountering,
	May give you thankful sacrifice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy news?
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The citizens of Corioli have issu'd,
	And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
	I saw our party to their trenches driven,
	And then I came away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though thou speak'st truth,

<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Above an hour, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<COMINIUS>

	'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:

</COMINIUS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spies of the Volsces
	Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel

	Half an hour since brought my report.

</MESSENGER>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's yonder,

<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As with a man busied about decrees:
	Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
	Ransoming him, or pitying, threat'ning the other;
	Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
	Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,

<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him alone;

	Marcius, we have at disadvantage fought,

	How lies their battle? Know you on which side

	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I guess, Marcius,
	Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
	Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
	Their very heart of hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do beseech you,
	By all the battles wherein we have fought,
	By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
	We have made to endure friends, that you directly
	Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
	And that you not delay the present, but,
	Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,
	We prove this very hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though I could wish
	You were conducted to a gentle bath,

	That best can aid your action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are they
	That most are willing. If any such be here--
	As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
	Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
	Lesser his person than an ill report;
	If any think brave death outweighs bad life,
	And that his country's dearer than himself;
	Let him, alone, or so many so minded,
	Wave thus, to express his disposition,
	And follow Marcius
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They all shout, and wave their swords; take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! me alone? Make you a sword of me?
	If these shows be not outward, which of you
	But is four Volsces? None of you but is
	Able to bear against the great Aufidius
	A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
	Though thanks to all, must I select from all: the rest
	Shall bear the business in some other fight,
	As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
	And four shall quickly draw out my command,
	Which men are best inclin'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<COMINIUS>

<MARCIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray now, no more: my mother,

</MARCIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall not be

	Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
	To hide your doings; and to silence that,
	Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
	Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,--
	In sign of what you are, not to reward
	What you have done,--before our army hear me.

<MARCIUS>

<MARCIUS>

	May these same instruments, which you profane,
	Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
	I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
	Made all of false-fac'd soothing!
	When steel grows soft as is the parasite's silk,
	Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
	No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
	My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch,
	Which, without note, here's many else have done,
	You shout me forth
	In acclamations hyperbolical;
	As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
	In praises sauc'd with lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too modest are you;

	To us that give you truly. By your patience,
	If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you,
	Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
	Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
	As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
	Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,
	My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
	With all his trim belonging; and from this time,

	What good condition can a treaty find
	I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
	I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me,
	And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
	As often as we eat. By the elements,
	If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
	He is mine, or I am his: mine emulation
	Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
	I thought to crush him in an equal force--
	True sword to sword--I'll potch at him some way

	Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
	Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
	My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
	At home, upon my brother's guard, even there

</MENENIUS>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, how are we censured?

</MENENIUS>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, sir; well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOTH>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience: give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures; at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for being proud?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do it not alone, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your abilities are too infant-like, for doing much alone. You talk of pride: O! that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves. O! that you could.

</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What then, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates--alias fools--as any in Rome.

<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Menenius, you are known well enough too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are,--I cannot call you Lycurguses,--if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything. You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of three-pence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing: all the peace you make in their cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. Good den to your worships: more of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you

	All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights

	Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
	Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
	Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges hors'd
	With variable complexions, all agreeing
	In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
	Do press among the popular throngs, and puff
	To win a vulgar station: our veil'd dames
	Commit the war of white and damask in

<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it must fall out
	To him or our authorities. For an end,
	We must suggest the people in what hatred
	He still hath held them; that to his power he would
	Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
	Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them,
	In human action and capacity,
	Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
	Than camels in the war; who have their provand
	Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
	For sinking under them.

<SICINIUS>

	This, as you say, suggested
	At some time when his soaring insolence
	Shall teach the people--which time shall not want,

	Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended,
	As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
	A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
	I never saw the like.

</OFFICER_2>
<OFFICER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_1>
<OFFICER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, there have been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore: so that if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_2>
<OFFICER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him; and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_1>
<OFFICER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report; but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions in their hearts, that for their tongues to be silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

	Masters of the people,
	Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter,--

	He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
	Than one on 's ears to hear it. Proceed, Cominius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
	Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
	That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
	Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
	The man I speak of cannot in the world
	Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,
	When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
	Beyond the mark of others; our then dictator,
	Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
	When with his Amazonian chin he drove
	The bristled lips before him. He bestrid
	An o'er-press'd Roman, and i' the consul's view
	Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
	And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
	When he might act the woman in the scene,
	He prov'd best man i' the field, and for his meed
	Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
	Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
	And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
	He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
	Before and in Corioli, let me say,
	I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers,
	And by his rare example made the coward
	Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
	A vessel under sail, so men obey'd,
	And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
	Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
	He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
	Was tim'd with dying cries: alone he enter'd
	The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
	With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
	And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
	Corioli like a planet. Now all's his:
	When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
	His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
	Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
	And to the battle came he; where he did
	Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
	'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd
	Both field and city ours, he never stood
	To ease his breast with panting.

<COMINIUS>

	Our spoils he kick'd at,
	And look'd upon things precious as they were

	His deeds with doing them, and is content
	To spend the time to end it.

	You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?

	We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to 't.

</CITIZEN_1>
<CORIOLANUS>

</CITIZEN_2>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, not mine own desire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How! not your own desire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to gain by you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The price is, to ask it kindly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kindly! sir, I pray, let me ha 't: I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what say you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shall ha 't, worthy sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A match, sir. There is in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms: adieu.

<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is something odd.

<CORIOLANUS>

	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.

</CITIZEN_3>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your enigma?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved the common people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_3>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod, and be off to them most counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man, and give it bountifully to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You have received many wounds for your country.

Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most sweet voices!
	Better it is to die, better to starve,
	Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
	Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
	To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
	Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to 't:
	What custom wills, in all things should we do 't,
	The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
	And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
	For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
	Let the high office and the honour go
	To one that would do thus. I am half through;
	The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
	Here come more voices
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter three other Citizens.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
	Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
	Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
	I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
	Done many things, some less, some more; your voices:
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
	Indeed, I would be consul.
<CITIZEN_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.

	Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people!

<MENENIUS>

Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius.

<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

</SICINIUS>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has our voices, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We pray the gods he may deserve your love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
	He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly,
	He flouted us downright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_3>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, 'tis his kind of speech; he did not mock us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
	He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
	His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, so he did, I am sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no; no man saw 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<CITIZEN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he had wounds, which he could show in private;
	And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
	'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
	But by your voices, will not so permit me;
	Your voices therefore:' when we granted that,
	Here was, 'I thank you for your voices, thank you,
	Your most sweet voices: now you have left your voices
	I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_3>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, either were you ignorant to see 't,
	Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
	To yield your voices?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you not have told him
	As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
	But was a petty servant to the state,
	He was your enemy, ever spake against
	Your liberties and the charters that you bear
	I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
	A place of potency and sway o' the state,
	If he should still malignantly remain
	Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
	Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
	That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
	Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
	Would think upon you for your voices and
	Translate his malice towards you into love,
	Standing your friendly lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus to have said,
	As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
	And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
	Either his gracious promise, which you might,
	As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
	Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
	Which easily endures not article
	Tying him to aught; so, putting him to rage,
	You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler,
	And pass'd him unelected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you perceive
	He did solicit you in free contempt
	When he did need your loves, and do you think
	That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
	When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
	No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
	Against the rectorship of judgment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you
	Ere now denied the asker? and now again
	Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
	Your su'd-for tongues?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<CITIZEN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_3>
<CITIZEN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And will deny him:
	I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_2>
<CITIZEN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CITIZEN_1>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
	They have chose a consul that will from them take
	Their liberties; make them of no more voice
	Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
	As therefore kept to do so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let them assemble;
	And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
	Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride,
	And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
	With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
	How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
	Thinking upon his services, took from you
	The apprehension of his present portance,
	Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
	After the inveterate hate he bears you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay
	A fault on us, your tribunes; that we labour'd,--
	No impediment between,--but that you must
	Cast your election on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, you chose him
	More after our commandment than as guided
	By your own true affections; and that, your minds,
	Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
	Than what you should, made you against the grain
	To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
	How youngly he began to serve his country,
	How long continu'd, and what stock he springs of,
	The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
	That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
	Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
	Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
	That our best water brought by conduits hither;
	And Censorinus, that was so surnam'd,--
	And nobly nam'd so, twice being censor,--
	Was his great ancestor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thus descended,
	That hath, beside, well in his person wrought
	To be set high in place, we did commend
	To your remembrances: but you have found,
	Scaling his present bearing with his past,
	That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
	Your sudden approbation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say you ne'er had done 't--
	Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
	And presently, when you have drawn your number,
	Repair to the Capitol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<ALL>

	We will so; almost all
	Repent in their election.

Exeunt Citizens.

<BRUTUS>

	With their refusal, both observe and answer
	The vantage of his anger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the Capitol, come:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw you Aufidius?

</CORIOLANUS>
<LARTIUS>

	On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse

<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How? what?

</CORIOLANUS>
<LARTIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How often he had met you, sword to sword;

</CORIOLANUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call't not a plot:
	The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
	When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
	Scandall'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
	Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

	Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
	Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
	Your fellow tribune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You show too much of that
	For which the people stir; if you will pass
	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
	Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit;
	Or never be so noble as a consul,
	Nor yoke with him for tribune.

<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's be calm.

</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>

	I' the plain way of his merit.

</SENATOR_1>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
	I crave their pardons:
	For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
	Regard me as I do not flatter, and
	Therein behold themselves: I say again,
	In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our senate
	The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
	Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd and scatter'd,
	By mingling them with us, the honour'd number;
	Who lack'd not virtue, no, nor power, but that
	Which they have given to beggars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<SENATOR_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more words, we beseech you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_1>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How! no more!
	As for my country I have shed my blood,
	Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
	Coin words till they decay against those measles,

	Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
	By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a mind
	That shall remain a poison where it is,
	Not poison any further.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall remain!
	Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
	His absolute 'shall?'

<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Twas from the canon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Shall!'
	O good but most unwise patricians! why,
	You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
	Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
	That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
	The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
	To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
	And make your channel his? If he have power,
	Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
	Your dangerous lenity. If you are learned,
	Be not as common fools; if you are not,
	Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians
	If they be senators; and they are no less,
	When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
	Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
	And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
	His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
	Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself!
	It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
	To know, when two authorities are up;
	Neither supreme, how soon confusion
	May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
	The one by the other.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, on to the market-place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
	The corn o' the store-house gratis, as 'twas us'd
	Sometime in Greece,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well; no more of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though there the people had more absolute power,
	I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
	The ruin of the state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, shall the people give
	One that speaks thus their voice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give my reasons,
	More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
	Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
	They ne'er did service for 't. Being press'd to the war,
	Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
	They would not thread the gates: this kind of service
	Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war,
	Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
	Most valour, spoke not for them. The accusation
	Which they have often made against the senate,
	All cause unborn, could never be the motive
	Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
	How shall this bisson multitude digest
	The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
	What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
	We are the greater poll, and in true fear
	They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
	The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
	Call our cares, fears; which will in time break ope
	The locks o' the senate, and bring in the crows
	To peck the eagles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough, with over-measure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, take more:
	What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
	Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
	Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
	Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
	Cannot conclude, but by the yea and no
	Of general ignorance,--it must omit
	Real necessities, and give way the while
	To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows
	Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
	You that will be less fearful than discreet,
	That love the fundamental part of state
	More than you doubt the change on 't, that prefer
	A noble life before a long, and wish
	To jump a body with a dangerous physic
	That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
	The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
	The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
	Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
	Of that integrity which should become it,
	Not having the power to do the good it would,
	For the ill which doth control 't.

	You are too absolute;

<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why force you this?

<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that now it lies you on to speak
	To the people; not by your own instruction,
	Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
	But with such words that are but rooted in
	Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
	Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
	Now, this no more dishonours you at all
	Than to take in a town with gentle words,
	Which else would put you to your fortune and
	The hazard of much blood.
	I would dissemble with my nature where
	My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
	I should do so in honour: I am in this,
	Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
	And you will rather show our general louts
	How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
	For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
	Of what that want might ruin.

	I prithee now, my son,
	Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
	And thus far having stretch'd it,--here be with them,
	Thy knee bussing the stones,--for in such business
	Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
	More learned than the ears,--waving thy head,
	Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
	Now humble as the ripest mulberry
	That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
	Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
	Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
	Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
	In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
	As thou hast power and person.

<MENENIUS>

</VOLUMNIA>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
	Must I with my base tongue give to my noble heart
	A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
	Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
	This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,
	And throw 't against the wind. To the market-place!
	You have put me now to such a part which never
	I shall discharge to the life.

	Thou hast not done before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I must do 't:
	Away, my disposition, and possess me
	Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd,
	Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
	Small as a eunuch, or the virgin voice
	That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves
	Tent in my cheeks, and school-boys' tears take up
	The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue
	Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
	Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
	That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do 't,
	Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,
	And by my body's action teach my mind
	A most inherent baseness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<VOLUMNIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At thy choice then:
	To beg of thee it is my more dishonour
	Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
	Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
	Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
	With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list,
	Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
	But owe thy pride thyself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLUMNIA>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray, be content:
	Mother, I am going to the market-place;
	Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
	Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd
	Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
	Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,
	Or never trust to what my tongue can do
	I' the way of flattery further.

	For that he has,--

	Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
	Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
	That do distribute it; in the name o' the people,
	And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
	Even from this instant, banish him our city,

	What, what, what!
	I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,
	Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
	If you had been the wife of Hercules,
	Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd
	Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
	Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife! my mother!
	I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
	Thy tears are salter than a younger man's.
	And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
	I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
	Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
	'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
	As 'tis to laugh at them. My mother, you wot well
	My hazards still have been your solace; and
	Believe 't not lightly,--though I go alone
	Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
	Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen,--your son
	Will or exceed the common or be caught
	With cautelous baits and practice.

<VOLUMNIA>

	My first son,

	That starts i' the way before thee.

	I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
	Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us,
	And we of thee: so, if the time thrust forth
	A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
	O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
	And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
	I' the absence of the needer.

</COMINIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fare ye well:
	Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
	Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
	That's yet unbruis'd: bring me but out at gate.
	Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
	My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
	Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
	While I remain above the ground you shall
	Hear from me still; and never of me aught
	But what is like me formerly.

<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's worthily

Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting.

<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you well, sir, and you know me: your name I think is Adrian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so, sir: truly, I have forget you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicanor? No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had more beard, when I last saw you; but your favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state to find you out there: you have well saved me a day's journey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath been! Is it ended then? Our state thinks not-so; they are in a most war-like preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again. For the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coriolanus banished!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Banished, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request of his country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall, between this and supper, tell you most strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A most royal one: the centurions and their charges distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment, and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLSCE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<VOLSCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause to be glad of yours.

<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A goodly city is this Antium. City,
	'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
	Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
	Have I heard groan and drop: then, know me not,
	Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
	In puny battle slay me.

<DIRECTION>
Enter a Citizen.

	And you.

	Direct me, if it be your will,
	Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?

</CORIOLANUS>
<CITIZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
	At his house this night.

Exit Citizen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	O world! thy slippery turns. Friends now fast sworn,
	Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
	Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
	Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
	Unseparable, shall within this hour,
	On a dissension of a doit, break out
	To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
	Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
	To take the one the other, by some chance,
	Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
	And interjoin their issues. So with me:
	My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
	This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
	He does fair justice; if he give me way,
	I'll do his country service.

</CORIOLANUS>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, what's thy name?
	Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face

	<DIALOGUE>

</AUFIDIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
	To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
	Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
	My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
	The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
	Shed for my thankless country, are requited
	But with that surname; a good memory,
	And witness of the malice and displeasure
	Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
	The cruelty and envy of the people,
	Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
	Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
	And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
	Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
	Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
	Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
	I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
	I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
	To be full quit of those my banishers,
	Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
	A heart of wreak in thee, that will revenge
	Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
	Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight,
	And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it,
	That my revengeful services may prove
	As benefits to thee, for I will fight
	Against my canker'd country with the spleen
	Of all the under fiends. But if so be
	Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
	Thou art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
	Longer to live most weary, and present
	My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
	Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
	Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
	Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
	And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
	It be to do thee service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Marcius, Marcius!
	Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
	A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
	Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
	And say, ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
	Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
	Mine arms about that body, where against
	My grained ash a hundred times hath broke,
	And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
	The anvil of my sword, and do contest
	As hotly and as nobly with thy love
	As ever in ambitious strength I did
	Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
	I lov'd the maid I married; never man
	Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
	Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
	Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
	Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
	We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
	Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
	Or lose mine arm for 't. Thou hast beat me out
	Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
	Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
	We have been down together in my sleep,
	Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
	And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
	Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
	Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
	From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
	Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
	Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O! come; go in,
	And take our friendly senators by the hands,
	Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
	Who am prepar'd against your territories,
	Though not for Rome itself.

	Thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways;
	Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,

	To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
	Let me commend thee first to those that shall
	Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
	And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
	Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What an arm he has! He turned me about with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I cannot tell how to term it.

</SERVANT_3>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say 'thwack our general?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not say, 'thwack our general;' but he was always good enough for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_3>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was too hard for him,--directly to say the truth on 't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado.

</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_2>

	An he had been cannibally given, he might have broiled and eaten him too.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But, more of thy news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no question asked him by any of the senators, but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him; sanctifies himself with 's hand, and turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is out i' the middle, and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, and sowle the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he will mow down all before him, and leave his passage polled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_3>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he's as like to do 't as any man I can imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<SERVANT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do 't! he will do 't for--look you, sir--he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir--as it were--durst not--look you, sir--show themselves--as we term it--his friends, whilst he's in directitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_3>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Directitude! what's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like comes after rain, and revel all with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when goes this forward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow; to-day; presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis, as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.

</SERVANT_3>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.

</SERVANT_2>

	Destroy what lies before them.

<MENENIUS>

	'Tis Aufidius,
	Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
	Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
	Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
	And durst not once peep out.

</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cannot be!
	We have record that very well it can,
	And three examples of the like have been
	Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
	Before you punish him, where he heard this,
	Lest you shall chance to whip your information,

	Of what is to be dreaded.

	Yes, worthy sir,

</MESSENGER>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What more fearful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
	How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
	Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
	And vows revenge as spacious as between
	The young'st and oldest thing.

<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is most likely.

	If!
	He is their god: he leads them like a thing

	Or butchers killing flies.

<MENENIUS>

	But is this true, sir?

</BRUTUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay; and you'll look pale
	Before you find it other. All the regions

	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who shall ask it?
	The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
	Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
	Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
	Should say, 'Be good to Rome,' they charg'd him even
	As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,
	And therein show'd like enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis true:
	If he were putting to my house the brand

	Who did hoot him out o' the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I fear
	They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,

	And is Aufidius with him? You are they
	That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
	Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
	Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
	And not a hair upon a soldier's head
	Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
	As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
	And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
	If he could burn us all into one coal,
	We have deserv'd it.

<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do they still fly to the Roman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUFIDIUS>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
	Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
	Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
	And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
	Even by your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot help it now,
	Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
	Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
	Even to my person, than I thought he would
	When first I did embrace him; yet his nature
	In that's no changeling, and I must excuse
	What cannot be amended.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUFIDIUS>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet, I wish, sir,--
	I mean for your particular,--you had not
	Join'd in commission with him; but either
	Had borne the action of yourself, or else
	To him had left it solely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
	When he shall come to his account, he knows not
	What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
	And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
	To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,
	And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
	Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
	As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
	That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
	Whene'er we come to our account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUFIDIUS>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<AUFIDIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All places yield to him ere he sits down;
	And the nobility of Rome are his:
	The senators and patricians love him too:
	The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
	Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
	To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
	As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
	By sovereignty of nature. First he was
	A noble servant to them, but he could not
	Carry his honours even; whether 'twas pride,
	Which out of daily fortune ever taints
	The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
	To fail in the disposing of those chances
	Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
	Not to be other than one thing, not moving
	From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
	Even with the same austerity and garb
	As he controll'd the war; but one of these,
	As he hath spices of them all, not all,
	For I dare so far free him, made him fear'd,
	So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit
	To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
	Lie in the interpretation of the time;
	And power, unto itself most commendable,
	Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
	To extol what it hath done.
	One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
	Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
	Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
	Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine

<DIRECTION>
Rome. A Public Place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Menenius, Cominius, Sicinius, Brutus, and Others.
</DIRECTION>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
	Which was sometime his general; who lov'd him
	In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
	But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
	A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
	The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd
	To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He would not seem to know me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet one time he did call me by my name.
	I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
	That we have bled together. Coriolanus
	He would not answer to; forbad all names;
	He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
	Till he had forg'd himself a name o' the fire
	Of burning Rome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, so: you have made good work!
	A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
	To make coals cheap: a noble memory!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
	When it was less expected: he replied,
	It was a bare petition of a state
	To one whom they had punish'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well.
	Could he say less?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I offer'd to awaken his regard
	For's private friends: his answer to me was,
	He could not stay to pick them in a pile
	Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
	For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
	And still to nose the offence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For one poor grain or two!
	I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
	And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
	You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
	Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
	In this so-never-needed help, yet do not
	Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
	Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
	More than the instant army we can make,
	Might stop our countryman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; I'll not meddle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, go to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only make trial what your love can do
	For Rome, towards Marcius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well; and say that Marcius
	Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
	Unheard; what then?
	But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
	With his unkindness? say 't be so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet your good will
	Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
	As you intended well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll undertake it:
	I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip,
	And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
	He was not taken well; he had not din'd:
	The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
	We pout upon the morning, are unapt
	To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
	These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
	With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
	Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore, I'll watch him
	Till he be dieted to my request,
	And then I'll set upon him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<BRUTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the very road into his kindness,
	And cannot lose your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUTUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good faith, I'll prove him,
	Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
	Of my success.

<DIRECTION>
Exit.

<COMINIUS>

	He'll never hear him.

<SICINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SICINIUS>
<COMINIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
	Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury
	The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
	'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
	Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do
	He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
	Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
	So that all hope is vain
	Unless his noble mother and his wife,
	Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
	For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,
	And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From whence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Rome.

</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_1>

	You may not pass; you must return: our general

	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before
	You'll speak with Coriolanus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good my friends,
	If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
	And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
	My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
	Is not here passable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell thee, fellow,
	Thy general is my lover: I have been
	The book of his good acts, whence men have read
	His fame unparallel'd, haply amplified;
	For I have ever glorified my friends--
	Of whom he's chief--with all the size that verity
	Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
	Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
	I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
	Have almost stamp'd the leasing. Therefore, fellow,
	I must have leave to pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. Therefore go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howsoever you have been his liar--as you say you have--I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not speak with him till after dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a Roman, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am as thy general is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and, in a violent popular ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived; therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah, if thy captain know I were here, he would use me with estimation.

	Come, my captain knows you not.

<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORIOLANUS>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you: you shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment with him, if thou standest not i' the state of hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now presently, and swound for what's to come upon thee
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Coriolanus.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this, who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENENIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away!

	How! away!

</MENENIUS>
<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
	Are servanted to others: though I owe
	My revenge properly, my remission lies
	In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
	Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
	Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone:
	Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
	Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,
	Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gives a paper.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,

	What cause, do you think, I have to swound?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<MENENIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I neither care for the world, nor your general: for such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another. Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was said to, Away!

<CORIOLANUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This last old man,
	Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
	Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
	Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
	Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
	Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
	The first conditions, which they did refuse,
	And cannot now accept, to grace him only
	That thought he could do more. A very little

	Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
	What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,
	Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
	Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
	As if Olympus to a molehill should
	In supplication nod; and my young boy
	Hath an aspect of intercession, which
	Great nature cries, 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
	Plough Rome, and harrow Italy; I'll never
	Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand

	Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment

	That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
	Alas! how can we for our country pray,
	Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
	Whereto we are bound? Alack! or we must lose
	The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
	Our comfort in the country. We must find
	An evident calamity, though we had
	Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
	Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
	With manacles through our streets, or else
	Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
	And bear the palm for having bravely shed
	Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
	I purpose not to wait on Fortune till
	These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
	Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
	Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
	March to assault thy country than to tread--
	Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
	That brought thee to this world.

	Nay, go not from us thus.
	If it were so, that our request did tend
	To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
	The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
	As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
	Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
	May say, 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
	'This we receiv'd;' and each in either side
	Give the all-hail to thee, and cry, 'Be bless'd
	For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
	The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
	That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
	Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
	Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
	Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
	But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
	Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
	To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son!
	Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
	To imitate the graces of the gods;
	To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
	And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
	That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
	Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
	Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
	He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
	Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
	Than can our reasons. There is no man in the world
	More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
	Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
	Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy;
	When she--poor hen! fond of no second brood--
	Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home,
	Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
	And spurn me back; but if it be not so,
	Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
	That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
	To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
	Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
	To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
	Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
	This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
	And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold us.
	This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
	But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
	Does reason our petition with more strength
	Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
	This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
	His wife is in Corioli, and his child
	Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
	I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
	And then I'll speak a little.

	Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
	Which to this hour bewail the injury,
	Yet he shall have a noble memory.
	Assist.
