Enter Hostess and Sly.

	I'll pheeze you, in faith.

<HOSTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pair of stocks, you rogue!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOSTESS>
<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!

<HOSTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?

<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law. I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly

</SLY>

Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsman and Servants.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
	Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd,
	And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
	Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
	At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
	I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<HUNTSMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord;
	He cried upon it at the merest loss,
	And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
	Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTSMAN_1>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
	I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
	But sup them well, and look unto them all:
	To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<HUNTSMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTSMAN_1>
<LORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sees Sly.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<HUNTSMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
	This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTSMAN_2>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
	Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
	Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
	What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
	Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
	A most delicious banquet by his bed,
	And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
	Would not the beggar then forget himself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<HUNTSMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTSMAN_1>
<HUNTSMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTSMAN_2>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
	Then take him up and manage well the jest.
	Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
	And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
	Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
	And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.
	Procure me music ready when he wakes,
	To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
	And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
	And with a low submissive reverence
	Say, 'What is it your honour will command?'
	Let one attend him with a silver basin
	Full of rose-water, and bestrew'd with flowers;
	Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
	And say, 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
	Some one be ready with a costly suit,
	And ask him what apparel he will wear;
	Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
	And that his lady mourns at his disease.
	Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
	And, when he says he is--say that he dreams,
	For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
	This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
	It will be pastime passing excellent,
	If it be husbanded with modesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<HUNTSMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
	As he shall think, by our true diligence,
	He is no less than what we say he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTSMAN_1>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take him up gently, and to bed with him,
	And each one to his office when he wakes

Sly is borne out. A trumpet sounds.

<PLAYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thank your honour.

</PLAYERS>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<PLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So please your lordship to accept our duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAYER>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
	Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
	'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.
	I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
	Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<PLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAYER>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
	Well, you are come to me in happy time,
	The rather for I have some sport in hand
	Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
	There is a lord will hear you play to-night;
	But I am doubtful of your modesties,
	Lest, over-eyeing of his odd behaviour,--
	For yet his honour never heard a play,--
	You break into some merry passion
	And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
	If you should smile he grows impatient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<PLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves
	Were he the veriest antick in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAYER>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
	And give them friendly welcome every one:
	Let them want nothing that my house affords
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt one with the Players.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
	And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
	That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
	And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
	Tell him from me,--as he will win my love,--
	He bear himself with honourable action,
	Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
	Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
	Such duty to the drunkard let him do
	With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy;
	And say, 'What is't your honour will command,
	Wherein your lady and your humble wife
	May show her duty, and make known her love?'
	And then, with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
	And with declining head into his bosom,
	Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
	To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
	Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
	No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
	And if the boy have not a woman's gift
	To rain a shower of commanded tears,
	An onion will do well for such a shift,
	Which in a napkin being close convey'd,
	Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
	See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
	Anon I'll give thee more instructions
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Servant.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
	Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman:
	I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
	And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
	When they do homage to this simple peasant.
	I'll in to counsel them: haply, my presence
	May well abate the over merry spleen
	Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

Exeunt.

	What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_3>
<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour, nor lordship: I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.

</SLY>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
	O, that a mighty man, of such descent,
	Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
	Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly's son, of Burtonheath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught: here's--

	O! this it is that makes your lady mourn.

	O! this it is that makes your servants droop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
	As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
	O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
	Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
	And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
	Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
	Each in his office ready at thy beck:
	Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Music.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
	Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
	Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
	On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
	Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground:
	Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
	Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
	Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
	Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?
	Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them,
	And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
	As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

</SERVANT_1>
<SERVANT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
	Adonis painted by a running brook,
	And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
	Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
	Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<LORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
	And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
	As lively painted as the deed was done.

</LORD>
<SERVANT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
	Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds;

	So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

<LORD>

	Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord:
	Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
	Than any woman in this waning age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
	Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
	She was the fairest creature in the world;
	And yet she is inferior to none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
	Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
	I do not sleep; I see, I hear, I speak;
	I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:
	Upon my life, I am a lord indeed;
	And not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.
	Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
	And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

	O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
	O, that once more you knew but what you are!

	Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_2>
<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
	But did I never speak of all that time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLY>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! yes, my lord, but very idle words;
	For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
	Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,
	And rail upon the hostess of the house,
	And say you would present her at the leet,
	Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
	Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANT_1>
<SLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLY>
<SERVANT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, you know no house, nor no such maid,
	Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,

	And Peter Turf, and Henry Pimpernell,
	And twenty more such names and men as these,
	Which never were nor no man ever saw.

	Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

Padua. A public Place.

Enter Lucentio and Tranio.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tranio, since for the great desire I had
	To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
	I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
	The pleasant garden of great Italy;
	And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
	With his good will and thy good company,
	My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
	Here let us breathe, and haply institute
	A course of learning and ingenious studies.
	Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
	Gave me my being and my father first,
	A merchant of great traffic through the world,
	Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.
	Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
	It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
	To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
	And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
	Virtue and that part of philosophy
	Will I apply that treats of happiness
	By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
	Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
	And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
	A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
	And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mi perdonate, gentle master mine,
	I am in all affected as yourself,
	Glad that you thus continue your resolve
	To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
	Only, good master, while we do admire
	This virtue and this moral discipline,
	Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
	Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
	As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
	Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
	And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
	Music and poesy use to quicken you;
	The mathematics and the metaphysics,
	Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
	No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
	In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
	If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
	We could at once put us in readiness,
	And take a lodging fit to entertain
	Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
	But stay awhile: what company is this?

<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, importune me no further,
	For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
	That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
	Before I have a husband for the elder.
	If either of you both love Katharina,
	Because I know you well and love you well,
	Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

	Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
	Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

</HORTENSIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
	I wis it is not half way to her heart;
	But if it were, doubt not her care should be
	To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
	And paint your face, and use you like a fool.

	Gentlemen, that I may soon make good

	Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
	Sorry am I that our good will effects
	Bianca's grief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why will you mew her up,

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
	Go in, Bianca

	<DIALOGUE>
	And for I know she taketh most delight
	In music, instruments, and poetry,
	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
	I will be very kind, and liberal
	To mine own children in good bringing up;
	And so, farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
	For I have more to commune with Bianca.

	You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out: our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,--that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love,--to labour and effect one thing specially.

</HORTENSIO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tush, Gremio! though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<GREMIO>

	I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition, to be whipped at the high-cross every morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained, till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am agreed: and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her. Come on.

<TRANIO>

	I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
	That love should of a sudden take such hold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Tranio! till I found it to be true,
	I never thought it possible or likely;
	But see, while idly I stood looking on,
	I found the effect of love in idleness;
	And now in plainness do confess to thee,
	That art to me as secret and as dear
	As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,
	Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
	If I achieve not this young modest girl.
	Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:
	Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, it is no time to chide you now;
	Affection is not rated from the heart:
	If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
	Redime te captum, quam queas minimo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gramercies, lad; go forward: this contents:
	The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
	Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
	When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
	And with her breath she did perfume the air;
	Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
	Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd,
	That till the father rid his hands of her,
	Master, your love must live a maid at home;
	And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
	Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
	But art thou not advis'd he took some care
	To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have it, Tranio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, for my hand,
	Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me thine first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be schoolmaster,
	And undertake the teaching of the maid:
	That's your device.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is: may it be done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
	And be in Padua here Vincentio's son?
	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;
	Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basta; content thee; for I have it full.
	We have not yet been seen in any house,
	Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
	For man, or master: then, it follows thus:
	Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
	Keep house, and port, and servants, as I should:
	I will some other be; some Florentine,
	Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
	'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
	Uncase thee, take my colour'd hat and cloak:
	When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
	But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<DIRECTION>
They exchange habits.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So had you need.
	In brief then, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
	And I am tied to be obedient;
	For so your father charg'd me at our parting,
	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
	Although I think 'twas in another sense:
	I am content to be Lucentio,
	Because so well I love Lucentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;
	And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
	Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
	Here comes the rogue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Biondello.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah, where have you been?
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
	Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes,
	Or you stol'n his? or both? pray, what's the news?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
	And therefore frame your manners to the time.
	Your fellow Tranio, here, to save my life,
	Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
	And I for my escape have put on his;
	For in a quarrel since I came ashore
	I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.
	Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
	While I make way from hence to save my life:
	You understand me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, sir! ne'er a whit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
	Tranio is changed to Lucentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The better for him: would I were so too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So would I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
	That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
	But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
	You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
	But in all places else your master, Lucentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>

	Verona, for awhile I take my leave,
	To see my friends in Padua; but, of all
	My best beloved and approved friend,
	Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
	Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

	Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there any man has rebused your worship?

<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Villain, I say, knock me at this gate;
	And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GRUMIO>

	My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
	And then I know after who comes by the worst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will it not be?
	Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;

<HORTENSIO>

	How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
	Con tutto il cuore ben trovato, may I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signior mio Petruchio.
	Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?
	Whom would to God, I had well knock'd at first,
	Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
	I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
	And could not get him for my heart to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly?' And come you now with 'knocking at the gate?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge.
	Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
	Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
	And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
	Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such wind as scatters young men through the world
	To seek their fortunes further than at home,
	Where small experience grows. But in a few,
	Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
	Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
	And I have thrust myself into this maze,
	Haply to wive and thrive as best I may.
	Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
	And so am come abroad to see the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,
	And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
	Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel;
	And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
	And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
	And I'll not wish thee to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we,
	Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
	One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
	As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
	Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
	As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
	As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
	She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
	Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
	As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
	I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
	If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
	I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
	I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
	With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,
	Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
	Her only fault,--and that is faults enough,--
	Is, that she is intolerable curst
	And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,
	That, were my state far worser than it is,
	I would not wed her for a mine of gold:
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
	Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
	For I will board her, though she chide as loud
	As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father is Baptista Minola,
	An affable and courteous gentleman;
	Her name is Katharina Minola,
	Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know her father, though I know not her;
	And he knew my deceased father well.
	I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
	And therefore let me be thus bold with you,
	To give you over at this first encounter,
	Unless you will accompany me thither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may, perhaps, call him half a score knaves or so: why, that's nothing: an he begin once, he'll rail in his ropetricks. I'll tell you what, sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
	For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
	He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
	His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
	And her withholds from me and other more,
	Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
	Supposing it a thing impossible,
	For those defects I have before rehears'd,
	That ever Katharina will be woo'd:
	Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
	That none shall have access unto Bianca,
	Till Katharine the curst have got a husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katharine the curst!
	A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
	And offer me, disguis'd in sober robes,
	To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
	Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
	That so I may, by this device, at least
	Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
	And unsuspected court her by herself.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Peace, Grumio! 'tis the rival of my love.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A proper stripling, and an amorous!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! very well; I have perus'd the note.
	Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound:
	All books of love, see that at any hand,
	And see you read no other lectures to her.
	You understand me. Over and beside
	Signior Baptista's liberality,
	I'll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,
	And let me have them very well perfum'd;
	For she is sweeter than perfume itself
	To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you,

	Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
	Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

	Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
	I promis'd to inquire carefully
	About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
	And, by good fortune, I have lighted well
	On this young man; for learning and behaviour
	Fit for her turn; well read in poetry
	And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

	Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
	And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
	Have I not in a pitched battle heard
	Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
	And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
	That gives not half so great a blow to hear
	As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?

	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,

	Baptista is a noble gentleman,
	To whom my father is not all unknown;

	She may more suitors have, and me for one.
	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
	Then well one more may fair Bianca have,
	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,

	Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:

	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

	In the preferment of the eldest sister.
	This liberty is all that I request,

	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
	And free access and favour as the rest:

<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
	And every day I cannot come to woo.
	You knew my father well, and in him me,
	Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
	Which I have better'd rather than decreas'd:
	Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
	What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

	After my death the one half of my lands,

	And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
	Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,

	Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
	That covenants may be kept on either hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
	That is, her love; for that is all in all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
	I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
	And where two raging fires meet together
	They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
	Though little fire grows great with little wind,
	Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;
	So I to her, and so she yields to me;
	For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
	But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
	I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
	And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
	When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
	'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume with them;'
	And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
	And through the instrument my pate made way;
	And there I stood amazed for a while,
	As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
	While she did call me rascal fiddler,
	And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms
	As she had studied to misuse me so.

	Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
	She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
	Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
	As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
	Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
	Then I'll commend her volubility,
	And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
	If she do bid me pack; I'll give her thanks,
	As though she bid me stay by her a week:
	If she deny to wed; I'll crave the day
	When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
	But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.

	You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,

	But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom;
	Kate of Kate-Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
	For dainties are all cates: and therefore, Kate,
	Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
	Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
	Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,--
	Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,--
	Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.

	I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
	'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
	And now I find report a very liar;
	For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
	But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
	Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
	Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will;
	Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
	But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
	With gentle conference, soft and affable.
	Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
	O slanderous world! Kate, like the hazel-twig,
	Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
	As hazel nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
	O! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

	Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharine, in thy bed:
	And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
	Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
	That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
	And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
	Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
	For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,--
	Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,--
	Thou must be married to no man but me:
	For I am he am born to tame you, Kate;
	And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate

	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
	That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
	If she be curst, it is for policy,
	For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
	She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
	For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
	And Roman Lucrece for her chastity;
	And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
	That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

	Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
	If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
	'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
	That she shall still be curst in company.
	I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
	How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate.
	She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
	She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
	That in a twink she won me to her love.
	O! you are novices: 'tis a world to see,
	How tame, when men and women are alone,
	A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
	Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice
	To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
	Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
	I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine.

	Content you, gentlemen; I'll compound this strife:

	Shall have my Bianca's love.
	Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, as you know, my house within the city
	Is richly furnished with plate and gold:
	Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
	My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
	In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
	In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
	Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
	Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
	Valance of Venice gold in needle-work,
	Pewter and brass, and all things that belong
	To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
	I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
	Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
	And all things answerable to this portion.
	Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
	And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
	If whilst I live she will be only mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
	I am my father's heir and only son:
	If I may have your daughter to my wife,
	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
	Besides two thousand ducats by the year
	Of fruitful land, all of which shall be her jointure.
	What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
	My land amounts not to so much in all:
	That she shall have; besides an argosy
	That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
	What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
	Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
	And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,
	And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
	And she can have no more than all I have:
	If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
	By your firm promise. Gremio is out-vied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must confess your offer is the best;
	And, let your father make her the assurance,
	She is your own; else, you must pardon me:
	If you should die before him, where's her dower?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

	And may not young men die as well as old?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, gentlemen,
	I am thus resolv'd. On Sunday next, you know,
	My daughter Katharine is to be married:
	Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
	Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
	If not, to Signior Gremio:
	And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

<LUCENTIO>

	Preposterous ass, that never read so far

	'Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,

	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
	That Katharine and Petruchio should be married,
	And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
	What will be said? what mockery will it be
	To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
	To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
	What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forc'd
	To give my hand oppos'd against my heart
	Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen;
	Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
	I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
	Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
	And to be noted for a merry man,
	He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
	Make friends invite, and proclaim the banns;
	Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
	Now must the world point at poor Katharine,
	And say, 'Lo! there is mad Petruchio's wife,
	If it would please him come and marry her.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.
	Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
	Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
	Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
	Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BIONDELLO>

	Master, master! news! old news, and such news as you never heard of!

</BIONDELLO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it new and old too? how may that be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?

<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, say, what to thine old news?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points: his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back, and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather, which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who comes with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, sir! his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the 'humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
	Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am glad he is come, howsoe'er he comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, he comes not.

</BIONDELLO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didst thou not say he comes?

</BAPTISTA>
<BIONDELLO>

	Who? that Petruchio came?

</BIONDELLO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, that Petruchio came.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir; I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that's all one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, by Saint Jamy,

	Were it better, I should rush in thus.
	But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
	How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
	And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
	As if they saw some wondrous monument,
	Some comet, or unusual prodigy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, you know this is your weddingday:
	First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
	Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
	Fie! doff this habit, shame to your estate,
	An eye-sore to our solemn festival.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And tell us what occasion of import
	Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
	And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
	Sufficeth, I am come to keep my word,
	Though in some part enforced to digress;
	Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
	As you shall well be satisfied withal.
	But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
	The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
	Go to my chamber; put on clothes of mine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
	To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
	Could I repair what she will wear in me
	As I can change these poor accoutrements,
	'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
	But what a fool am I to chat with you
	When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
	And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

	It skills not much, we'll fit him to our turn,--
	And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,

</TRANIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tut! she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.
	I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
	Should ask, if Katharine should be his wife,
	'Ay, by gogs-wouns!' quoth he; and swore so loud,
	That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
	And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
	The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
	That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
	'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What said the wench when he arose again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trembled and shook; for why he stampt and swore,
	As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
	But after many ceremonies done,
	He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he; as if
	He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
	After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
	And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
	Having no other reason
	But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,
	And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
	This done, he took the bride about the neck,
	And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
	That at the parting all the church did echo:
	And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
	And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
	Such a mad marriage never was before.
	Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play

	Fie, fie, on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever man so rayed? was ever man so weary?

Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me; but I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's ha't, good Grumio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lend thine ear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

<GRUMIO>
<DIRECTION>
Striking him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And therefore it is called a sensible tale; and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both of one horse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that to thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, a horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled: how he left her with the horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse stumbled; how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she prayed, that never prayed before; how I cried; how the horses ran away; how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay; and that, thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest: let their heads be sleekly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horsetail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call them forth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear? ho! you must meet my master to countenance my mistress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, she hath a face of her own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who knows not that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou, it seems, that callest for company to countenance her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I call them forth to credit her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

<NATHANIEL>

	All things is ready. How near is our master?

</NATHANIEL>
<GRUMIO>

</GRUMIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Petruchio and Katharina.
</DIRECTION>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where be these knaves? What! no man at door
	To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?
	Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?--

</PETRUCHIO>
<SERVANTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, here, sir; here, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERVANTS>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
	You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
	What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
	Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.

</GRUMIO>
<PETRUCHIO>

	You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
	Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
	And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
	And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel,
	There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
	And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing,
	There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
	The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
	Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in

<DIRECTION>
Exeunt some of the Servants.

<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Servants with supper.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, when, I say?--Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.--
	Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains! When?
	It was the friar of orders grey,

	Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Strikes him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
	Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
	Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence
	And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Servant.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
	Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
	Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.--

</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Servant lets the ewer fall. Petruchio strikes him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
	Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
	Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?--
	What's this? mutton?

</PETRUCHIO>
<SERVANT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay.

	I.

</SERVANT_1>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
	What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
	How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
	And serve it thus to me that love it not
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Throws the meat, &c. at them.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all.
	You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
	What! do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
	The meat was well if you were so contented.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
	And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
	For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
	And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
	Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
	Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
	Be patient; to-morrow't shall be mended,
	And for this night we'll fast for company:
	Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Petruchio, Katharina, and Curtis.

<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Curtis.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<CURTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
	And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
	Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
	And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
	Away, away! for he is coming hither
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
</CURTIS>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Petruchio.
</DIRECTION>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
	And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
	My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,
	And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
	For then she never looks upon her lure.
	Another way I have to man my haggard,
	To make her come and know her keeper's call;
	That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
	That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
	She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
	Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not:
	As with the meat, some undeserved fault
	I'll find about the making of the bed;
	And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
	This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
	Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
	That all is done in reverend care of her;
	And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
	And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl,
	And with the clamour keep her still awake.
	This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
	And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
	He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
	Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

Enter Tranio and Hortensio.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
	Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
	I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

</TRANIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
	Stand by, and mark the manner of his teaching

They stand aside.

<LUCENTIO>

	Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

</LUCENTIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<DIRECTION>
They retire.
</DIRECTION>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
	You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca
	Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
	I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
	Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
	But one that scorns to live in this disguise,
	For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
	And makes a god of such a cullion:
	Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
	Of your entire affection to Bianca;
	And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
	I will with you, if you be so contented,
	Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
	Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
	Never to woo her more; but I do forswear her,
	As one unworthy all the former favours
	That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
	Never to marry with her though she would entreat.
	Fie on her! see how beastly she doth court him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would all the world, but he had quite forsworn!
	For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
	I will be married to a wealthy widow
	Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
	As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
	And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
	Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
	Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
	In resolution as I swore before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Hortensio. Lucentio and Bianca advance.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
	As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
	Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
	And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tranio, you jest. But have you both forsworn me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mistress, we have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we are rid of Licio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now, That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.

</TRANIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God give him joy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and he'll tame her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says so, Tranio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
	That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
	To tame a shrew, and charm her chattering tongue.

</TRANIO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Biondello, running.
</DIRECTION>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O master, master! I have watch'd so long

	An ancient angel coming down the hill
	Will serve the turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he, Biondello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
	I know not what; but formal in apparel,
	In gait and countenance surely like a father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what of him, Tranio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he be credulous and trust my tale,
	I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
	And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
	As if he were the right Vincentio.
	Take in your love, and then let me alone

<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.

Enter a Pedant.
</DIRECTION>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God save you, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, sir! you are welcome.
	Travel you far on, or are you at the furthest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, at the furthest for a week or two;
	But then up further, and as far as Rome;
	And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What countryman, I pray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of Mantua.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of Mantua, sir! marry, God forbid!
	And come to Padua, careless of your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis death for any one in Mantua
	To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
	Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the duke,--
	For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,--
	Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
	'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
	You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so;
	For I have bills for money by exchange
	From Florence, and must here deliver them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
	This will I do, and this I will advise you:
	First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been;
	Pisa, renowned for grave citizens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Among them, know you one Vincentio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know him not, but I have heard of him;
	A merchant of incomparable wealth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
	In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIONDELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Aside.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To save your life in this extremity,
	This favour will I do you for his sake;
	And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
	That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
	His name and credit shall you undertake,
	And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd,
	Look that you take upon you as you should!
	You understand me, sir; so shall you stay
	Till you have done your business in the city.
	If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
	The patron of my life and liberty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go with me to make the matter good.
	This, by the way, I let you understand:
	My father is here look'd for every day,
	To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
	'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
	In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
	Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

Exeunt.

Enter Katharina and Grumio.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, forsooth; I dare not, for my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more my wrong the more his spite appears.
	What, did he marry me to famish me?
	Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
	Upon entreaty have a present alms;
	If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
	But I, who never knew how to entreat,
	Nor never needed that I should entreat,
	Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
	With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed.
	And that which spites me more than all these wants,
	He does it under name of perfect love;
	As who should say, if I should sleep or eat
	'Twere deadly sickness, or else present death.
	I prithee go and get me some repast;
	I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What say you to a neat's foot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fear it is too choleric a meat.
	How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
	What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dish that I do love to feed upon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, then I will not: you shall have the mustard,
	Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<KATHARINA>

<DIRECTION>
Beats him.

Enter Petruchio with a dish of meat; and Hortensio.

	How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mistress, what cheer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<KATHARINA>

	Faith, as cold as can be.

Sets the dish on a table.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.

	Here, take away this dish.

<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, let it stand.

	The poorest service is repaid with thanks,

	I thank you, sir.

	Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lov'st me.
	Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
	Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
	Will we return unto thy father's house,
	And revel it as bravely as the best,
	With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
	With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things;
	With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
	With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
	What! hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
	To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure

	<DIALOGUE>
	What news with you, sir?
<HABERDASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HABERDASHER>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
	A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
	Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
	A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
	Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
	And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>

	When you are gentle, you shall have one too;

<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,
	And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
	Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
	And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
	My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
	Or else my heart, concealing it, will break:
	And rather than it shall, I will be free
	Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, thou sayst true; it is a paltry cap,
	A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.
	I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love me or love me not, I like the cap,

<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
	O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
	What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
	What! up and down, carv'd like an apple-tart?
	Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
	Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
	Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, and did: but if you be remember'd,
	I did not bid you mar it to the time.
	Go, hop me over every kennel home,

	I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
	More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.

<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

</TAILOR>
<PETRUCHIO>

	O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,

	Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
	Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
	Away! thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,
	Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
	As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
	I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your worship is deceiv'd: the gown is made
	Just as my master had direction.
	Grumio gave order how it should be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAILOR>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how did you desire it should be made?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAILOR>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But did you not request to have it cut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAILOR>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast faced many things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAILOR>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not me: I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAILOR>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read it.

</GRUMIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imprimis. A loose-bodied gown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAILOR>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread. I said, a gown.

<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, there's the villany.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<GRUMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill. I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUMIO>
<TAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is true that I say: an I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it.

	Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

	Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

</PETRUCHIO>

	O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
	Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!

	Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's,
	Even in these honest mean habiliments.
	Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor:
	For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
	And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
	So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
	What is the jay more precious than the lark
	Because his feathers are more beautiful?
	Or is the adder better than the eel
	Because his painted skin contents the eye?
	O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
	For this poor furniture and mean array.
	If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
	And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
	To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
	Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
	And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
	There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
	Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
	And well we may come there by dinner-time.
	</DIALOGUE>

	It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
	Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,

Enter Tranio, and the Pedant dressed like Vincentio.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, what else? and, but I be deceived,
	Signior Baptista may remember me,
	Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
	Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
	With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
	'Twere good he were school'd.

</PEDANT>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Biondello.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
	Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
	Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tut! fear not me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him that your father was at Venice,
	And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
	Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir

<DIRECTION>
Enter Baptista and Lucentio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Baptista, you are happily met
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To the Pedant.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
	I pray you, stand good father to me now,
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
	Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft, son!
	Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
	To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
	Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
	Of love between your daughter and himself:
	And,--for the good report I hear of you,
	And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
	And she to him,--to stay him not too long,
	I am content, in a good father's care,
	To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
	No worse than I, upon some agreement
	Me shall you find ready and willing
	With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
	For curious I cannot be with you,
	Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
	Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
	And therefore, if you say no more than this,
	That like a father you will deal with him
	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
	The match is made, and all is done:
	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you, sir. Where, then, do you know best
	We be affied and such assurance ta'en
	As shall with either part's agreement stand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
	Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,
	And happily we might be interrupted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then at my lodging an it like you:
	There doth my father lie, and there this night
	We'll pass the business privately and well.
	Send for your daughter by your servant here;
	My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
	The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
	You're like to have a thin and slender pittance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
	And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
	And, if you will, tell what hath happened:
	Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
	And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
	Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
	Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer.
	Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Biondello, what of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, nothing; but he has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray thee, moralize them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what of him?

</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>

</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then?

</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what of all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot tell, expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her, cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. To the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.
	If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say,
	But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.

	Hearest thou, Biondello?

	I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir; and so, adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.

<DIRECTION>
Enter Vincentio, in a travelling dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Vincentio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
	Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
	Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
	Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
	What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
	As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
	Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
	Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

</HORTENSIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
	Whither away, or where is thy abode?
	Happy the parents of so fair a child;
	Happier the man, whom favourable stars
	Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
	This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
	And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
	That have been so bedazzled with the sun
	That everything I look on seemeth green:
	Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
	Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
	Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
	We shall be joyful of thy company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
	That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,
	My name is called Vincentio; my dwelling, Pisa;
	And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
	A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENTIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is his name?

</PETRUCHIO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucentio, gentle sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENTIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happily met; the happier for thy son.
	And now by law, as well as reverend age,
	I may entitle thee my loving father:
	The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
	Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
	Nor be not griev'd: she is of good esteem,
	Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
	Beside, so qualified as may beseem
	The spouse of any noble gentleman.
	Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
	And wander we to see thy honest son,
	Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But is this true? or is it else your pleasure,
	Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
	Upon the company you overtake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENTIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do assure thee, father, so it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>

	Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
	For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt all but Hortensio.

	Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

</PEDANT>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to make merry withal?

</VINCENTIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall need none so long as I live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the window.

</PEDANT>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art thou his father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENTIO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
To Vincentio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, how now, gentleman! why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.

Re-enter Biondello.

</BIONDELLO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you notorious villain! didst thou never see thy master's father, Vincentio?

</VINCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, my old, worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir: see where he looks out of the window.

</TRANIO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! while I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.

	What, is the man lunatic?

</BAPTISTA>
<TRANIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANIO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
	</DIALOGUE>

	You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you think is his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<VINCENTIO>

	His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENTIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio; and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucentio! O! he hath murdered his master. Lay hold on him, I charge you in the duke's name. O my son, my son! tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.

</GREMIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<PEDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swear, if thou darest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDANT>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I dare not swear it.

</GREMIO>
<TRANIO>

	Then thou wert best say, that I am not Lucentio.

	Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

</BAPTISTA>
<LUCENTIO>

<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
	Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
	While he did bear my countenance in the town;
	And happily I have arriv'd at last
	Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
	What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
	Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,

	<DIALOGUE>
	Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
	And, as the jest did glance away from me,
	'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
	I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I say no: and therefore, for assurance,
	Let's each one send unto his wife;
	And he whose wife is most obedient
	To come at first when he doth send for her,
	Shall win the wager which we will propose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Content. What is the wager?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty crowns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty crowns!
	I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
	But twenty times so much upon my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Content.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A match! 'tis done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who shall begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That will I.
	Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, I will be your half, Bianca comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Biondello.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now! what news?
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, my mistress sends you word
	That she is busy and she cannot come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How! she is busy, and she cannot come!
	Is that an answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<GREMIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and a kind one too:
	Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREMIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope, better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
	To come to me forthwith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Biondello.
</DIRECTION>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O ho! entreat her!
	Nay, then she must needs come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am afraid, sir,
	Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Biondello.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, where's my wife?
<BIONDELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
	She will not come: she bids you come to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIONDELLO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
	Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
	Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress; say,
	I command her come to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Grumio.
</DIRECTION>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know her answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She will not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Katharina.
</DIRECTION>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, fetch them hither: if they deny to come,
	Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
	Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Katharina.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
	An awful rule and right supremacy;
	And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<BAPTISTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
	The wager thou hast won; and I will add
	Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
	Another dowry to another daughter,
	For she is chang'd, as she had never been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAPTISTA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
	And show more sign of her obedience,
	Her new-built virtue and obedience.
	See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
	As prisoners to her womanly persuasion
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Katharina, with Bianca and Widow.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katharine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
	Off with that bauble, throw it under foot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Katharina pulls off her cap, and throws it down.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord! let me never have a cause to sigh,
	Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would your duty were as foolish too:
	The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
	Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<BIANCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more fool you for laying on my duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIANCA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katharine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
	What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<WIDOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She shall not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say she shall: and first begin with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<KATHARINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
	And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
	To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
	It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
	Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
	And in no sense is meet or amiable.
	A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled,
	Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
	And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
	Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
	Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
	Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
	And for thy maintenance commits his body
	To painful labour both by sea and land,
	To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
	Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
	And craves no other tribute at thy hands
	But love, fair looks, and true obedience;
	Too little payment for so great a debt.
	Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
	Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
	And when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
	And not obedient to his honest will,
	What is she but a foul contending rebel,
	And graceless traitor to her loving lord?--
	I am asham'd that women are so simple
	To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
	Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
	When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
	Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,
	Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
	But that our soft conditions and our hearts
	Should well agree with our external parts?
	Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
	My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
	My heart as great, my reason haply more,
	To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
	But now I see our lances are but straws,
	Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
	That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
	Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
	And place your hands below your husband's foot:
	In token of which duty, if he please,
	My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHARINA>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETRUCHIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<VINCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENTIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<PETRUCHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
	We three are married, but you two are sped.
	'Twas I won the wager
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Lucentio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	though you hit the white;
	And, being a winner, God give you good night!

</PETRUCHIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt Petruchio and Katharina.
</DIRECTION>
<HORTENSIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORTENSIO>
<LUCENTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCENTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
