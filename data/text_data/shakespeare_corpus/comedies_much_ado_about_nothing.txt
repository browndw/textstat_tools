Scene.--Messina.
</DIRECTION>
<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
Before Leonato's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Leonato, Hero, Beatrice and others, with a Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But few of any sort, and none of name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he break out into tears?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In great measure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed: how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he that you ask for, niece?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it: he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a good soldier too, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honourable virtues.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must not, sir, mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her: they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is't possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Lord! he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a' be cured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will hold friends with you, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do, good friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will never run mad, niece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not till a hot January.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Pedro is approached.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick, Balthazar, and Others.
</DIRECTION>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her mother hath many times told me so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Benedick, no; for then you were a child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honourable father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God keep your ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such a face as yours were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's name; I have done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
To Don John.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please it your Grace lead on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noted her not; but I looked on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she not a modest young lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise: only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can the world buy such a jewel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is't come to this, i' faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Don Pedro.
</DIRECTION>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I charge thee on thy allegiance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace's part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato's short daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this were so, so were it uttered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor 'twas not so; but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my troth, I speak my thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I love her, I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That she is worthy, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,--for the which I may go the finer,--I will live a bachelor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder, and called Adam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, as time shall try:
	'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, 'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign 'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I look for an earthquake too then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My liege, your highness now may do me good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
	And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
	Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
	Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! my lord,
	When you went onward on this ended action,
	I looked upon her with a soldier's eye,
	That lik'd, but had a rougher task in hand
	Than to drive liking to the name of love;
	But now I am return'd, and that war-thoughts
	Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
	Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
	All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
	Saying, I lik'd her ere I went to wars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou wilt be like a lover presently,
	And tire the hearer with a book of words.
	If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
	And I will break with her, and with her father,
	And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
	That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How sweetly do you minister to love,
	That know love's grief by his complexion!
	But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
	I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
	The fairest grant is the necessity.
	Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lov'st,
	And I will fit thee with the remedy.
	I know we shall have revelling to-night:
	I will assume thy part in some disguise,
	And tell fair Hero I am Claudio;
	And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart,
	And take her hearing prisoner with the force
	And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
	Then, after to her father will I break;
	And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
	In practice let us put it presently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
A Room in Leonato's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Leonato and Antonio, meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreaint not of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and, if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you, and tell her of it
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Several persons cross the stage.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
</SCENE_2>
<SCENE_3>
<DIRECTION>
Another Room in Leonato's House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Don John and Conrade.
</DIRECTION>
<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should hear reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder that thou, being,--as thou say'st thou art,--born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man's business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you make no use of your discontent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<DON_JOHN>

	I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Borachio.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What news, Borachio?
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came yonder from a great supper: the prince, your brother, is royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even he.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?

</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw him not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is of a very melancholy disposition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing; and the other too like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if a' could get her good will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In faith, she's too curst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, go you into hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; but to the gate; and there will the devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<ANTONIO>
<DIRECTION>
To Hero.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy, and say, 'Father, as it please you:'--but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say, 'Father, as it please me.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.

	What's he?

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray you, what is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me!
	</DIALOGUE>

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>

	Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me; which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night

<CLAUDIO>

<CLAUDIO>

	Thus answer I in name of Benedick,
	But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
	'Tis certain so; the prince woos for himself.
	Friendship is constant in all other things
	Save in the office and affairs of love:
	Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;
	Let every eye negotiate for itself
	And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
	Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
	This is an accident of hourly proof,
	Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!

</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even to the next willow, about your own business, count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer's chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.

</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish him joy of her.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The prince's fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.

</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be whipped! What's his fault?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>

	Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>

	Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird's nest.

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it, would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the prince's jester; that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.

	Will your Grace command me any service to the world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John's foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham's beard; do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?

	Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.

<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so she doth, cousin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!

</BEATRICE>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would rather have one of your father's getting. Hath your Grace ne'er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you have me, lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!

	By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She were an excellent wife for Benedick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.

</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you too, gentle Hero?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me briefly how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting-gentlewoman to Hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber-window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the prince your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,--whose estimation do you mightily hold up,--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What proof shall I make of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato.
	Look you for any other issue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio, as--in love of your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero; hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.

	In my chamber-window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard.

<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am here already, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again. [Exit Boy.] I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known, when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour

</DON_PEDRO>
<BALTHAZAR>

	Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;

	'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her: 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him, I should.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>

</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.

</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>

	It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.

	To what end? he would but make a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what a' will say.

<LEONATO>

	Were it good, think you?

</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>

	Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the man,--as you know all,--hath a contemptible spirit.

</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>

</DON_PEDRO>

</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy to have so good a lady.

Aside.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumbshow. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems, her affections have their full bent. Love me! why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: 'tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: 'tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.

</BENEDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Beatrice.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take pleasure then in the message?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.

</BEATRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,' there's a double meaning in that. 'I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,' that's as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture

<DIRECTION>
Enter Hero, Margaret, and Ursula.
</DIRECTION>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour;
	There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
	Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
	Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursula
	Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
	Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us,
	And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
	Where honey-suckles, ripen'd by the sun,
	Forbid the sun to enter; like favourites,
	Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
	Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her,
	To listen our propose. This is thy office;
	Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
	As we do trace this alley up and down,
	Our talk must only be of Benedick:
	When I do name him, let it be thy part
	To praise him more than ever man did merit.
	My talk to thee must be how Benedick
	Is sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter
	Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
	That only wounds by hearsay
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Beatrice, behind.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now begin;
	For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
	Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
	Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
	And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
	So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
	Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
	Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
	Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They advance to the bower.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
	I know her spirits are as coy and wild
	As haggerds of the rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But are you sure
	That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So says the prince, and my new-trothed lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
	But I persuaded them, if they lov'd Benedick,
	To wish him wrestle with affection,
	And never to let Beatrice know of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
	Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
	As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O god of love! I know he doth deserve
	As much as may be yielded to a man;
	But nature never fram'd a woman's heart
	Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
	Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
	Misprising what they look on, and her wit
	Values itself so highly, that to her
	All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
	Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
	She is so self-endear'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I think so;
	And therefore certainly it were not good
	She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
	How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur'd,
	But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac'd,
	She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
	If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,
	Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
	If low, an agate very vilely cut;
	If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
	If silent, why, a block moved with none.
	So turns she every man the wrong side out,
	And never gives to truth and virtue that
	Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; not to be so odd and from all fashions
	As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
	But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
	She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me
	Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
	Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
	Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
	It were a better death than die with mocks,
	Which is as bad as die with tickling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; rather I will go to Benedick,
	And counsel him to fight against his passion.
	And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
	To stain my cousin with. One doth not know
	How much an ill word may empoison liking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! do not do your cousin such a wrong.
	She cannot be so much without true judgment,--
	Having so swift and excellent a wit
	As she is priz'd to have,--as to refuse
	So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

	Always excepted my dear Claudio.

	I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
	Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
	For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
	Goes foremost in report through Italy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
	When are you married, madam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
	I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
	Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.

	She's lim'd, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.

Advancing.

	What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
	Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
	Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
	No glory lives behind the back of such.
	And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
	Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
	If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
	To bind our loves up in a holy band;
	For others say thou dost deserve, and I
	Believe it better than reportingly.

	I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gallants, I am not as I have been.

	So say I: methinks you are sadder.

</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope he be in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in him, to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the tooth-ache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>

</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang it.

<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! sigh for the tooth-ache?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is but a humour or a worm?

</LEONATO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet say I, he is in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be a Dutchman to-day, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs: a' brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him; and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when was he wont to wash his face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a lute-string, and new-governed by stops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, but I know who loves him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She shall be buried with her face upwards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>

	Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache.
	Old signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear.

</CLAUDIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent, and labour ill bestowed!

	Why, what's the matter?

	Who, Hero?

</DON_JOHN>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disloyal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The word's too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall see her chamber-window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you love her then, to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour to change your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May this be so?

</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>

	I will not think it.

</DON_JOHN>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow, in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.

	And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.

<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you good men and true?

</DOGBERRY>
<VERGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERGES>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the prince's watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<VERGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERGES>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<WATCH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCH_1>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<WATCH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both which, Master constable,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCH_2>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<WATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How, if a' will not stand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCH>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<VERGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the prince's subjects.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERGES>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, and they are to meddle with none but the prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<WATCH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCH_2>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<WATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How if they will not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCH>
<DOGBERRY>

	Well, sir.

	If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<WATCH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATCH_2>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is, to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company.

<VERGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been always called a merciful man, partner.

	If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.

	Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never answer a calf when he bleats.

	'Tis very true.

<DOGBERRY>

	This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the prince's own person: if you meet the prince in the night, you may stay him.

<VERGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, by 'r lady, that I think, a' cannot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERGES>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows the statues, he may stay him: marry, not without the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against his will.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<BORACHIO>

	Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.

<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<BORACHIO>

	That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.

<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is apparel.

	No: 'twas the vane on the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers in the reechy painting; sometime like god Bel's priests in the old church-window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his cod-piece seems as massy as his club?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so, neither; but know, that I have to-night wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress' chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first tell thee how the prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.

</BORACHIO>
<CONRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And thought they Margaret was Hero?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONRADE>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the devil my master, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night, and send her home again without a husband.

<MARGARET>

	By my troth's not so good; and I warrant your cousin will say so.

	My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear none but this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so.

<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! that exceeds, they say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my troth's but a night-gown in respect of yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts round, underborne with a bluish tinsel; but for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't.

	Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? is not marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord honourable without marriage? I think you would have me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend nobody. Is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband?' None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.

	Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus, and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There thou prick'st her with a thistle.

<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in this Benedictus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think, perchance, that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor, indeed, I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man: he swore he would never marry; and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging: and how you may be converted, I know not; but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.

<DOGBERRY>

<LEONATO>

	Neighbours, you are tedious.

</LEONATO>
<DOGBERRY>

	It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.

	All thy tediousness on me! ha?

</LEONATO>
<DOGBERRY>

	A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, 'when the age is in, the wit is out.' God help us! it is a world to see! Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread: but God is to be worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.

	Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
	There, Leonato, take her back again:
	Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
	She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
	Behold! how like a maid she blushes here.
	O! what authority and show of truth
	Can cunning sin cover itself withal.
	Comes not that blood as modest evidence
	To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
	All you that see her, that she were a maid,
	By these exterior shows? But she is none:
	She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
	Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

	Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
	Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
	And made defeat of her virginity,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you would say: if I have known her,
	You'll say she did embrace me as a husband,
	And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
	No, Leonato,
	I never tempted her with word too large;
	But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
	Bashful sincerity and comely love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
	You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
	As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
	But you are more intemperate in your blood
	Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
	That rage in savage sensuality.

	All this is so; but what of this, my lord?

</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>

	That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

	What kind of catechizing call you this?

	Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
	With any just reproach?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, that can Hero:
	Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
	What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
	Out at your window, betwixt twelve and one?
	Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
	I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
	Myself, my brother, and this grieved count,
	Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night,
	Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window;
	Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
	Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
	A thousand times in secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<DON_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fie, fie! they are not to be nam'd, my lord,
	Not to be spoke of;
	There is not chastity enough in language
	Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
	I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_JOHN>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been,
	If half thy outward graces had been plac'd
	About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
	But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
	Thou pure impiety, and impious purity!
	For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
	And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
	To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
	And never shall it more be gracious.

<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand:

<FRIAR_FRANCIS>

	Have comfort, lady.

</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou look up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea; wherefore should she not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
	Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
	The story that is printed in her blood?
	Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes;
	For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
	Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
	Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
	Strike at thy life. Griev'd I, I had but one?
	Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
	O! one too much by thee. Why had I one?
	Why ever wast thou lovely in mine eyes?
	Why had I not with charitable hand
	Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
	Who smirched thus, and mir'd with infamy,
	I might have said, 'No part of it is mine;
	This shame derives itself from unknown loins?'
	But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd,
	And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
	That I myself was to myself not mine,
	Valuing of her; why, she--O! she is fallen
	Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
	Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,
	And salt too little which may season give
	To her foul-tainted flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, sir, be patient.
	For my part, I am so attir'd in wonder,
	I know not what to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! on my soul, my cousin is belied!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, truly, not; although, until last night,
	I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confirm'd, confirm'd! O! that is stronger made,
	Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron.
	Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie,
	Who lov'd her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
	Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me a little;
	For I have only been silent so long,
	And given way unto this course of fortune,
	By noting of the lady: I have mark'd
	A thousand blushing apparitions
	To start into her face; a thousand innocent shames
	In angel whiteness bear away those blushes;
	And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
	To burn the errors that these princess hold
	Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
	Trust not my reading nor my observations,
	Which with experimental seal doth warrant
	The tenour of my book; trust not my age,
	My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
	If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
	Under some biting error.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friar, it cannot be.
	Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
	Is, that she will not add to her damnation
	A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
	Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
	That which appears in proper nakedness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, what man is he you are accus'd of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<HERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They know that do accuse me, I know none;
	If I know more of any man alive
	Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
	Let all my sins lack mercy! O, my father!
	Prove you that any man with me convers'd
	At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
	Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
	Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is some strange misprision in the princes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two of them have the very bent of honour;
	And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
	The practice of it lives in John the bastard,
	Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
	These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
	The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
	Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine.
	Nor age so eat up my invention,
	Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
	Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
	But they shall find, awak'd in such a kind,
	Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
	Ability in means and choice of friends,
	To quit me of them throughly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pause awhile,
	And let my counsel sway you in this case.
	Your daughter here the princes left for dead;
	Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
	And publish it that she is dead indeed:
	Maintain a mourning ostentation;
	And on your family's old monument
	Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
	That appertain unto a burial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What shall become of this? What will this do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
	Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
	But not for that dream I on this strange course,
	But on this travail look for greater birth.
	She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
	Upon the instant that she was accus'd,
	Shall be lamented, pitied and excus'd
	Of every hearer; for it so falls out
	That what we have we prize not to the worth
	Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
	Why, then we rack the value, then we find
	The virtue that possession would not show us
	Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
	When he shall hear she died upon his words,
	The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
	Into his study of imagination,
	And every lovely organ of her life
	Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
	More moving-delicate, and full of life
	Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
	Than when she liv'd indeed: then shall he mourn,--
	If ever love had interest in his liver,--
	And wish he had not so accused her,
	No, though he thought his accusation true.
	Let this be so, and doubt not but success
	Will fashion the event in better shape
	Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
	But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
	The supposition of the lady's death
	Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
	And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,--
	As best befits her wounded reputation,--
	In some reclusive and religious life,
	Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
	And though you know my inwardness and love
	Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
	Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
	As secretly and justly as your soul
	Should with your body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being that I flow in grief,
	The smallest twine may lead me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis well consented: presently away;
	For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
	Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day
	Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not desire that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no reason; I do it freely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.

	Ah! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her.

	I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As strange as the thing I know not.
	It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as your, but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, not I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.

	Do not swear by it, and eat it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you not eat your word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And do it with all thy heart.

</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>

	Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me, Beatrice,--

</BENEDICK>

	Nay, but Beatrice,--

<BEATRICE>

</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beat--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly Count Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake, or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.

	Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead; and so, farewell.

	And this is more, masters, than you can deny.

Enter Leonato and Antonio.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you go on thus, you will kill yourself;
	And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
	Against yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
	Which falls into mine ears as profitless
	As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
	Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
	But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine:
	Bring me a father that so lov'd his child,
	Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
	And bid him speak of patience;
	Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,
	And let it answer every strain for strain,
	As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
	In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
	If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard;
	Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan,
	Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk
	With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
	And I of him will gather patience.
	But there is no such man; for, brother, men
	Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
	Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
	Their counsel turns to passion, which before
	Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
	Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
	Charm ache with air and agony with words.
	No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
	To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
	But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
	To be so moral when he shall endure
	The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
	My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>

	Marry, beshrew my hand,

	In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me:
	I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
	As, under privilege of age, to brag
	What I have done being young, or what would do,
	Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
	Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
	That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by,
	And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
	Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
	I say thou hast belied mine innocent child:
	Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
	And she lies buried with her ancestors;
	O! in a tomb where never scandal slept,
	Save this of hers, fram'd by thy villany!

	He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:

	Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,

	Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
	That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
	Go antickly, show outward hideousness,

</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, my lord.

<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is in my scabbard; shall I draw it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an you charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.

	You are a villain; I jest not: I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.

	Shall I not find a woodcock too?

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. 'True,' says she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.' 'Right,' said she, 'a great gross one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit.' 'Just,' said she, 'it hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise.' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues.' 'That I believe,' said she. 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's daughter told us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the married man!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him.

<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.

<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hearken after their offence, my lord.

</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officers, what offence have these men done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>

	Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? this learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What's your offence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet prince, let me go no further to mine answer: do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments; how you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villany they have upon record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But did my brother set thee on to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery:
	And fled he is upon this villany.

	Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
	In the rare semblance that I lov'd it first.

	Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.

<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, even I alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
	Here stand a pair of honourable men;
	A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
	I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death
	Record it with your high and worthy deeds.
	'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know not how to pray your patience;
	Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
	Impose me to what penance your invention
	Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
	But in mistaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By my soul, nor I:
	And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
	I would bend under any heavy weight
	That he'll enjoin me to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DON_PEDRO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
	That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
	Possess the people in Messina here
	How innocent she died; and if your love
	Can labour aught in sad invention,
	Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,
	And sing it to her bones: sing it to-night.
	To-morrow morning come you to my house,
	And since you could not be my son-in-law,
	Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,
	Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
	And she alone is heir to both of us:

<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O noble sir,
	Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
	I do embrace your offer; and dispose
	For henceforth of poor Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
	To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
	Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
	Who, I believe, was pack'd in all this wrong,
	Hir'd to it by your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BORACHIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, by my soul she was not;
	Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me;
	But always hath been just and virtuous
	In anything that I do know by her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORACHIO>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moreover, sir,--which, indeed, is not under white and black,--this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's name, the which he hath used so long and never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God's sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOGBERRY>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DOGBERRY>

	Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth, and I praise God for you.

</DOGBERRY>
<LEONATO>

	There's for thy pains.

	Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<DOGBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your worship to corect yourself, for the example of others. God keep your worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit, but hurt not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And therefore will come
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit Margaret.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The god of love,
	That sits above,
	And knows me, and knows me,
	How pitiful I deserve,--
	I mean, in singing; but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of pandars, and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self, in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent rime; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rime; for 'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Beatrice.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yea, signior; and depart when you bid me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, stay but till then!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For them all together; which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Suffer love,' a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It appears not in this confession: there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how long is that think you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum: therefore it is most expedient for the wise,--if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,--to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very ill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very ill too.
	</DIALOGUE>

Enter Ursula.
</DIRECTION>
<URSULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?
	</DIALOGUE>
</URSULA>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you go hear this news, signior?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle's.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Done to death by slanderous tongues
	Was the Hero that here lies:
	Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
	Gives her fame which never dies.
	So the life that died with shame
	Lives in doath with glorious fame.
	Hang thou there upon the tomb,
	Praising her when I am dumb.
	Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
<SONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon, goddess of the night,
	Those that slew thy virgin knight;
	For the which, with songs of woe,
	Round about her tomb they go.
	Midnight, assist our moan;
	Help us to sigh and groan,
	Heavily, heavily:
	Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
	Till death be uttered,
	Heavily, heavily.

	Now, unto thy bones good night!
	Yearly will I do this rite.

<DON_PEDRO>

	Good morrow, masters: put your torches out.

	Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well

<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I not tell you she was innocent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are the prince and Claudio, who accus'd her
	Upon the error that you heard debated:
	But Margaret was in some fault for this,
	Although against her will, as it appears
	In the true course of all the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd
	To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
	Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
	And when I send for you, come hither mask'd:
	The prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour
	To visit me
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt ladies.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know your office, brother;
	You must be father to your brother's daughter,
	And give her to young Claudio.

</LEONATO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To do what, signior?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIAR_FRANCIS>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
	Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
	Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I do with an eye of love requite her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sight whereof I think, you had from me,
	From Claudio, and the prince. But what's your will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
	But, for my will, my will is your good will
	May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
	In the state of honourable marriage:
	In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiop.

<DON_PEDRO>

	Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,

	So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?

</DON_PEDRO>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
	Tush! fear not, man, we'll tip thy horns with gold,
	And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
	As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
	When he would play the noble beast in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low:
	And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
	And got a calf in that same noble feat,
	Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIO>
<LEONATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
	Before this friar, and swear to marry her.

<DON_PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

	She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONATO>
<FRIAR_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All this amazement can I qualify:
	When after that the holy rites are ended,

	Why, no; no more than reason.

<BENEDICK>

	Why, then, your uncle and the prince and Claudio

<BEATRICE>

	Do not you love me?

	Why, then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula,
	Are much deceiv'd; for they did swear you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They swore that you were almost sick for me.

</LEONATO>
<CLAUDIO>

</DON_PEDRO>
<BENEDICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No; if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICK>
<CLAUDIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.
