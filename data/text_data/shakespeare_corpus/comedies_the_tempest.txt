Scene.--The Sea, with a Ship; afterwards an Island.
</DIRECTION>
<ACT_1>
<SCENE_1>
<DIRECTION>
On a Ship at Sea. A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain severally.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boatswain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, master: what cheer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<MASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't yarely, or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
</MASTER>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Mariners.
</DIRECTION>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle.--Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo, and others.
</DIRECTION>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray now, keep below.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the master, boson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, good, be patient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.--Cheerly, good hearts!--Out of our way, I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging! make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
</GONZALO>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Boatswain.
</DIRECTION>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A cry within.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather, or our office.--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Re-enter Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet again? what do you here? Shall we give o'er, and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work you, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang, cur, hang! you whoreson, insolent noisemaker, we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses; off to sea again; lay her off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Mariners, wet.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Exeunt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, must our mouths be cold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATSWAIN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The king and prince at prayers! let us assist them,
	For our case is as theirs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am out of patience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.--
	This wide-chapp'd rascal,--would thou might'st lie drowning,
	The washing of ten tides!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be hang'd yet,
	Though every drop of water swear against it,
	And gape at wid'st to glut him
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A confused noise within,--'Mercy on us!'--
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'--
	'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'--]
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's all sink wi' the king.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take leave of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground; long heath, brown furze, any thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a dry death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<DIRECTION>
Exit.
</DIRECTION>
</SCENE_1>
<SCENE_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Island: before the Cell of Prospero.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Prospero and Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If by your art, my dearest father, you have
	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
	But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
	Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffer'd
	With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
	Who had, no doubt, some noble creatures in her,
	Dash'd all to pieces. O! the cry did knock
	Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
	Had I been any god of power, I would
	Have sunk the sea within the earth, or e'er
	It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
	The fraughting souls within her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be collected:
	No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
	There's no harm done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, woe the day!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No harm.
	I have done nothing but in care of thee,--
	Of thee, my dear one! thee, my daughter!--who
	Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
	Of whence I am: nor that I am more better
	Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
	And thy no greater father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More to know
	Did never meddle with my thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis time
	I should inform thee further. Lend thy hand,
	And pluck my magic garment from me.--So
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Lays down his mantle.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie there, my art.--Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
	The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch'd
	The very virtue of compassion in thee,
	I have with such provision in mine art
	So safely order'd, that there is no soul--
	No, not so much perdition as an hair,
	Betid to any creature in the vessel
	Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
	For thou must now know further.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have often
	Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd,
	And left me to a bootless inquisition,
	Concluding, 'Stay; not yet.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hour's now come,
	The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
	Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
	A time before we came unto this cell?
	I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
	Out three years old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly, sir, I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By what? by any other house or person?
	Of anything the image tell me, that
	Hath kept with thy remembrance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis far off;
	And rather like a dream than an assurance
	That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
	Four or five women once that tended me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
	That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
	In the dark backward and abysm of time?
	If thou remember'st aught ere thou cam'st here,
	How thou cam'st here, thou may'st.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that I do not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
	Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
	A prince of power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, are not you my father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
	She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
	Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir
	A princess,--no worse issued.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, the heavens!
	What foul play had we that we came from thence?
	Or blessed was't we did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both, both, my girl:
	By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;
	But blessedly holp hither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! my heart bleeds
	To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
	Which is from my remembrance. Please you, further.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio,--
	I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should
	Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself,
	Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put
	The manage of my state; as at that time,
	Through all the signiories it was the first,
	And Prospero the prime duke; being so reputed
	In dignity, and for the liberal arts,
	Without a parallel: those being all my study,
	The government I cast upon my brother,
	And to my state grew stranger, being transported
	And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
	Dost thou attend me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, most heedfully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being once perfected how to grant suits,
	How to deny them, who t'advance, and who
	To trash for over-topping; new created
	The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,
	Or else new form'd 'em: having both the key
	Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
	To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was
	The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
	And suck'd my verdure out on't.--Thou attend'st not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, good sir! I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray thee, mark me.
	I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
	To closeness and the bettering of my mind
	With that, which, but by being so retir'd,
	O'erpriz'd all popular rate, in my false brother
	Awak'd an evil nature; and my trust,
	Like a good parent, did beget of him
	A falsehood in its contrary as great
	As my trust was; which had, indeed no limit,
	A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
	Not only with what my revenue yielded,
	But what my power might else exact,--like one,
	Who having, into truth, by telling of it,
	Made such a sinner of his memory,
	To credit his own lie,--he did believe
	He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,
	And executing th' outward face of royalty,
	With all prerogative:--Hence his ambition growing,--
	Dost thou hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To have no screen between this part he play'd
	And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
	Absolute Milan. Me, poor man,--my library
	Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
	He thinks me now incapable; confederates,--
	So dry he was for sway,--wi' the king of Naples
	To give him annual tribute, do him homage;
	Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
	The dukedom, yet unbow'd,--alas, poor Milan!--
	To most ignoble stooping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O the heavens!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
	If this might be a brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should sin
	To think but nobly of my grandmother:
	Good wombs have borne bad sons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the condition.
	This King of Naples, being an enemy
	To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
	Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
	Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
	Should presently extirpate me and mine
	Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
	With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
	A treacherous army levied, one midnight
	Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
	The gates of Milan; and, i' the dead of darkness,
	The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
	Me and thy crying self.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack, for pity!
	I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,
	Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint,
	That wrings mine eyes to 't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear a little further,
	And then I'll bring thee to the present business
	Which now's upon us; without the which this story
	Were most impertinent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherefore did they not
	That hour destroy us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well demanded, wench:
	My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
	So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
	A mark so bloody on the business; but
	With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
	In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
	Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepar'd
	A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
	Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
	Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
	To cry to the sea that roar'd to us; to sigh
	To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
	Did us but loving wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alack! what trouble
	Was I then to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, a cherubin
	Thou wast, that did preserve me! Thou didst smile,
	Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
	When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
	Under my burden groan'd; which rais'd in me
	An undergoing stomach, to bear up
	Against what should ensue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How came we ashore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Providence divine.
	Some food we had and some fresh water that
	A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
	Out of his charity,--who being then appointed
	Master of this design,--did give us; with
	Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,
	Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
	Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me,
	From mine own library with volumes that
	I prize above my dukedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I might
	But ever see that man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I arise:-
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Resumes his mantle.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
	Here in this island we arriv'd; and here
	Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
	Than other princes can, that have more time
	For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,--
	For still 'tis beating in my mind,--your reason
	For raising this sea-storm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know thus far forth.
	By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
	Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
	Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
	I find my zenith doth depend upon
	A most auspicious star, whose influence
	If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
	Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions;
	Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
	And give it way;--I know thou canst not choose.-
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sleeps.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come away, servant, come! I'm ready now.
	Approach, my Ariel; come!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Ariel.
</DIRECTION>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
	To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
	To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
	On the curl'd clouds: to thy strong bidding task
	Ariel and all his quality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hast thou, spirit,
	Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To every article.
	I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
	Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
	I flam'd amazement: sometime I'd divide
	And burn in many places; on the topmast,
	The yards, and boresprit, would I flame distinctly,
	Then meet, and join: Jove's lightnings, the precursors
	O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
	And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks
	Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
	Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
	Yea, his dread trident shake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brave spirit!
	Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
	Would not infect his reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a soul
	But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
	Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners,
	Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
	Then all a-fire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
	With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
	Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty,
	And all the devils are here.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that's my spirit!
	But was not this nigh shore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close by, my master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But are they, Ariel, safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a hair perish'd;
	On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
	But fresher than before: and, as thou bad'st me,
	In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.
	The king's son have I landed by himself;
	Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
	In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
	His arms in this sad knot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of the king's ship
	The mariners, say how thou hast dispos'd,
	And all the rest o' the fleet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Safely in harbour
	Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
	Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
	From the still-vex'd Bermoothes; there she's hid:
	The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
	Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
	I have left asleep: and for the rest o' the fleet
	Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,
	And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
	Bound sadly home for Naples,
	Supposing that they saw the king's ship wrack'd,
	And his great person perish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ariel, thy charge
	Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work:
	What is the time o' th' day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Past the mid season.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
	Must by us both be spent most preciously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
	Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd
	Which is not yet perform'd me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now! moody?
	What is't thou canst demand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My liberty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before the time be out? no more!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSPERO>
<ARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prithee
	Remember, I have done thee worthy service;
	Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv'd
	Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
	To bate me a full year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARIEL>
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dost thou forget
	From what a torment I did free thee?

	This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child
	And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
	As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant:
	And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
	To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
	Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
	By help of her more potent ministers,
	And in her most unmitigable rage,
	Into a cloven pine; within which rift
	Imprison'd, thou didst painfully remain
	A dozen years; within which space she died
	And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
	As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island,--
	Save for the son that she did litter here,
	A freckled whelp hag-born,--not honour'd with
	A human shape.

	Dull thing, I say so; he that Caliban,
	Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
	What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
	Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
	Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
	To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
	Could not again undo; it was mine art,
	When I arriv'd and heard thee, that made gape
	The pine, and let thee out.

</ADRIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could not miss it.

</ANTONIO>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Temperance was a delicate wench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is everything advantageous to life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True; save means to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of that there's none, or little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ground indeed is tawny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With an eye of green in't.

</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He misses not much.

</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost beyond credit,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As many vouch'd rarities are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses; being rather new-dyed than stain'd with salt water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks, our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not since widow Dido's time.

</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in? Widow Dido!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if he had said, widower Aeneas too? Good Lord, how you take it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Widow Dido, said you? you make me study of that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carthage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assure you, Carthage.

<ANTONIO>

	His word is more than the miraculous harp.

<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What impossible matter will he make easy next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, in good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
<DIRECTION>
To Alon.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the rarest that e'er came there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! widow Dido; ay, widow Dido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sort was well fish'd for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cram these words into mine ears, against
	The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
	Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
	My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,
	Who is so far from Italy remov'd,
	I ne'er again shall see her. O thou, mine heir
	Of Naples and of Milan! what strange fish
	Hath made his meal on thee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<FRANCISCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, he may live:
	I saw him beat the surges under him,
	And ride upon their backs: he trod the water,
	Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
	The surge most swoln that met him: his bold head
	'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
	Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
	To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
	As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt
	He came alive to land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCISCO>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no; he's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
	That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
	But rather lose her to an African;
	Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
	Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were kneel'd to and importun'd otherwise
	By all of us; and the fair soul herself
	Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
	Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son,
	I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
	More widows in them of this business' making,
	Than we bring men to comfort them: the fault's
	Your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So is the dearest of the loss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord Sebastian,
	The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
	And time to speak it in; you rub the sore,
	When you should bring the plaster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And most chirurgeonly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
	When you are cloudy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Foul weather?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very foul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd sow't with nettle-seed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>

	Or docks, or mallows.

	'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
	Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
	Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
	Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
	And use of service, none; contract, succession,
	Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
	No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
	No occupation; all men idle, all;
	And women too, but innocent and pure;
	No sovereignty,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet he would be king on't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All things in common nature should produce
	Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
	Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
	Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
	Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
	To feed my innocent people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No marrying 'mong his subjects?

</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I would with such perfection govern, sir,

<ALONSO>

	Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Twas you we laugh'd at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a blow was there given!

<SEBASTIAN>

</SEBASTIAN>
<GONZALO>

</GONZALO>
<DIRECTION>
Enter Ariel, invisible, playing solemn music.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZALO>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go sleep, and hear us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<DIRECTION>
All sleep but Alon., Seb., and Ant.
</DIRECTION>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
	Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
	They are inclin'd to do so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please you, sir,
	Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
	It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth
	It is a comforter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We two, my lord,
	Will guard your person while you take your rest,
	And watch your safety.

</ANTONIO>
<ALONSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<DIRECTION>
Alonson sleeps. Exit Ariel.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the quality o' the climate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why
	Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
	Myself dispos'd to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nor I: my spirits are nimble.
	They fell together all, as by consent;
	They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
	Worthy Sebastian? O! what might?--No more:--
	And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
	What thou should'st be. The occasion speaks thee; and
	My strong imagination sees a crown
	Dropping upon thy head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What! art thou waking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you not hear me speak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do; and surely,
	It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st
	Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
	This is a strange repose, to be asleep
	With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
	And yet so fast asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noble Sebastian,
	Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die rather; wink'st
	Whiles thou art waking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou dost snore distinctly:
	There's meaning in thy snores.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am more serious than my custom: you
	Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
	Trebles thee o'er.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well; I am standing water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll teach you how to flow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do so: to ebb,
	Hereditary sloth instructs me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O!
	If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
	Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
	You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
	Most often do so near the bottom run
	By their own fear or sloth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prithee, say on:
	The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
	A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
	Which throes thee much to yield.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus, sir:
	Although this lord of weak remembrance, this
	Who shall be of as little memory
	When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded,--
	For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
	Professes to persuade,--the king, his son's alive,
	'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
	As he that sleeps here swims.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no hope
	That he's undrown'd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O! out of that 'no hope
	What great hope have you! no hope that way is
	Another way so high a hope that even
	Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
	But doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me
	That Ferdinand is drown'd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then tell me
	Who's the next heir of Naples?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claribel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She that is Queen of Tums; she that dwells
	Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
	Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
	The man i' th' moon's too slow--till new-born chins
	Be rough and razorable: she that, from whom?
	We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
	And by that destiny to perform an act
	Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
	In yours and my discharge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What stuff is this!--How say you?
	'Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
	So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
	There is some space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A space whose every cubit
	Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
	Measure us back to Naples?--Keep in Tunis,
	And let Sebastian wake!'--Say, this were death
	That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse
	Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
	As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
	As amply and unnecessarily
	As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
	A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
	The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
	For your advancement! Do you understand me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Methinks I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how does your content
	Tender your own good fortune?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember
	You did supplant your brother Prospero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True:
	And look how well my garments sit upon me;
	Much feater than before; my brother's servants
	Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, for your conscience,--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, sir; where lies that? if it were a kibe,
	'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
	This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
	That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they,
	And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
	No better than the earth he lies upon,
	If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
	Whom I, with this obedient steel,--three inches of it,--
	Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
	To the perpetual wink for aye might put
	This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
	Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
	They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
	They'll tell the clock to any business that
	We say befits the hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy case, dear friend,
	Shall be my precedent: as thou got'st Milan,
	I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
	Shall free thee from the tribute which thou pay'st,
	And I the king shall love thee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Draw together;
	And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
	To fall it on Gonzalo.

<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whiles we stood here securing your repose,

</ALONSO>
<GONZALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
	And that a strange one too, which did awake me.
	I shak'd you, sir, and cry'd; as mine eyes open'd,

	That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
	Or that we quit this place: let's draw our weapons.
	</DIALOGUE>

	All the infections that the sun sucks up

	Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire,
	Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
	Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
	For every trifle are they set upon me:
	Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me
	And after bite me; then like hedge-hogs, which

	Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls.--What have we here? a man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,--as once I was,--and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer; this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt

	Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
	One dowle that's in my plume; my fellow-ministers
	Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
	Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
	And will not be uplifted. But, remember,--
	For that's my business to you,--that you three
	From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
	Expos'd unto the sea, which hath requit it,
	Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
	The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
	Incens'd the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
	Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
	They have bereft; and do pronounce, by me,
	Lingering perdition,--worse than any death
	Can be at once,--shall step by step attend
	You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--

	Advanc'd their eyelids, lifted up their noses
	As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
	That, calf-like, they my lowing follow'd through
	Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,

	Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
	Him, that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo:'

	Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art?
	Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
	Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
	Do I take part: the rarer action is
	In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
	The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
	Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.

	No, my dearest love,

	What is this maid, with whom thou wast at play?
	Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:

	And brought us thus together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<FERDINAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, she is mortal;
	But by immortal Providence she's mine;
	I chose her when I could not ask my father
	For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
	Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
	Of whom so often I have heard renown,
	But never saw before; of whom I have
	Receiv'd a second life; and second father
	This lady makes him to me.

	I am hers:

	Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
	Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
	Beyond a common joy, and set it down
	With gold on lasting pillars. In one voyage
	Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
	And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
	Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom
	In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves,
	When no man was his own.

	O look, sir! look, sir! here are more of us.

</GONZALO>
	Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best news is that we have safely found

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALONSO>
<BOATSWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
	I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
	And,--how we know not,--all clapp'd under hatches,
	Where, but even now, with strange and several noises
	Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
	And mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,
	We were awak'd; straightway, at liberty:
	Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
	Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master
	Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
	Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
	And were brought moping hither.

	Sir, my liege,

	Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,

	And deal in her command without her power.
	These three have robb'd me; and this demidevil,--

	Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
	I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
	Where I have hope to see the nuptial
	Of these our dear-beloved solemniz'd;
	And thence retire me to my Milan, where
	Every third thought shall be my grave.

<Spoken_by> 
<PROSPERO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
	And what strength I have's mine own;
	Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
	I must be here confin'd by you,
	Or sent to Naples Let me not,
	Since I have my dukedom got
	And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
	In this bare island by your spell;
	But release me from my bands
	With the help of your good hands.
	Gentle breath of yours my sails
	Must fill, or else my project fails,
	Which was to please. Now I want
	Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;
	And my ending is despair,
	Unless I be reliev'd by prayer,
	Which pierces so that it assaults
	Mercy itself and frees all faults.
	As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
	Let your indulgence set me free.
