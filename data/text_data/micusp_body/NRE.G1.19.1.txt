Given its polarizing nature and place in the public eye, the Senate debate over drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has many actors involved. These actors are not just concerned with whether to allow drilling off the coast or not, but which regions to allow drilling in, what the role of states should be, and how far close to shore to allow drilling. Other peripheral issues have also been attached to OCS drilling in the Senate, including alternative energy development, nuclear energy, and whether to repeal a royalty relief tax break for oil companies already drilling off the coast. Some of the key actors are listed below (non-governmental actors first), along with a brief description of why the issue is important to them and what resources they have to influence decision-making. This is followed by a paragraph describing the relevant action channels.
The key action channel for this issue is the ENR committee. Any bill involving OCS drilling will be sent to this committee, where it will either be considered and eventually passed along to the full Senate or simply discarded. The full Senate is another, secondary action channel, but a decision can only be made on the floor if the ENR committee allows it. Of the actors mentioned here, Jeff Bingaman has the best access to the action channel. In fact, as the chair of the ENR committee, he effectively controls the action channel and what decisions will be made. Several members of the Gang of 10 and Mel Martinez of Florida are members of the committee, giving them direct access to the action channel. Members of the Senate who are not part of this committee only have indirect access to this channel, limited to the extent that they have influence over the committee members. Non-government actors also have limited access to this action channel, based on their ability to influence committee members through lobbying and campaign contributions.
