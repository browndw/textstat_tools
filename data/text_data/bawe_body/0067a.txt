A ~5kb sequence from a bacteriophage that infects Synechococcus was analysed and found to contain five open reading frames whose translated products showed homology to other proteins in the databases. Genes homologous to gp13, gp14, gp15 and gp16 from bacteriophage T4 were identified, of which gps13-15 are structural proteins and gp16 is the small subunit of the DNA transferase enzyme. A gene that is likely to encode a transcriptional regulatory protein was also identified. Structural elements of these proteins were predicted. "Bioinformatics is a new area, comprising the analysis of biological sequence information, recovery of evolutionary patterns, prediction of gene function, biological data mining and "silicon-based biology"." There are now many freely available tools for the study of Bioinformatics available on the Internet that are useful for analysing newly sequenced genomes. In this project, I perform a series of analyses on a ~5kb DNA sequence from a bacteriophage that infects marine cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus in order to identify the genes present and predict their function.

Many viruses are found in marine ecosystems and one of those is known as S-PM2, which is studied by Mann et al at the University of . "S-PM2 is a lytic cyanomyovirus virus with an icosahedral head and long contractile tail, which infects marine Synechococcus strains and has been shown to have a genome of ~194 kb." S-PM2 shares a conserved genetic module with its archetypal bacteriophage T4, which infects Escherichia coli, and this module encodes major virion proteins2. It is therefore possible that any proteins in our assessment sequence will have significant homology with bacteriophage T4. Interestingly, S-PM2 has also been shown by Mann et al to encode versions of the photosynthetic proteins D1 and D2, which make up photosystem II that are similar to those found in Synechococcus but have better resistance to photoinhibition.

In this paper, I run analyses on the assessment sequence to identify the open reading frames (potential genes) and compare the translations of these to known proteins in order to draw reasonable conclusions about their function and predict their three-dimensional structure.
The READSEQ program at the NIH was used to convert the sequence between file formats when needed.
The ORFinder program at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used to identify open reading frames in the assessment sequence using the bacterial code.
The blastp program at the NCBI was then used to translate each potential gene and compare it to all proteins in the nr database.
The MACAW program was downloaded and used to produce motif-based local multiple alignments of each translated ORF with its top blast results using the BLOSUM 62 matrix for scoring.

Each protein product was submitted to the "Compute pI/Mw tool" at ExPaSy.
The SMART suite at the EMBL was used to search for common protein domains within my translated ORFs such as transmembrane helices, coiled coils, segments of low complexity, signal peptides and GPI anchors.

Each sequence was then submitted to the Predict Protein suite, which predicted the secondary and tertiary structures of each protein. The PHD program predicted -helices,   -sheets and loops and the "GLOBE: prediction of protein globularity" results were noted.

The ORFinder located 14 ORFs (Open Reading Frames), which are potential genes (below):
Of these ORFs, five sequences conferred proteins that showed significant sequence similarity to other known proteins after the blast, as summarised in Table 1.
ORF 244 - 1074: Product Isoelectric point (pI) = 4.64, molecular weight (Mw) = 32316.10.

There is considerable identity between this translated sequence and the T4 gene product 13 (gp13), which is part of the neck of the virion:
NP_049772 gp13 neck protein [Enterobacteria phage T4].
Score = 58.5 bits (140), Expect = 1e-08.
Identities = 76/319 (23%), Positives = 122/319 (38%), Gaps = 73/319 (22%).
The MACAW alignment shown below confirms homology of this protein to the gp13 neck protein family. The sequences all show similar identity motifs for the first ~70 amino acid residues but appear to vary considerably after that. Pair scores are shaded, with scores  50% showing blue and scores  90% appearing indigo.
Fig.1The PHD results for this protein from the predict protein program (below) show five predicted -helices (highlighted red), a few short   -strands (blue) and many loop regions (green).

This sequence shows homology with the T4 gp14 neck protein - it has a score of 85.9 bits and 34% identity. This homology was confirmed by the MACAW alignment, the resulting schematic of which is below. The mean scores are shaded.
The alignment behind the MACAW schematics is shown below with the pair-score shading.
For this protein, PHD predicted three short -helices from six to nine residues and nine   -strand regions with many loops. GLOBE predicted the protein to be compact and globular with an expected 123 exposed residues.
ORF 1954 - 2754: Product pI = 4.61, Mw = 30458.57.

The blast scores for this protein are very high and the highest identity of 32% indicates that this gene codes for a protein homologous to the following T4 gene gp15, which is a tail sheath stabilizing protein.
The MACAW alignment for this protein shows many conserved motifs, of which most are present in this translated ORF. The different links generated by MACAW are shaded in this alignment with the darker shading indicating higher identity in that region.
You can see that PHD predicted three -helices and several short   -strands for this protein with many loop regions. There was a larger amount of random coiling (blanks) in this protein. GLOBE also predicted this protein to be globular.
ORF 2745 - 3170: Product pI = 4.80, Mw = 15931.94.

This ORF showed identity with the small subunits of several terminase DNA packaging enzymes, of which the highest was this gp16 from bacteriophage 44RR2.8t:
The PHD results for this translated ORF show two large -helices joined by a turn and three smaller ones, with several loops. Again GLOBE predicted the protein to be compact and globular. SMART found a coiled-coil region between amino acid residues 80 and 106 of this gene product.
ORF 3170 - 3712: Product pI = 5.50, Mw = 18412.46.

This protein was shown to have 36% identity with Transcriptional Regulatory protein rtcR from E.coli and SOS-response transcriptional repressors (RecA-mediated autopeptidases) from Rhodospirillum rubrum. PHD predicted one 11-residue -helix and seven short   -strands for this protein. GLOBE predicted that this protein "appears not as globular, as a domain".
No other ORFs returned blast results that showed significant similarity to any sequences in any of the databases. I also used the more sensitive Smith-Waterman Homology search at DISC to confirm blast results and check the smaller translated polypeptides for similar proteins.
From my analysis, I feel I can reasonably confidently conclude that the assessment DNA sequence was obtained from a T4-like bacteriophage such as S-PM2, since it appears to contain many homologous genes to those found in T4. It was previously known that S-PM2 shares a conserved genetic module with T4 that contains genes for structural proteins that make up the virion, so it is not surprising to find genes for two neck/collar proteins and a tail sheath protein in this sequence. Interestingly, genes similar to T4 's gp13 to gp16 were found in the assessment sequence in the same order. 12The structure of bacteriophage T4 is shown to the right. Gp13 and gp14 are neck proteins that protrude from the head/tail connection. Gp15 is a protein that is required to complete assembly of the T4 tail as it forms the connector, which allows it to bind to the head.

Gp16 and gp17 make up the small and large subunits respectively of the T4 enzyme terminase, which is required for DNA packaging. The assessment sequence contained an ORF that probably encodes the small subunit for a terminase enzyme in the Synechococcus-infecting bacteriophage. Horizontal gene transfer is important for evolution of marine Synechococcus and it has been shown that this process is mediated by bacteriophages. I predict that the helix-turn-helix motif predicted by PHD between residues 44 and 105 is a DNA-binding finger motif14. The predicted coiled-coil in this region would also be evidence for this. The gene for the large subunit, gp17, which contains 610 amino acid residues, is not present in the assessment sequence.

The ORF between nucleotides 3170 and 3712 is likely to code for a transcriptional regulatory protein because of its homology with those from E.coli and R.rubrum and because it was not predicted to be globular. It is not possible to tell, however, which genes it regulates from sequence data alone.
