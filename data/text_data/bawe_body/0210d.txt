The most viable strategy for a new entrant would be to differentiate his/her product. This is because the market the entrant looking at is a complex monopoly and gaining market share is difficult since the market is very established. The new entrant would have difficulties gaining market share through low price since the very big companies that already exist which acts as a oligopoly have a low profit margin and a good market share; therefore they could easily start a price war where the new entrant can not exist.
By differentiating the product the new entrant could concentrate on a more specific small market and since there is no oligopoly the new entrant can enter the market and gain market share easily.
The entrepreneur should acquire the company since it already has a good market share and advertising for a new brand name would not be necessary. The firm has improved during the last few years and will show a positive growth in the future. Since the market the firm acts in is an oligopoly, it would be difficult to enter the market as a new company to compete with the current firm and starting a price war with the current firm is not possible because the current firm has a good market share and low profit margin.
