There are variety ways to determine protein and DNA properties for biological samples with modern techniques. This laboratory used absorbance and BCA method to determine concentration of protein solution, circular dichrosim (CD) for protein secondary structure determination, and fluorescence spectroscopy to find the DNA and ligand equilibrium binding constant.
The principle behind the absorbance method is based on the relation where A is the absorbance of the sample solution, Io is the intensity coming in, I the intensity coming out,    the extinction coefficient, c the concentration, and l the path length.
BCA method is based on the principle of linear relation between the absorbance and the protein solution. The unknown protein concentration is determined by comparing the absorbance value with the standard solution.
If the structure is not symmetric, CD spectroscopy can measure the differences in the absorbance of left-handed polarized light versus the right-hand polarized light. CD spectroscopy can be applied to determine protein secondary structure in far-UV region (190-260nm).   -helix,   -sheet and random coil structure can give a characteristic shape of CD spectrum.
Fluorescence occurs when a molecule absorbs a high-energy photon, and re-emits it as a lower-energy photon with a longer wavelength. Fluorescence is more sensitive than absorbance, and it is sensitive to environment, too. Fluorescence signal is proportional to concentration of a particular fluorophore in a given environment, so it can be used to determine Lf+Sf=Lb equilibrium binding constant by the formula.
Where Lf represent ligand free, Sf site free, and Lb ligand bind.
A DNA solution sample with approximate concentration 1400  M is made up from mixing 2.310mg calf thymus DNA, weighted by a 4-figure balance, and 4mL water measured by a 1000  L pipette.
The protein sample (unknown protein, referred as U) used here is myoglobin, and the protein stock (US) is made up to be around 1mg/mL. A total volume of 3.5mL protein is prepared with 3.5mg myoglobin weighted by the balance hydrating into 3.5mL distilled water.
A 2mL sample was made up with 1mL US and 1mL water in quartz cuvette. The absorbance is measured from 200-700nm and data are stored in a floppy disk.
Total 8 samples are prepared to determine US concentration by measuring four absorbance at 562nm of the standard solution (BSA, bovine serum albumin) corresponding to four different concentration. The standard solution BSA is 2.00mg/mL, US approximate concentration should be 1mg/mL, and the values of US concentration to be determined are chosen as 300  g/mL and 200  g/mL. The 8 samples are prepared by mixing up the following chemicals listed in the table below:
All those samples are incubated in 37  C for 30 minutes. After the tubes cooled down to room temperature, the samples are transferred to the cuvettes and the absorbance are measured for each sample. 0.1mg/mL solution of US is put into a 1mm quarz cuvette and CD spectrum is collected from 260-190nm. After the measurement, the cuvette is washed with water for 3 times and acetone 3 times, and dried with a nitrogen line.
First of all, a 2mL 100  M DNA solution is obtained by adding 140  L stock solution (approx. 1400  M) into 1860  L distilled water. Secondly, the absorbance at 260 is measured for this DNA solution from 320-200nm. By applying Beer Lambert Law, the original DNA sample concentration turned out to be 2140  M/L. The concentration of Ru is calculated to be 166.8  M according to the values given at A 445=0.2835 and   Ru,445=17,000cm -1mol -1dm3, l=1mm. Seven samples for fluorescence spectra is prepared from the original DNA sample and Ru sample provided, containing different concentration of DNA and Ru , listed in the following table:
Then, fluorescence spectra are measured for six samples, with the first water sample zeroing the scale. The data are stored in the floppy disk.
From the absorbance value measured from 200-700nm, we found A 280=0.8728. (see figure 1.) A 1cm cuvette is used in the measurement thus the path length l=1cm. The coefficient of extinction of myoglobin at 280nm   =11000M -1cm -1 is obtained from online database (, by choosing description as myoglobin, primary accession number P14393, entry name GLB_APLJU). Also, the molecular weight of this myoglobin turned out to be 15015.8 g/mol. (see appendix I).
Then, according to Beer Lambert Law, the molar or mass concentration of the US is or.
Figure 2. shows the values of BSA concentration and the corresponding absorbance (denoted by *), the two different absorbance corresponding to different concentration with repeated observation for the US are also indicated in the graph (shown in two dash line for each concentration). The straight line is obtained from the data set in the sense of least square. A hand drawing plot is also provided as attachment of this report.
From the value obtained from the graph, we can see the absorbance for the US concentration at approximately 300  g/mL is measured as 0.289 and 0.318, which correspond to concentration values as 262.7 and 289.1. Similarly, for 200  g/mL, the corresponding value is 182.7 and 193.6. By taking the mean value, the concentration found in the graph is 276  g/mL and 188  g/mL, which correspond to original US concentration to be 0.92 mg/mL and 0.94mg/mL, respectively.
By subtracting the baseline provided from the CD spectrum, we get the following diagram (figure 3.):
With no available CDsstr software for protein structure determination, I use DICHROWEB as the tool to do the myoglobin protein secondary structure analysis. By setting mean residue weight as 105, protein concentration as 0.1mg/mL, and path length as 0.1cm, we get the percent of   -helices is 4.715 with average length 10.505nm, and strand 2.624% with average length 4.167nm. (see appendix II).
Figure 4 shows the relationship experimental data with expected data. At the wavelength 222, 208, we can see clearly negative peaks occurred, which means the existence of   -helices.
The fluorescence spectra are presented as below ( figure 5). The first peaks of each curve should be ignored since this is the light from the lamp of the fluorescence machine. The second peaks are studies. Those peaks represent the intensity of fluorescence light the molecule made. By taking the value of fluorescence intensity at wavelength 580nm, and use the mean value of 10 data points around this wavelength, we obtain seven fluorescence intensities values as -0.0267, 409.7130, 461.4506, 496.7539, 554.4751, 573.3974, and 740.6843, respectively. Plot these fluorescent intensity versus DNA concentration (0 10 20 40 80 300) ( see figure 6). The first fluorescence intensity value (the blue curve at the bottom of figure 5) is neglected since it is only a zero scale for the other fluorescence.
According to the lecture notes, we can construct a table to calculate the value of L b, L f, r and r/L f, where L f stands for the concentration of ligand Ru free and L b for bind. Here, we use the fluorescence intensity at [DNA]=300  M as F b, and fluorescence intensity at [DNA]=0  M as F f.
Since the first and last rows do not contain useful information, we just simply neglect it. However, maybe due to some problem, the second last row data did not follow the trend of the previous values, and I have to neglect it in order to obtain the Scatchard plots (figure 7), with the binding constant K=-0.022.
Ideally, 1mg/mL protein solution should have absorbance of 1. However, I got the absorbance at 280nm as 0.8728, which is slightly lower than 1, and the calculated protein concentration as 1.19mg/mL, which is a bit higher than 1mg/mL. The difference may due to the protein sample, the measurement error, and the environment situation. The assumption underlying this method is based on the following condition: no contribution from light scattering, no other chromphore in the protein, and no other absorbing contaminant, etc.
If we use another way to calculate the concentration of protein,.
We get a slightly lower protein concentration than the ideal one 1mg/mL, and the value calculated from the absorbance at 280 directly. The above formula is used in the case when the protein solution is not so pure, containing a significant amounts of nuclei acid ( as a few percent). In this case, we should also determine the absorbance at 260 nm to correct the presence of nuclei acids.
Exercise answer:
If we know that the molecular weight of lysozyme is 14314, n W=6, n Y=3, n C=8,   280(C)=300 cm -1dm 3mol -1,   280(W)=5700 cm -1dm 3mol -1, and   280(Y)=1300 cm -1dm 3mol -1, we can determine the extinction coefficient    for lysozyme by:   280=n W*  280(W)+n Y*  280(Y)+n C*  280 (C)= 6*5700+3*1300+8*300=40500 which is not so far away from the experimental value of   280 = 37932 cm -1dm 3mol -1.
Similar for chymotrysinogen, according to the value of its molecular weight 25670, n W=8, n Y=4, n C=10, and the calculated extinction coefficient turns out to be 53800 cm -1dm 3mol -1, compared with the experimental value 51340 cm -1dm 3mol -1.
For near UV (240-290nm), absorbance can be used to determine aromatic side chains, which present especially in Tyrosine, Tryptophan, Phenyl alanine, and Cystine. Proteins that contain aromatic side chains can use the above formula to determine the extinction coefficient, such as lysozyme and chymotrysinogen.
The absorbance and the protein concentration should be linear relation in an ideal case. However, due to measurement error and environmental influencing factors, the observed absorbance did not fall exactly on a line, which requires using regression to connect each data set in the least square error sense.
By comparing the absorbance method and BCA method, the results obtained by both methods are consistent with 1mg/mL. However, the concentration determined by absorbance is a bit larger while the value from BCA is slightly smaller.
CD signal reflects an average of the entire molecular population. So, CD can only determine the percentage of the   -helix of a protein but not the specific residues involved in the   -helix portion.
With the help of the online website ( ), I can find the myoglobin protein structure with the PDB code 2FAL. However, no percentage of   -helices is given in the website, thus no comparison can be made.
The Scatchard plots did not work so well in this case, due to the data value obtained from the fluorescence machine at DNA concentration 40  M and 80   M with no significant difference. This problem caused here is probably due to the unpurified DNA sample or manipulate error. I have tried twice for this measurement, and the data used here is the value of the second time since the first time those two curves looks identical.
In this laboratory, we determined the protein concentration with two methods - absorbance and BCA method, with consistent but slightly different results. CD spectroscopy can determine the protein secondary structure by telling the percent of   -helices, as approximate 4.7%. Fluorescence spectra is measured to determine the binding constant for DNA and Ru at different concentration.
