24_DAN,"I only have uh, that many cards, so."
24_JENN,How many cards you have. You only have two.
24_DAN,Just two.
24_JENN,So you can't have a set.
24_DAN,When do you get... h-... when do you get cards though. I don't understand that.
24_JENN,Every time you take over a country you get cards...
24_DAN,Uh what row.
24_JENN,"Attack with the twenty-two. Press twenty-two, attack."

24_JENN,Oh man. Look at that. Okay. Are we not attacking each other until we get rid of the striped guy.
24_DAN,I don't know. It's up to you. You make the call.
24_JENN,I'm not gonna be able to wipe this striped guy out yet. I don't think.
24_DAN,I'm. I'm not gonna be able to either.
24_JENN,"Oh man, look at that. Totally wipe me out. See if I wipe him out, you're just gonna wipe me out. Which is kinda stupid."
24_DAN,You can't reach that.
24_JENN,Oh.
24_DAN,You gotta go through Iceland. There you go.
24_JENN,I wonder if I can do it.
24_DAN,"Twenty-o-... no, you're... you're not gonna be able to get through twenty-one and eighteen. You can get... you c-... you might be able to get the single one there, but I'd fortify down there, because he's just gonna attack you again. What a-. Look at me. Telling you what to do."
24_JENN,"Yeah, look at you."
24_DAN,"I'd. I'd put all your guys, like right around there though..."

24_DAN,", Oh, let's see."
24_JENN,"Oh, you suck... Oh my God..."
24_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,You suck. I'm gonna waste you...
24_DAN,Is that you right there.
24_JENN,Yes. Twenty-eight. Friend.
24_DAN,What the hell is that.
24_JENN,I don't know...
24_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"That sounds like it was right in front of my house, doesn't it."
24_DAN,"Yeah, it does..."
24_MAC,<NONVERBAL>
24_DAN,Uh-oh. What happened.
24_JENN,"I don't know. Oh you don't, What does that mean..."
24_MAC,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"I don't know what that mean-. Oh, you can't do it, after your turn is over."
24_DAN,Oh.
24_JENN,After you've already fortified.

24_MAC,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"Shit shit shit. Shit... Oh I shouldn't have done that. That was dumb. That was dumb, fuck. Oh no..."
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_MAC,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Oh no...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Oh my god.

24_DAN,<XX>.
24_JENN,Has to happen.
24_DAN,Oh. No way...
24_JENN,I wanna just look at my cards here...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"Please, Oh <XX>, but I got a new one..."
24_MAC,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"Got a new one, alright... Now, if I can just get to the next..."
24_DAN,Thank you very much.
24_JENN,For what.
24_DAN,I just took over Iceland.
24_JENN,"Oh, fuck. Right while I was kissing you, you traitor. Oh my God, oh my God... Oh. Oh no..."
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Oh. I'm f- so hurt.
24_DAN,Uh.
24_JENN,I can't believe you just won. I was gonna win the next hand...
24_DAN,Quit.
24_JENN,You suck. Yeah...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"Hmm, You're so happy with yourself..."
24_DAN,No. I'm just happy that I beat you.
24_JENN,"Oh, yeah..."
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Yeah.
24_DAN,The Big Stuff. Hunh.
24_JENN,Yeah the Big Stuff's all my Stanford stuff.
24_DAN,Oh. Now what. Backgammon. What's Hearts.
24_JENN,Hearts. It's the card game.
24_DAN,Oh yeah. Put it up there.
24_JENN,Wanna play hearts.
24_DAN,"Let's check that one out... y neat... wait, play novice. I've never played hearts before."
24_JENN,You've never played Hearts.
24_DAN,"In my life. No, I don't know how to play it."
24_JENN,Oh. Okay. I'll teach you.
24_DAN,Passing disabled. That's you.
24_JENN,Queen of sp-...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Uh First lead rotates...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"First, yeah..."
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Always pass left...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,Alright. So this is us.
24_DAN,"Groucho, Harpo."
24_JENN,"Uh The object, okay, every heart, okay, every heart is one point."
24_DAN,Is tr-.
24_JENN,"The q- queen of spades is thirteen points, the object is not to have any points. And, you play following suit, and, you can take, if you take tricks, th- the highest card of the suit, takes the trick. If you don't have the card of the suit, you throw whatever you want..."
24_DAN,"Okay. So h- hearts, and the queen of spades."
24_JENN,Are bad.
24_DAN,Are the only thing.
24_JENN,That are.
24_DAN,That... that have points.
24_JENN,That are points. Right. So if you-.
24_DAN,So.
24_JENN,"If you throw... uh, Look okay."
24_DAN,Y-...
24_JENN,<NONVERBAL>
24_DAN,"So we got like three points, right here. Right."
24_JENN,"We have three points in our hand, exactly."
24_DAN,And we w- wanna try to get rid of that.
24_JENN,"N Right, but we're passing. Now the first thing you do is you pass three cards to your left. Now these are low hearts. So I can. I'm not gonna pass those. I'm gonna pass, the f- four of clubs."
24_DAN,All the... y- right-. Why is that.
24_JENN,"And these are two high... why... just because. And... cause you should always pass a club, so that the person... so that the first hand, y- everyone has a club, so that they can't discard a heart. Cause you always assume that everyone's t-... no one is void, of a suit. The first time around, so you don't have to worry about throwing a high card."
24_DAN,Yeah. Yeah.
24_JENN,"And then I'm gonna throw two high cards, so I don't take those tricks. Because."
24_DAN,But what difference does it make if you take a trick.
24_JENN,Well because i-.
24_DAN,They're not worth anything.
24_JENN,"Cause if I t-. If I take a tr-... the k- diamond trick, and somebody didn't have diamonds, and they threw a heart into that pile, I was gonna take that, with that ace. So if I throw an ace of diamonds, and somebody doesn't have any diamonds, they're gonna throw a heart on me, and I'm gonna have to take that trick..."
24_DAN,"Okay, but, but if they play hearts, that doesn't... that doesn't win anything. I-."
24_JENN,If they play h-.
24_DAN,N okay. Just go ahead and play.
24_JENN,Okay. Alright. So I'm passing three s three cards. And I got...
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,"The seven of hearts, three of hearts, and the king of f- spades. Begin play. The two of clubs always leads, uh I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs, assuming I'm gonna take this trick."
24_DAN,Okay-. Okay.
24_JENN,No one have to.
24_DAN,And then-... and everybody.
24_JENN,Right...
24_DAN,"So it's kinda risky playing the king, since."
24_JENN,But I'm gonna assume everyone has clubs still.
24_DAN,Okay. Alright... <XX>.
24_JENN,"Okay, cause there are thirteen cards, I'm assuming it's an equal deal. Now there are eight clubs out, that means there are only four more left."
24_DAN,So you don't... y-... so you wanna play.
24_JENN,So I'm gonna-.
24_DAN,A high d-... high diamond.
24_JENN,"Yeah, exactly. Like a high diamond. So jack of diamonds. Okay, taken with."
24_DAN,"Okay, so he took that."
24_JENN,Okay. Now the spade.
24_DAN,So now.
24_JENN,"Now this is a tricky one, now, If I have a high spade now, I'd throw it, because I could take this trick, and the h- my highest spade would be out. Now I don't ever wanna take the queen of spades, high spades are dangerous because you might... queen of spades is a hard cr- card to get rid of."
24_DAN,"So if, yeah okay, I see."
24_JENN,Now I don't have-... oh I do have a spade.
24_DAN,"Well you're in a good position now, because you've seen what everybody else has played."
24_JENN,Right. That's why. Diamond.
24_DAN,So you have to play a diamond.
24_JENN,Now h-.
24_DAN,Right.
24_JENN,"Right, and there have been no diamond-. Has there been a diamond trick. There's been one diamond trick."
24_DAN,"Uh, y-... yeah."
24_JENN,W- only one though.
24_DAN,Yeah.
24_JENN,Right.
24_DAN,Yeah.
24_JENN,Okay.
24_DAN,"Yeah, you played your ace."
24_JENN,"Okay now it was led, the spade was led, but there's a heart in this trick. So I wanna get under the seven. Because I don't wanna take this trick. Because there's a heart."
24_DAN,Okay.
24_JENN,"But that's easy, cause I only have two spades..."
24_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
24_JENN,And they're both under seven.
24_DAN,Uh so you would have taken that.
24_JENN,If I had a eight.
24_DAN,"So now, you can still get under that..."
24_JENN,"I could still get under so, Alright."
24_DAN,Too. He's got an eight. So you-.
24_JENN,"Now listen, Okay now, b- two different people took hearts. Now, if you t- have all... if you take all the points, if you take all the points. All thirteen hearts, and the queen of diamonds."
24_DAN,So that's twenty-six points.
24_JENN,"It's called, right. It's called shooting the moon, and you get... you give everyone else twenty-six points, or else you're minus twenty-six points. And that's good. Shooting the moon is really hard to do. Now look it, I don't have a club."
24_DAN,So you can throw a heart.
24_JENN,There you go.
24_DAN,A high heart. Okay.
24_JENN,"I don't have a club. Now, somebody else did take hearts. Right. Or did he... or am I mistaken. I thought ev- someone else did take hearts, I think somebody else did take hearts..."
24_DAN,Queen of spades gonna have to come up m-... n-.
24_JENN,There.
24_DAN,There it is.
24_JENN,"He led, did he just shoot the moon. I thought someone else took. No. Ch-. Yeah. So he got. Groucho got one heart."
24_DAN,One.
24_JENN,And Chico got twenty-five.
24_DAN,So he's b- kinda bumming right now.
24_JENN,So he sucks... right.
24_DAN,Okay. So pass three cards. So we wanna pass.
24_JENN,"Uh, Alright. Pass, so we're gonna pass, the king of spades."
24_DAN,King of puppy-dogs' feet. How come you don't pass the king of clubs.
24_JENN,"I might. I don't have any aces here. I'm gonna pass a low heart. Just so they can't shoot the moon. I got the ace of hearts, Okay. Two of clubs. King of clubs. Ace is out. So my queen is the highest there. Alright, my jack is the highest there."
24_DAN,So you wanna play that now. Oh.
24_JENN,Well I'll do it.
24_DAN,So you took that one.
24_JENN,Yeah.
24_DAN,But that doesn't make any difference uh.
24_JENN,"Right. Now the two. See, alright. Now. Diamonds are a- wasted. Alright."
24_DAN,Did you just take that.
24_JENN,No.
24_DAN,That heart. No.
24_JENN,No. Groucho has the uh.
24_DAN,Spades were led.
24_JENN,The f.
24_DAN,So you play.
24_JENN,"Spade was led, The ace."
24_DAN,"Take-. Can you play a club, if spades were led, and you didn't have."
24_JENN,"I can. Yeah, I can."
24_DAN,"But, but if you had hearts."
24_JENN,Yeah.
24_DAN,So you can play anything then.
24_JENN,I can lead. I can pl-... th- I can play anything.
24_DAN,So why don't you just get rid of high clubs.
24_JENN,"Right. I'm thinking I'm gonna know... who's. G- Harpo's gonna take this, so the points are split now. So I don't have to worry. Now the queen is the highest, so, uh Two l-... the two of hearts is a great lead. You can't lead hearts, unless hearts have already been dropped, also."
24_DAN,Yeah.
24_JENN,"Oh shit. Oh fuck. I took a point there. I'm gonna take all the rest, I think. Um."
24_DAN,How can you.
24_JENN,"Maybe not. Oh man. I knew it. I'm gonna take all the rest. Fuck. I just got like seven points... shit. Eight... <XX>, Alright, I have no spades. This is a really good hand. I have no spades whatsoever. It's really good."
24_DAN,Play hearts...
24_JENN,<NONVERBAL>
