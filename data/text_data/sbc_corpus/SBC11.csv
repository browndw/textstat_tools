11_DORI,Yes she has.
11_ANGE,You know.
11_DORI,She has.
11_ANGE,"Uh, she used to go over and read a book."
11_DORI,Uh Yeah or.
11_ANGE,Or something.
11_DORI,B- turn a deaf ear. That was for sure...
11_ANGE,"But uh, once you understand it, you know you..."
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,"You're interested in getting right in, and going after it."
11_DORI,"Yeah. I really oughta call, at least Reg Barr, and ask if uh, he's still speaking to me."
11_ANGE,Well now he was the one that was up on the uh left.
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_ANGE,Up there.
11_DORI,Yeah. Yes.
11_ANGE,"Well he came over to you all smiles, I noticed."
11_DORI,"N yes. Well, we've known each other for thirty some years, why wouldn't he. But a- anyway, um, I was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit... because it was Burns that's been ob jecting to our having it."
11_ANGE,Oh.
11_DORI,"And I knew this. So when he opened up on that, and she followed through, and told about her husband, you know..."
11_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"Not necessarily that she would approve of it, but at least she wasn't disapproving."
11_ANGE,Yeah.
11_DORI,Of it.
11_ANGE,Yeah.
11_DORI,"And uh, course Duvall might-... uh And I-. I cannot get over this. That man. I really cannot. And you know, he must have been thinking, when he said he wasn't a political appointee, he must have been associating his relationship with Steitler..."
11_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,Oh...
11_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,I really do believe that.
11_ANGE,Mhm.
11_DORI,In his thinking. I don't know how else he could have done it. That topples over...
11_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,Um...
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,But he didn't say that.
11_ANGE,Oh.
11_DORI,"He said I loved your uh hum- humor, uh, and I love you, but, I am not a political appointee. And his eyes were just snapping..."
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,And I said oh...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,How did you get on the board...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"Well he said, I got a letter from the governor asking..."
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,Everybody on there is an app- political appointee...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,That wasn't the point...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"The point was, I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him, that he was related, uh you know, had business with Steitler, And I just said, and there's Doctor Duvall, you know..."
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"And then I went to Rotus, who's a seasoned politician."
11_ANGE,Yeah.
11_DORI,"If there ever was one, he just would flare. And I said, well I-. Alright. I said, I'll apologize next time... uh And I'm gonna make hay out of it. Don't you worry..."
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"I wanna know how you birds got on that board, if you're not political appointees..."
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,Mm.
11_DORI,Oh my.

11_ANGE,Well I think it was Barbara that has some seeds.
11_SAM,Just-. No problem. It comes right up.
11_ANGE,Yeah. Yeah.

11_SAM,I-.
11_DORI,You gave him some kind of herb.
11_SAM,Did I give him some. I gave him a red pepper.
11_DORI,I think you-. I think you gave him some herb of some kind.
11_SAM,"I may have given- given him some basil, yes."
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_SAM,"I don't have any this year, I forgot to plant it, I have oregano."

11_SAM,<XX>.
11_DORI,"Is your cigarette out, everybody's."
11_ANGE,"Yeah, it's out."
11_DORI,"You smoked it down into the cork, didn't you."
11_ANGE,Pardon.
11_DORI,You smoked it down into the cork.
11_ANGE,"Well, yeah, you don't like that..."
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>

11_DORI,Oh...

11_ANGE,No good. Uh...
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>

11_SAM,"He's uh keeping very busy, he's on mostly uh evening hours."
11_ANGE,Mhm.
11_SAM,They're redoing the pharmacy there at Wel- Wallmart.
11_ANGE,Oh.
11_SAM,Enlarging it. And.
11_ANGE,Well.
11_SAM,"It's close to the garden shop, and so the fellows in the garden shop, and the pet shop, have to move things out from that area."
11_ANGE,Oh.
11_SAM,"Into the garden shop, so they can work on the pharmacy."
11_ANGE,"Well they needed to expand the pharmacy, I've never been there, but, what I had to wait and wait and wait."
11_SAM,So I don't-.
11_DORI,Where are they putting the pharmacy.
11_SAM,"Well they're b- leaving it in the same place, they're just taking out two rows of, of uh."
11_ANGE,S-.
11_SAM,Where the toiletries were.
11_ANGE,Yeah. Just inventory stuff. Moving it.
11_SAM,"Uh uh They're... they're moving that. I don't know where, where they're going to put all that."
11_ANGE,Hm...
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_SAM,But Ted says there's not much garden left...
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_SAM,"Just, all of this stuff, out in there, he works uh six days next week, instead of five days..."
11_ANGE,<XX>.
11_SAM,He only gets one day off.
11_ANGE,Hm. Mhm.
11_SAM,He's off today.
11_ANGE,Mhm.
11_SAM,And uh.
11_ANGE,Well.
11_SAM,"But he hasn't had day hours, he's been working evening hours and weekends."
11_ANGE,"You know, I think I'd hate to be in business right now."
11_DORI,Oo.
11_ANGE,You can't sit still.
11_DORI,Hm-m.
11_ANGE,"You have to expand, or something..."
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,To keep in the main stream.
11_SAM,"Well, and so many times when they expand, they've expanded, and then things dropped back."
11_ANGE,Yeah.
11_SAM,"But this Wallmart needs, uh needs a larger building."
11_ANGE,Yeah.
11_SAM,It's just too cramped.
11_DORI,Your shirt and beads are most becoming.
11_ANGE,"Well you know, I think they weigh about a quarter of an ounce. And that's the right kind of beads."
11_DORI,Unhunh... for summer.
11_ANGE,"A little girl the other day, remarked about them, and, almost on impulse, but I didn't do it. I thought I'd pull em off, just give em to her if she liked em that well..."
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,"You know. But then I thought, these are the only summer beads I have."
11_DORI,Right. And I like. I like that b- shirt.
11_ANGE,You know what I had to do. This.
11_DORI,What did you.
11_ANGE,This. See where I sewed right down the middle of that.
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_ANGE,"Otherwise it would balloon out. And so I s-, put it on the machine, and sewed right down through the middle of it..."
11_SAM,So it doesn't gap...
11_ANGE,So it d- doesn't gap-. Right.
11_DORI,"Oh, smart."
11_ANGE,Yeah. Well it works...
11_DORI,Smart.
11_ANGE,"It had a, it had a, one of those bottoms that."
11_DORI,Oh.
11_ANGE,Are... what do you call it.
11_SAM,A tail.
11_DORI,No. The tight. It- uh uh the band.
11_SAM,Oh.
11_ANGE,The t- the tight band around the bottom of it.
11_DORI,B- band.
11_SAM,I don't like those.
11_ANGE,I don't either.
11_DORI,Makes your butt look thin.
11_ANGE,Most all of em are that way.
11_DORI,Makes your hei-.
11_ANGE,And do you know.
11_DORI,Makes your heinie look thinner.
11_ANGE,"I went over to a store, where it says..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,"Uh sewing, alterations. And all that stuff. And I said, how much do you charge, for taking that bottom band off the top, you know. And just making it a straight shirt. And she said, eight dollars. And I thought, oh my lord, I didn't pay that much for the top I've got on..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"You know, that's a little like these catalog things. I saw something in a cat-... the catalog, this USPE deal that-, I've been with for a long time, and, I wanted to buy it, It was a m-, m- like a muumuu."
11_ANGE,Mhm.
11_DORI,"Weren't those pretty ones up, in Dillards the other day, those muumuus, did you notice em. Didn't you notice em, as you went out, all beautiful colors. So pretty. Well anyway, they were on the rack. And uh, I wanted to order that muumuu, I mean it was around twenty-nine dollars, or something like that, and two pairs of short pajamas. One for Sam, and one for me. And, I looked at the postage attached to it..."
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"And I thought good heavens. It would have been around eight dollar-. It's by amounts of money. Not weight. It's by money. How much money this costs. And it's geared according to that. And I thought, uh forget it. I could take that eight dollars, and buy another whole outfit."
11_ANGE,"Yeah, you know, this is amazing. Uh, I like to get um pillow covers. That you zip on, to protect the pillows."
11_DORI,Mhm. Mhm.
11_ANGE,"And uh, I went over to Sears, one time, and ordered three. Through the catalog. And instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,I paid postage on it separate.
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_ANGE,And do you know the postage came to more.
11_DORI,Than the g-... than the product.
11_ANGE,More than the product.
11_DORI,Right. Right...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,Well I. I w-... uh That's one of the letters that I'm going to write to USPE. And just tell them...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"That they're gearing this in the wrong way. It should be geared according to weight. Now. That g- cotton... two pairs of cotton pajamas, and that cotton muumuu, ain't gonna weigh up to eight dollars worth, Believe you me."
11_ANGE,"I wouldn't think, No."
11_DORI,"I know better. So, I thought th-, I just won't order from em. I m-. That's foolish."
11_SAM,"We better go up to Dillards, and see if they still have those muumuus."
11_DORI,You mean up to Phoenix.
11_SAM,"No, well- they might have them here, in town."
11_DORI,I don't know.
11_SAM,At Dillards.
11_DORI,They... they were sure pretty. Pretty c-... pretty colors. Some of em were dark.
11_X,Yeah. Yeah.
11_DORI,"But they had, oh, purples and, uh reds and, pinks and, oh, pretty designs in em."
11_ANGE,Hm...
11_DORI,You didn't see em.
11_ANGE,I don't think I was-. I was. I think I was concerned about your getting there and back...
11_DORI,Oh.
11_SAM,"Oh, hunh..."
11_DORI,You're not the only one baby...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,You weren't the only one...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"Sam, I was just dripping. I was just soaked."
11_SAM,Buckets.
11_DORI,I was just absolutely soaked. Wasn't I.
11_ANGE,"Yeah. She c- came in, and sat down in the restaurant..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,"You know and spent, the first ten or fifteen minutes."
11_DORI,Uh...
11_ANGE,stopping the flow of... trickling down her neck...
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_SAM,Oh...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,Oh terrible. Just terrible.
11_ANGE,Oh well...
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,I. My other Doris does the same thing.
11_SAM,Oh does she...
11_ANGE,<XX>. Yeah.
11_DORI,Well what is it.
11_ANGE,I don't know. She doesn't know.
11_SAM,Well some people just perspire.
11_DORI,Well I didn't persp- use to perspire like that.
11_SAM,More.
11_DORI,But I sure have done it.
11_SAM,"No, not to that extent you didn't."
11_DORI,"Recently... uh Th- that, and the time we were up in uh, M- Montgomery Wards. Remember."
11_SAM,Oh yes.
11_DORI,Oh boy was I soaked.
11_SAM,That was just.
11_DORI,And that was in the winter.
11_SAM,Weakness. Exertion.
11_DORI,Well maybe that's what this was. But anyway.
11_ANGE,I wish the stores would open earlier.
11_DORI,Earlier. Yes. I do too.
11_SAM,"Instead of ten o'clock, in the summertime they oughta open at least at nine..."
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,Well it would he-.
11_DORI,I'd say eight.
11_ANGE,Uh it would help. Eight o'clock would be fine.
11_SAM,You hate to start out at ten o'clock.
11_DORI,"I'd say eight, and quit at four..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,You know the little folks who live above me.
11_DORI,Mhm.
11_ANGE,"Go over to Tucson Mall, and walk every morning..."
11_DORI,Yeah. That's good.
11_ANGE,And there's a side door.
11_DORI,Mhm.
11_ANGE,"Unlocked. So that they can go in, oh I think."
11_DORI,A lotta people do that.
11_ANGE,They go r- uh- at least by eight o'clock...
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_ANGE,And they go in.
11_DORI,They go in and walk.
11_ANGE,"And then they know <XX>, so many times around, you know."
11_DORI,Mhm. Mhm.
11_ANGE,"Will um, make a mile. And then there's a, soft drink place up there that they all congregate."
11_SAM,Oh...
11_ANGE,And uh.
11_DORI,Why don't you join em.
11_ANGE,"And they have pins, when they cover fifty miles, or whatever you know."
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_ANGE,And a hundred miles of.
11_SAM,What outfit is this from. Oasis.
11_ANGE,No.
11_DORI,No.
11_ANGE,It's a-.
11_DORI,It's just a neighborhood thing. It's just people around in that area.
11_ANGE,It's ne-.
11_DORI,And they go there to walk...
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"I think. I think that's it. But uh, I-... uh... we've been over there, and we've seen em go in, and all they're doing is just walking."
11_ANGE,"Mhm. They might be good people, we could cultivate to hunt things for us..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,Yeah.
11_SAM,You mean look in the window.
11_DORI,Now that's... that's an idea...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,Instead of having to parade all around looking for it...
11_ANGE,<NONVERBAL>
11_DORI,"They're around, why not tell us where that is."
11_ANGE,"Well yeah, well they can explain..."
11_DORI,<NONVERBAL>

11_ANGE,And you shake it on.
11_SAM,Yeah.
11_ANGE,"And I've... uh Other day, somebody was eating lunch at my house..."
11_SAM,<NONVERBAL>
