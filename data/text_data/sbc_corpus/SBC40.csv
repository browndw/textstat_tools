40_DEBR,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park, and to the Hall of Champions presentation. We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon, and as we bring them out, we'll give you the history on each one, and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want, and to ask questions... Our first horse here today at the Hall of Champions, is our only thoroughbred stallion. This is Bold Forbes. Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion, and he was foaled in nineteen seventy-three. He is by the stallion Irish Castle, and out of the unraced mare Comely Nell. He was bred by Lee Eaton, and Red Bull Stables. This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy-four. Mister Estaban Tizol, a banker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico, liked Bold Forbes' pedigree. And he liked this horse so much, that he decided he was going to buy him, no matter what the cost. The cost ended up being fifteen-thousand two-hundred dollars, and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico. In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old, he went off at odds of thirty-five to one, and he won that race by seventeen lengths. He was entered into four more races, he won them all, and in doing so, he was named champion two-year-old in Puerto Rico. Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico, so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition. So in the summer of nineteen seventy-five, he was shipped to New York, to his new trainer Laz Barrera. In New York he won the Freemont Stakes, and the Saratoga Special, before he injured his shins, and was given the rest of the year off. Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints, or six furlong races. The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race, at a mile and a quarter. So as a three-year-old, Forbes wasn't given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby. But his trainer had more confidence in him than that, and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle, Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby, at odds of seventeen to one, one length in front of the leader, Honest Pleasure. The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes. He cut his left hind heel during the race, but he still managed to run third. But when the Belmont rolled around, he had that all healed up, and he won the Belmont stakes by a neck. In October, Forbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap, and again he severely bruised his right hind foot. Again he ran a very game third, but after this race, he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury. So he was retired to stud from the track. Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share, and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm. As a stallion, Bold Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass, a winner of over half a million dollars, Bold Apparel, a champion filly in Italy, Air Forbes One, and over two-hundred other winners. Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars, in just two years on the racetrack. He was in eighteen races, and had thirteen wins, and was never worse than third. He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety-one. He is twenty-one years old, and stands fifteen point three hands tall. Ladies and gentlemen, the nineteen seventy-six Kentucky Derby winner, Bold Forbes..."

40_DEBR,"Does anyone have any questions, while we're waiting for the next horse to come out. Questions. Okay, while we're waiting, I'll just call everyone's attention to this horse, I don't know if everyone can see him, over here in this paddock on the right, this is Sergeant Pepper Feature, and, he's usually in our show, but, because Bold Forbes is up here today, he. We kicked him out. We have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions, and only five stalls. So we could only have five at a time in the show. Um, Sergeant Pepper was the nineteen eighty-two world champion racing quarter horse, and, at the time of his retirement, he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history, and he had earnings of over nine-hundred thousand dollars. So, on your way out today, you might wanna just take a look over there, and say hi to Sergeant Pepper... And there's Bold Forbes looking out the window. If anybody can see him, he's right there, watching the show... Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions, that is not a racehorse. This is Imperator. And he is a five-gaited American Saddlebred showhorse. Perry, as he is commonly called, is by the sire Supreme Sultan, who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park. He is out of the dam Empress Wing, and she is by the great sire Wing Commander. Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator. Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois, and he was purchased there as a two-year-old, by his owner, Doctor Geraldine Meanor, and then sent to his trainer, Don Harris, of Simpsonville Kentucky. Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared. They both had the same birthday. And as the years went past, and Imperator's popularity increased, Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did. Being five-gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits, the walk trot and canter, plus two manmade gaits, the slow gait and the rack. The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed. Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five-gaited world grand championship four times. And he has also been reserve world champion five times. He was shown eighty-five times, at forty-four shows around the country. He has sixty-eight blue ribbons, thirteen seconds, and very rarely was he ever worse than third. Now the first time Perry was shown, he was very wild and inexperienced, and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring. And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions. But the second time he was shown, he had improved so much, the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back, with all four feet stuck up in the air. Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail. At the highlight of his career, Perry's tail was fourteen feet long, and could be wrapped completely around his body. If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry, you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail. When Perry was retired, Mister Harris cut his tail, to make it easier to care for, and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail. Well Perry had been retired here for about two years, but had never had a formal retirement. So in August of nineteen ninety-one, Perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky. That night, Imperator and his trainer, Mister Don Harris, stepped into the ring, one last time together, and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen-eighties. Perry is now twenty years old, and stands fifteen point three hands tall. Ladies and gentlemen, the four-time world grand champion, Imperator..."

40_DEBR,"Does anyone have any questions, while we're. Yes."
40_AUD,What's the average age that a horse lives to.
40_DEBR,"A good average is about twenty-eight, if they're well taken care of. Um, a lotta horses will live into their thirties. A- a good way to compare horse ages to humans, is to multiply by three. And. Except, I think the oldest liv-. Oh, oldest horse on record, I think in the Guinness Book of World Records, was sixty-two. So don't multiply that that one by three. That would be what, a hundred and eighty-six or something. Are there any other questions. No. If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like, when he had his fourteen-foot tail, um, when you come into the visitor center, I don't know if- if anybody noticed this, there's a TV monitor right after you. Where you buy your tickets when you come in, and you look up, and there's a. An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there, and uh, there's a little clip of Imperator on there, and I think he's slowgaiting, which was his most beautiful gait, um, and you can see his fourteen-foot tail up there, and that was-. It was really beautiful... Do you have a question. Back there."
40_AUD,He wants to know how you say hi to a horse.
40_DEBR,"Um, just say hi. You can just say hi, and they-. And you can say their name, cause they know their names. So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator, just. And he goes by Perry, so if you just come up to him and say hi Perry, he'll know you're talking to him. Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions, this is Forego. Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli, and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda. He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky. Due to Forego's large size, he was not raced as a two-year-old, because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature. He started his racing career as a three-year-old. And he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventy-three Kentucky Derby. Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby, on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown. Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day, But he did run a fine race. He was involved in a bumping incident, as the horses left the starting gate. He recovered from that, but he and another horse, Our Native, bumped through the entire stretch, and both horses ended in a photo finish for third. After the steward's inquiry, Forego had to settle for fourth, because the steward said the bumping was all his fault. The older Forego got, the better he got, and he became one of the greatest handicap horses to ever race. He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century. Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha-. Forego had to carry a lot of extra weight, over whatever distance he was asked to run, in order to give the other horses more of a chance. He was in thirty-four handicap events, and thirty times, he was the high-weighted horse. The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory, was a hundred and thirty-seven pounds. And that was in the nineteen seventy-six Marlboro Cup. Well before the race it had rained, and the track was sloppy, and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet. So as the field turned for home, it looked just as if he was hopelessly beaten, some ten lengths behind the leader Honest Pleasure. Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year, He was three years younger than Forego, and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight. But determined to win, Forego made up that last quarter mile, in twenty-two seconds flat, and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire. The jockey that rode Forego, the great Willy Shoemaker, said there wasn't a horse alive, that could've beaten Forego on that day. Forego was named horse of the year, three consecutive years, in nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and seventy-six. And he has also been champion sprinter, as well as champion handicap horse. An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive. And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards, which is more than any other horse. Forego retired in nineteen seventy-eight, with earnings of over one point nine million dollars, which made him the second richest thoroughbred in history at that time, behind Kelso. He was inducted into racing's hall of fame in nineteen seventy-nine. Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions, he is twenty-four years old, and stands a very impressive seventeen point one hands tall. Ladies and gentlemen, the great handicap horse, Forego..."

40_DEBR,"Does anyone have any questions. Questions... Okay, Oh. Okay, I don't have my glasses on, I couldn't see you."
40_AUD,What is the average weight for a horse.
40_DEBR,"Um it varies, um, like probably, let's see, Forego probably weighs around t-, oh about twelve hundred, maybe twelve fifty, some of the draft horses weigh over a ton, in the draft horse barn, some of the. The Belgians are the biggest horses. The- the Shires are the tallest, but the Belgians are the heaviest. And. Have you been to the draft barn yet... uh Did you see Roy and Captain, the two big Belgians, They weigh, they both weigh over two th-. I th-. I know Roy does. I'm not sure about Captain, but Roy weighs over two thousand pounds. Yes."
40_AUD,"Isn't Secretariat, didn't he die, and wasn't he buried on this property somewhere."
40_DEBR,"Uh, uh he's buried at Claiborne Farm."
40_AUD,Claiborne.
40_DEBR,Mhm.
40_AUD,How did he die.
40_DEBR,Pardon.
40_AUD,How did he die.
40_DEBR,"He was put down, he had laminitis, which is a disease of the h-. Of the hoof, and and they put him down. Our next horse to come out today, is our other thoroughbred gelding to be retired here, and you'll see that he's a lot smaller than Forego. This is John Henry. John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings. He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers, who was not much of a racehorse or a stallion either. And he is out of the brood mare Once Double, who outside of John Henry, had very little success as a brood mare. John was born on March ninth nineteen seventy-five, at Golden Chance Farm in Paris Kentucky. The farm kept John until nineteen seventy-six, when he was consigned to the Keenenland January Mixed Sale. Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse, it's usually when people try to sell the horses they don't think are worth feeding through the winter. So because of his small size, his lack of pedigree, but most of all, his very nasty disposition, John brought only eleven hundred dollars. And from the time of this first sale, until May nineteen seventy-eight, John was sold, over half a dozen times, because nobody wanted him, and nobody could get along with him. But in May of nineteen seventy-eight, a New York businessman, Sam Rubin, decided it would be fun to own a racehorse. Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses, and the only thing he knew about racing, is where the valet parking was. So he bought John Henry, over the telephone, sight unseen, for twenty-five thousand dollars. John then went to New York, to his first trainer Bobby Donato. In his very first New York start, he won a twenty-five thousand dollar claiming race, over the dirt, by one and a half lengths. His next race was on turf, which John preferred to run on, and again he won, but this time by fourteen lengths. Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did, advised him to send John west, where the turf racing was more lucrative, more competitive, and run all year long. So in late nineteen seventy-nine, John headed west, to his new trainer, Ronald McAnally. In nineteen eighty, John won over nine-hundred thousand dollars. In nineteen eighty-one, John won the very first Arlington Million, over one point seven million dollars, and was voted horse of the year. In nineteen eighty-two, and nineteen eighty-three, John had some injuries, and only won four races, but they mounted up to one point two million dollars. And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nine-year-old, folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age. Well John did lose his first race that year, but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack. He won six graded stakes, including a repeat victory in the Arlington Million, over two point three million dollars, and again was voted horse of the year. When John was retired in nineteen eighty-four, he was the world's richest thoroughbred in history. With earnings over six point five million dollars. Since then Alisheba has beat his record, but John is still the richest gelding. John holds seven Eclipse Awards, which is second only to Forego's eight, and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety. John was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade, for the nineteen eighties. John has been retired here for eight years now. He is nineteen years old, and stands a very small, fifteen point one hands tall. Ladies and gentlemen, the great great John Henry..."
40_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
40_DEBR,Does anyone have any questions. Yes.
40_AUD,"The horses that retire here, how much exercise, and what kind of <XX> <XX>."
40_DEBR,"Okay. These horses are are not ridden anymore, um, they're just, l- like you said, they're retired, they each have their own paddock, except for Sergeant Pepper and Imperator, they. We turn them out together, because they're friends, and mostly they just hang out in their paddock, and they graze and, they exercise themselves, they run around a lot, and keep themselves in shape, and, that's about all they do. They get, they get lots of treats, and lots of love and, s- we think they're happy. But, they still run around, um, just like young horses, sometimes John will get out there and run around, he'll rear up on his hind legs, like Silver, you know and do. And uh it's real cute, uh Forego'll run around, Willie, and his little goat will get out there and, and run and, Imperator usually likes to trot. He doesn't gallop a lot, but he trots around like he did when he was showing and, it's. They're real cute. There any other questions."
40_AUD,"Yes. What. Uh, the goat in with the horse. Are they just good friends."
40_DEBR,"Uhuh. That's his little buddy. They're just friends. He-. Willie doesn't really like other horses very well. And and he likes people, but he's not as affectionate as maybe Perry, or Sergeant Pepper so, we don't want him to get lonely, and that's his, that's his little friend... Originally they had got the goat for John Henry, when he first came to live here, eight years ago, and they put the goat in the stall with him, he kicked it back out, and um, so Willie adopted it... And that original goat died about a year ago, and Willie was real sad and depressed, so they got him a new one. Our last horse to come out today, is our standardbred representative, Rambling Willie. A standardbred races at a trot or a pace, and they pull a sulky with a driver. Willie is a pacer. Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana, and he began his racing career as a to-year-old, for his owner Raymond Gibson. He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds, so he did show some promise, but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a three-year-old. Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver, Mister Robert Farrington, for fifteen thousand dollars. But not long after he bought him, Mister Farrington decided he'd spent too much money on this horse, so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio, Mister Paul Sebert, and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie. Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before, and his luck had been pretty bad. The first horse he owned died, before it made it to the racetrack, and the second horse he owned made it to the races, and she ran and ran, but just couldn't win anything, so he sold her. And after he sold her, she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner. Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though, and things didn't start off so well there either. Willie was being raced at county fairs, in Ohio and Indiana, and was being beaten on a regular basis. Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday, and he was trying to decide what to get her. So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian, would be the other half of Willie. Well Vivian was a very religious person, and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church. So Vivian decided, that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack, she would donate ten percent, of her half of Willie's earnings, to her father's church. And that's when Willie's racing career took off..."
40_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
40_DEBR,"Because of his success, and his ties to the church, there was a book written about Willie, titled, Rambling Willie, The Horse That God Loved. In order to promote his book, Willie would hold autograph sessions. One day when Willie was in New York, he had an autograph session at Macy's department store. And he was such a hit there, that Macy's gave him his very own charge card..."
40_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
40_DEBR,"Well Willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race. He raced from the age of two to thirteen. He had an incredible three-hundred and five starts. He won a hundred and twenty-eight times, sixty-nine times he finished second, and seventy-nine times he paced the mile, in two minutes or less, which is a record Willie still holds today. When he retired, he was the richest standardbred in history, with earnings over two million dollars. Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions, he is twenty-four years old, and stands fifteen point two hands tall. Ladies and gentlemen, the horse that God loved, Rambling Willie..."

40_DEBR,"Now I'll just let everybody know, that Willie's book is for sale here at the Horse Park gift shop. And we'd like to thank everyone, for coming to the Horse Park, and to the Hall of Champions presentation, we hope you've had a good day, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask us on your way out. Thank you very much..."
