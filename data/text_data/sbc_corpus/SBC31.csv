31_BETH,"No, otherwise he doesn't get lunch."
31_SHER,"Well I know, that's what starving is."
31_BETH,"Actually, I think that if she found out..."
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"He come and didn't have a lunch, she'd fix him one."
31_SHER,Mm...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>

31_ROSE,Maybe she's addicted.
31_SHER,Uh uh a semi- hypochondriac.
31_ROSE,Maybe there's coke in it.
31_BETH,I think that that's closer to the truth.

31_BETH,Yeah. I think you're right.
31_SHER,Oh. Oh...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,I always have... get backaches.
31_BETH,Cause she goes to the doctor a lot.
31_SHER,But.
31_BETH,It seems to me.
31_SHER,"Oh really. I think I get backaches because, I mean some people's bodies are built a certain way."
31_BETH,"Well, bad posture and, just don't take care of it."
31_SHER,"Well yeah, I'm sure that's part of it."
31_BETH,You know.
31_ROSE,"And also, because of the way you sit."
31_SHER,"No but I mean, some people get backaches more than other people."
31_ROSE,And because...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,"You're tall, and the world is built for women who are about five five."
31_SHER,It's. And it's.
31_BETH,And because you're. The body is not...
31_SHER,It's cause of the way my body is.
31_BETH,"The human body. No. But Doctor Hensel told me, that everybody gets backaches."
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_BETH,Because y-. The human bod- backbone.
31_SHER,Oh.
31_BETH,"Not the body, but the backbone."
31_SHER,Right.
31_BETH,Is not built.
31_SHER,Right.
31_BETH,For an animal to walk on two feet.
31_SHER,Oh I see.
31_BETH,It's built for an animal to walk on all fours.
31_SHER,Right. Right.
31_BETH,"So if you were uh... spent your whole life on your hands and knees, you never get a backache. That's basically."
31_ROSE,"Actually, that helps when you have a backache."
31_SHER,Hm. Really.
31_ROSE,"Is to get down on your hands and knees, and walk arou-... and crawl around."
31_BETH,Mm.
31_SHER,"Oh, not crou-. Not all the way down though. Hunh."
31_ROSE,Hm-m.
31_SHER,"It hurt, but then your back's gets sway back."
31_BETH,No but.
31_ROSE,"N- but, uh th- uh."
31_BETH,No if you. But if you're moving it won't. If you just stand there it will.
31_SHER,Oh.
31_ROSE,"Well, you know um."
31_BETH,"You wanna, but when you're moving, you keep it."
31_ROSE,You know Kris Nelson.
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_ROSE,"Well, when I, I asked, when I went in with my arm, you know, cause I had tr- so much trouble with my elbow. And, so, while she was giving me the treatment one time, I asked her about backs. You know."
31_SHER,Mhm.
31_ROSE,"And she said the l-. The newest theory is the opposite. We. They used to say, that you lie flat."
31_SHER,"Oh, I heard this one."
31_ROSE,With your e-. With your knees up.
31_SHER,Yeah. So that it will curve this way.
31_ROSE,So that it curves this way.
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_ROSE,"She says now we're having em do, uh exercises."
31_SHER,The opposite. Arching.
31_ROSE,Where you lie flat on your stomach.
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_ROSE,And you lift your shoulders up.
31_SHER,Mm.
31_ROSE,"And then you keep doing it, until you can have your hands totally straight, and your hips on the. I mean your arms totally straight."
31_SHER,Oh. Yeah.
31_ROSE,And your hips down.
31_BETH,Hm.
31_ROSE,So that you're curved way up.
31_SHER,Right.
31_ROSE,"So I started doing that, and believe it or not, my backache went away."
31_SHER,Really.
31_BETH,"Really. I'll tell Bill. Cause, that."
31_SHER,But I can't.
31_BETH,One night that he was so sick...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"When he first got sick, and he couldn't. He was walking stooped over, his back hurt so bad."
31_ROSE,You have to. You start out real.
31_SHER,Mhm.
31_BETH,Legs.
31_ROSE,Just a little bit.
31_BETH,Were numb.
31_ROSE,You know.
31_BETH,We put four pillows under his knees.
31_ROSE,Uh.
31_BETH,And that backache just about went away...
31_ROSE,"But you see, that's always worked for me too, but it comes back."
31_SHER,Hm.
31_BETH,Now his didn't though.
31_ROSE,"Well, then that's what you-. You know, different people have different ty- kinds."
31_BETH,Well and it was probably just from being sick.
31_ROSE,Uh.
31_BETH,"That caused it, and he just needed to relax it."
31_ROSE,I am conc-.
31_BETH,And that helped him relax.
31_ROSE,Carolyn thinks she's got a kidney infection.
31_BETH,Oh my God...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,"Carolyn's al-... uh Carolyn's almost as bad as Barb, at being sick, but."
31_SHER,She just has these little things that come every once in a while and they're always serious.
31_BETH,Why does she think she had a kidney infection.
31_ROSE,"Well she's got a pain, at at her waist, in the back, on one side only, and she's not, going to the bathroom as often as she should, even though she's drinking gallons of water."
31_BETH,"She's gonna get fat, if she does that."
31_SHER,Water bloating.
31_ROSE,"No, she's gonna get bloated. It's different than fat."
31_SHER,That's fat.
31_BETH,Yes I know.
31_ROSE,No it isn't the same thing.
31_BETH,Looks like...
31_ROSE,"Yeah, but you can lose it real fast..."
31_BETH,Oh I know.
31_ROSE,Once it's...
31_BETH,<XX>...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"So is she gonna go to the doctor, and find out."
31_ROSE,"Well she went yesterday, and the doctor wasn't there, but the physician's assistant, looked at her and thought it was just a muscle spasm. So they gave her some."
31_BETH,Oh.
31_ROSE,"He... uh uh He or she got a some pills for muscle spasms, but it hasn't helped, as of last night it hadn't."
31_BETH,It's at her waist...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Because they told Marleen.
31_ROSE,"In the back, well."
31_BETH,Our kidneys are up under your ribs.
31_ROSE,"Well, the-."
31_SHER,That's weird.
31_ROSE,Right.
31_SHER,I thought they were lower.
31_ROSE,"Right, you know."
31_BETH,Yeah that's what we always thought too.
31_SHER,I always thought they were down here.
31_BETH,Yeah that's what we thought.
31_SHER,Where.
31_ROSE,"But the pain can be just about, you know."
31_BETH,"Oh, yeah I suppose that's true."
31_ROSE,"You know, pain can be just about any place."
31_BETH,"But, they tol-..."
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Marleen had something wrong.
31_SHER,They told her they were uh...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"And, they said your kidneys are up."
31_SHER,Really.
31_BETH,Here.
31_SHER,Oh. That's weird. Hm. Hm.
31_ROSE,I think.
31_BETH,They're higher than I thought.
31_ROSE,Yeah.
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_BETH,I know that...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Cause I always thought they were just below your waist.
31_ROSE,Anyway.
31_SHER,"Yeah, I did too."
31_BETH,But there are...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,She's.
31_BETH,Yeah all sorts of junk in there anyhow.
31_ROSE,Kinda.
31_BETH,Which we don't need.
31_ROSE,"Yeah... Well she thought she had a bladder infection, when she was at Whidbey."
31_BETH,Oh did she. I didn't know that.
31_SHER,"Why, did she have the opposite problem..."
31_ROSE,"Well it's not exactly opposite. But, well they're kinda related aren't they... But."
31_BETH,It's just moving through her system.
31_ROSE,But they didn't even do a urinalysis. Which I think is ridiculous. When she went in yesterday. S-.
31_BETH,But will a urine show kidneys.
31_ROSE,Sure.
31_BETH,Will it show a kidney malfunction.
31_ROSE,If there's an infection.
31_BETH,Oh I didn't know it would...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"I guess it would. Because they did that for Bill, they thought he had a kidney."
31_SHER,Oh they did. But they never figured out what he had.
31_BETH,He had had pneumonia.
31_ROSE,Eventually.
31_BETH,The second week he had pneumonia. The first week he.
31_SHER,Really.
31_ROSE,He had a vi-.
31_BETH,Apparently just had a virus.
31_SHER,"I uh. Oh, I thought it."
31_BETH,Or either that or the-.
31_SHER,They didn't know what he had. He had pneumonia.
31_ROSE,"Yeah, he eventually developed it."
31_SHER,Is that the first time he's ever had pneumonia.
31_BETH,No.
31_SHER,He's had it before...
31_BETH,"<XX>. When he was real little, he almost died of pneumonia."
31_SHER,Oh.
31_BETH,When he was.
31_SHER,Oh really. Hey.
31_BETH,About three.
31_SHER,"So, now Bill and Jonathan are a natural class, right."
31_BETH,Right.
31_SHER,Oh I get it.
31_BETH,But he outgrew it when he was five too. A little older than five...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,When they quit going to Lewiston every week...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,To see his grandmother...
31_SHER,Oh that's when he outgrew it...
31_BETH,"He used to have asthma attacks, every time they'd go to Lewiston."
31_SHER,"Oh. That's a drag, he must have liked her a lot. Hunh... Or was it the cl-."
31_BETH,He doesn't remember.
31_SHER,Oh oh...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,His mom said it was...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,She said she-. They went every... just about every weekend. She hated going.
31_SHER,His mom. Which f- g-. It was Jack's mother.
31_BETH,Mhm.
31_SHER,Oh. Hmm. That's.
31_BETH,But they had to go see her.
31_SHER,Pretty bad.
31_BETH,"But he outgrew it. But, uh it scared Marleen, cause that was one of her dad's problems. One of her dad's problems."
31_SHER,What. Asthma...
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,Oh. Seems like we've got every bad thing there could be in our family.
31_BETH,He had a lot of things though her dad...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"I was talking to a gal at work, Karen Baxter..."
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Karen Berringer Baxter...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"Who's gonna have a baby, uh. She's."
31_SHER,Does she have any already.
31_BETH,Hm-m.
31_SHER,Hm.
31_BETH,She's my age.
31_SHER,"Yeah, I know, I remember Karen."
31_ROSE,Her husband the one that had.
31_SHER,I. Berringer. I know the gal.
31_BETH,"No, her sister's husband."
31_ROSE,Oh okay...
31_BETH,"Um, but, she said they did a um..."
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Glucose tolerance test on her.
31_ROSE,Yeah.
31_BETH,"And there isn't any diabetes in their family, and she goes to doctor Hensel. And there's diabetes in our family, and he never did one on me, for either of the kids."
31_ROSE,Maybe they picked something up in a blood test somewhere.
31_BETH,There must be some-. Oh. That could be.
31_ROSE,Her...
31_BETH,"But. And she had gallbladder problems, right before she got pregnant..."
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,N-.
31_ROSE,Well.
31_BETH,"So, it could be that they're."
31_ROSE,And then there's... And there's such a thing as pregnancy diabetes.
31_BETH,Mhm.
31_ROSE,"Where you don't have it any other time. And, she may have shown signs of that."
31_SHER,Really.
31_ROSE,And then.
31_SHER,I never heard of that.
31_ROSE,Mhm...
31_SHER,Hm. That's pretty weird.
31_BETH,Mhm...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Could be...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"She didn't say, anything about that."
31_ROSE,See I never had that. But Grandmom did...
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,When she was pregnant with me.
31_SHER,Oh she did. Oh...
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,Were you big. When you were born.
31_ROSE,Seven thirteen.
31_SHER,"Oh, so she didn't have one of those classic signs of diabetes."
31_ROSE,"Nope, y- f- usually don't on your first baby."
31_BETH,"See, but I did."
31_ROSE,"But your babies were late, Beth, my babies, none of my babies were late."
31_BETH,"Yeah but, Laura was still big. Even."
31_SHER,"That's what Mom's hoping, that it means, it doesn't mean anything about having diabetes."
31_BETH,Oh.
31_ROSE,I know...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,Laura. Uh d- Laura is.
31_BETH,I mean Laura was big anyhow.
31_ROSE,"Uh was big, would've been big anyway, even if she had been on time."
31_BETH,Cause she was big from the very beginning.
31_ROSE,Yeah.
31_BETH,"I mean I went in at twelve weeks, and he said, this is a big baby or twins."
31_ROSE,Right.
31_SHER,Yeah...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,So she was...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"Bill said t- last night, he said, something about the next kid, I says Bill, I don't want any more kids. I'm kidded out. He says, he looks at me and he goes, Beth, nothing ever flaps you. I said y-..."
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"Now that's not true, he said you could have six kids, and you would just be calm and cool."
31_SHER,Uh.
31_BETH,And just be Beth.
31_SHER,"You go, guess what Bill, you're wrong..."
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,But now Sunday just about did it.
31_SHER,I wouldn't be Beth...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,I wouldn't be Beth anymore...
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,What happened Sunday.
31_BETH,"Oh, I just about had it. With Anna and Sharon. And I told Sharon."
31_SHER,What they were just.
31_ROSE,What were th ey doing.
31_BETH,"They were. Mostly Sharon got on her bandwagon about Missus Jackson, and I just about came un-."
31_ROSE,About who.
31_SHER,Missus Jackson.
31_BETH,Jean Jackson.
31_ROSE,Oh I didn't hear anything about it...
31_BETH,"<XX>. No, you'd left."
31_ROSE,Oh.
31_SHER,It was later.
31_ROSE,Well tell me about it...
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,Cause I hadn't heard all of this.
31_BETH,She was saying that...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"That, that, we were talking about, um, different students being held back for different reasons and that, about, children being put, oh I was telling her about, that one of your girls read at such a low level that, really should have been, and they said well why didn't they put her in remedial, and I said, well I don't know but."
31_ROSE,She was in remedial.
31_BETH,"Well, I said for one thing..."
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"They can't put em in remedial, without the parents' consent. And then, the whole thing about, that Greg went through in, the first part of second grade, his first, and she was so upset because."
31_SHER,What happened. What happened.
31_BETH,They wanted to test him for a remedial class.
31_SHER,"Who, Greg."
31_BETH,Greg.
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_ROSE,It isn't a remedial class.
31_SHER,They wanted to test him.
31_ROSE,It's called resource room.
31_BETH,Okay.
31_SHER,Yeah. I know.
31_BETH,Resource room.
31_SHER,But.
31_BETH,Whatever.
31_SHER,Just a reme-.
31_ROSE,And she wouldn't let em.
31_SHER,One.
31_BETH,"Well, uh she never did anything about it. But she was telling Anna."
31_SHER,They never tested him.
31_BETH,That Missus Jackson.
31_SHER,Or they did.
31_BETH,"Demanded he go into the resource room. I said Sharon, that's not right. I said she suggested he be tested for it. That's two different things. That was the first thing I said. And then she was saying, well she just didn't do Greg any good. You know, and I just about, I didn't..."
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"I didn't, b- but I, you know I told Bill later I said, Greg learned more from Missus Jackson, than he ever learned from Missus Meyer."
31_ROSE,Oh well. Probably.
31_BETH,"Because, he tried harder for her."
31_ROSE,Mhm.
31_BETH,You know. And he really.
31_ROSE,"Here's our lunch, finally."
31_BETH,"And he, he made a complete sw-... not complete, but he'd im-. Made a big improvement."
31_ROSE,Mhm.
31_SHER,Mm.
31_JAMI,The Caesar salad with the kebabs.
31_SHER,Hm.
31_BETH,That was mine.
31_JAMI,"Okay, he made the kebabs a little bit bigger than I... regular, and I made the salad a little bigger, so we put em on separate plates."
31_BETH,Oh wow...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"And I'm gonna get full then, hunh."
31_SHER,What a deal.
31_ROSE,I had the croissant. Mm. Thank you.
31_SHER,Thanks.
31_BETH,And.
31_JAMI,Is everything alright now.
31_ROSE,Looks fine.
31_BETH,Looks delicious.
31_SHER,Looks good.
31_JAMI,Okay great.
31_BETH,"Thank you. So, and that was."
31_ROSE,Mm.
31_BETH,"That kind of, I mean she was going."
31_SHER,Bugged you.
31_BETH,"And then she said, she says well, and if. She-. Missus Jackson is still there, when Doug gets to second grade, she's not gonna get her hands on him."
31_SHER,Oh brother.
31_BETH,"And I said Greg, Doug would probably do wonderful in her class. Greg did w- r-... finally did well. Well and, for one thing it bothered me, because Anna takes ahold of something like that and doesn't let go. And Sharon doesn't even think about what she's saying. She just starts y-, nya-nya-nya-nya, and I was just."
31_ROSE,"You should tell Sharon, that principals do not take kindly to parents telling em what room they want their kids in..."
31_SHER,Mm.
31_BETH,I thought boy. They oughta put Doug in there just to show her...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,Mm.
31_ROSE,Sh- probably just as well I'm not having Doug.
31_BETH,Well she just.
31_ROSE,I mean Greg.
31_BETH,There's just the whole attitude. That...
31_SHER,"What, what grade is Doug in."
31_ROSE,He's starting first next year. In kindergarten this year.
31_SHER,Hm. Hm.
31_BETH,"But, you know, like, she knows, so much about it. You know. I said probably that one day the. The teacher and you both just had a bad day, and it came off on."
31_SHER,Yeah.
31_ROSE,Probably just as well I wasn't there...
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,"Oh, I was, I told Bill, I had several things I wanted to say, and I probably would've, if Anna wouldn't've been there..."
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_BETH,But I watch myself a lot closer around her. M-.
31_ROSE,"This is good clam chowder, but it's not as good as Uncle Don made."
31_SHER,"He made some. Oh, after they had gone clamming."
31_ROSE,One of those...
31_BETH,"You know, I don't think Sharon would've said it, if you'd've been around."
31_ROSE,She better not.
31_SHER,Uncle Don made it...
31_ROSE,<NONVERBAL>
31_SHER,After you w-.
31_ROSE,"Yeah, but."
31_SHER,They went clamming.
31_ROSE,"Surprisingly enough Sherry, it didn't taste real clammy."
31_SHER,Really.
31_ROSE,Mhm.
31_SHER,Hm.
31_BETH,Yeah it wasn't all that good.
31_ROSE,"Well it was good, but, it didn't."
31_SHER,Yeah what's the use of having clam chowder.
31_ROSE,It wa- didn't.
31_SHER,If it doesn't taste like clam.
31_ROSE,"Because evidently, fresh clams don't, haven't developed a real strong flavor yet."
31_BETH,Hunh- unh.
31_SHER,How do they get their flavor. Being canned or something.
31_ROSE,I would think so.
31_SHER,Oh. Hm.
31_BETH,And refrigerated.
31_SHER,Mm.
31_ROSE,Just aging...
31_SHER,Hm.
31_BETH,Um hm.
31_ROSE,"Oh, I had a s- soupspoon and didn't see it. Till just now..."
31_SHER,<NONVERBAL>
31_ROSE,Oh well.
31_BETH,<NONVERBAL>
