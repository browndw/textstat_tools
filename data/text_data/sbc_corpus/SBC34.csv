34_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
34_KARE,I'm so tired.
34_SCOT,Tired.
34_KARE,"It was uh. It was okay, I left my bag there. I left my bag, and all my money, and all my things."
34_SCOT,Now the ghosts'll get it.
34_KARE,"They ca-. Ghosts'll get it, that's okay... Um, ten thirty, there were probably thirty people in the store."
34_SCOT,Good grief.
34_KARE,"We're like, okay, it's time to go out now. We're closed. We're closed. We are closed now... Please leave."
34_SCOT,Turn on the fire alarm.
34_KARE,"I. Turn on the fire alarm, that would do it... These kids were- came in, and, I was like, w- we're closing uh. In a few minutes, they said, well we'll. We'll wait until you kick us out. Cause they didn't really want to buy anything, they just wanted to look."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"And I said, okay, we're closed. Out... And, so I was moving them, like making them go out."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"And they were trying to be cute, and say sweet things, and. To stay in."
34_SCOT,"Yeah, lots of student types."
34_KARE,"Yeah, there are a lot, but there are mostly families, so in terms of being uh."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"Umm, and so, kids said well, are there any oth-. What time's it, eleven. I said, no it's ten thirty, it's past our closing time actually. And, they said, well are there any other. That what are the other bookstores open in town. Now. I'm like, come on. It's ten thirty. This is the latest thing open besides ice cream stores and bars."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"And, some other guy came in, I felt kinda bad, but, I guess I'm glad I said what I said, there's some guy came in who. N he looked like a student, sort of a student type but, ver- nicely kept. Friendly looking. And basically needed a place to stay because, he ended up in town with twenty dollars. And, I mean, couldn't get to Amherst, cause of no car, and no buses, and, no hotels that were open and."
34_SCOT,You mean buses weren't running then.
34_KARE,Et cetera.
34_SCOT,Hmm.
34_KARE,"And he wanted to know if I knew anyone who would put him up. And, I referred him down to Paul. Cause I just, and then, I felt like, oh I wanted to."
34_SCOT,Mhm...
34_KARE,"But at the same time I thought, well that's a better thing and should we talk to John about."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,And I also just wasn't quite comfortable.
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"But at the same time, I would have been comfortable I think. So, I don't know. Je ne sais pas. Oh the other thing I found out, I h- was returning the book on uh, co-housing."
34_SCOT,Uhuh.
34_KARE,"And um, Paul. And, well, first Paul said, oh I have this friend named Sarah in Hart- in Hartford, and she has this place that deals with co-op, what's it, co-op initiatives."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"And um, they s-. Oo. I'm sore. Oo. She deals a lot with alternative kinda housing, and co-housing, and housing for the sake of people and stuff."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"So we were talking about that, and then while we were talking about that, um, a lady came to buy something, and, she s- gave me the name of this other. This Amherst architect, who s-... started two co-housing developments, in this area."
34_SCOT,Hm...
34_KARE,"It was just so funny to, and uh, Jen and I put a note in the log."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,In the book check-out thing.
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"By my the. So I wrote down the name of the book to check it out, and she put a note said, oh neat, I've got a friend who's in a co-housing place, in Denver. In like Colo- s-. I think it was in Denver."
34_SCOT,Uhuh...
34_KARE,So it was pretty wild.
34_SCOT,Uhuh.
34_KARE,I have to pee.
34_SCOT,Okay.
34_KARE,"Oh... <XX> my shoes first, I'm so tired. So so so tired. I didn't buy any books. I couldn't decide what I wanted, and then, things just got too harried and I, just didn't think it was the right time to buy a book."
34_SCOT,Mm...
34_KARE,<NONVERBAL>
34_SCOT,We got more stuff for your dad.
34_KARE,What kinda stuff.
34_SCOT,"Umm, computer access places."
34_KARE,Like places you could plug into...
34_SCOT,<XX> <XX>. Plug in to get email and stuff.
34_KARE,Or. Aw.
34_SCOT,"And I also, fiddled around and, figured out how I can get things to print out two on a page."
34_KARE,Oo.
34_SCOT,S- take up less paper.
34_KARE,Unhunh.
34_SCOT,"You need a magnifying glass, but."
34_KARE,No I think it's okay.
34_SCOT,In better light.
34_KARE,Yeah we have to get a light. Y. Oo I have to go to the bathroom really bad. Here.
34_SCOT,Okay.
34_KARE,Take this back. I gotta take my sock off. Be right back.
34_SCOT,"Yes lighting is an issue, that needs to be addressed in this house..."
34_KARE,"So, it seems like a fairly basic one. That we could address fairly easily uh, I was thinking we should walk down sometime to h-... to the umm, eeya eeya eeya, to the lighting place, down by."
34_SCOT,"Mhm, why don't you just go."
34_KARE,Well because I wanna. I wanna do things orderly...
34_SCOT,<NONVERBAL>
34_KARE,Sorry...
34_SCOT,<NONVERBAL>
34_KARE,Scott.
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"I used the rest of the orange juice, but I put the container back, in the fridge. So that we don't have to wash it, you can just make more orange juice tomorrow."
34_SCOT,"Okay. So far, the cheapest place I found in here is, in Portland Oregon."
34_KARE,How much is it.
34_SCOT,It's like six dollars a month.
34_KARE,That's okay...
34_SCOT,Mm.
34_KARE,"See the thing is, this light, it's cute there."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"It's not particularly practical there, I mean light does come through there, but if you're gonna sit there and read, you need light. Next to it."
34_SCOT,Well would it work to put it on the other end.
34_KARE,It wouldn't be as.
34_SCOT,It wouldn't be as aesthetically pleasing.
34_KARE,Mhm. Right... That radiator tilts.
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,Hm...
34_SCOT,<NONVERBAL>
34_KARE,"So I got to look at the copy, of umm, it's Dante's Inferno."
34_SCOT,Mhm...
34_KARE,"It's a new translation, with twenty different contemporary American poets. Got different cantos."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,And translated them. And so it's neat. Cause there's these poets that I like. And they've done translations.
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"Of these different. Of the different cantos or, cantos or, whatever toes. And um, they, well it's expensive, it's expensive but it's hard cover. And it's nice. And it matches kind of this, bath book, this scented bath book, that I wanna get."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"And I wasn't pla-. I don't really need it, the Divine-. I don't need either one, I wasn't urgently planning on getting the Divine Comed-. The. The Inferno one. But, the way they look together is very nice. Those two books together. So I was thinking it's sort of an aesthetic thing. That it would be nice to get them together. At a time, I'm gonna have a little vacation, so I can sit in the bath and, have my scented bath. And then I could read."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,"I do realize it's a little bit far out, it seems like there's. Danielle said we need to, the Alexandra Stoddard book back."
34_SCOT,Uhuh.
34_KARE,"They returned. I think they returned the one. The Creating a Beautiful Home one. The one that I had that had the, the blue and red writing."
34_SCOT,"Oh, uhuh."
34_KARE,"It's not there, it's not in our inventory anymore. Maybe it means that."
34_SCOT,Uh-oh.
34_KARE,"Maybe the paperback's going out. And so they wanted to give the hard ba- cover back. I don't know, I was very disturbed."
34_SCOT,Uh-oh.
34_KARE,I can always order another one if I need to...
34_SCOT,<NONVERBAL>
34_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
34_SCOT,<NONVERBAL>
34_KARE,Is that a program you're reading.
34_SCOT,Hm. Hm-mm.
34_KARE,Guess it's a-.
34_SCOT,"It was just a list of uh, places that offer emails for- service, and different things."
34_KARE,"Oh well that's good. Oh, you know maybe if we could turn the spider plant around."
34_SCOT,Which one.
34_KARE,The one that just looks kinda decrepit.
34_SCOT,That one.
34_KARE,Yeah.
34_SCOT,"Maybe we could. I think it, would probably do better, if it got its babies trimmed off."
34_KARE,"I mean can it wait. I think we thought about doing that in the springtime, then I thought we'd replant them."
34_SCOT,"Yeah, but I think there's more babies than we need."
34_KARE,"Would. Yeah. And we've got three new babies that I could replant, but I haven't, already."
34_SCOT,Unhunh. And that. Yeah the...
34_KARE,<NONVERBAL>
34_SCOT,"The other plant over there is, has lots of babies..."
34_KARE,"Oh, I looked at Orlando today."
34_SCOT,The book.
34_KARE,Yeah. Do you think you want to read that together. That interest you at all.
34_SCOT,Unhunh.
34_KARE,"Cause if it. If it really wouldn't, if you're just saying that to make me happy, then."
34_SCOT,"No, I thi-."
34_KARE,I didn't n yeah.
34_SCOT,"I'm, I think it probably would."
34_KARE,It seemed like it would be fun to read out loud. And I don't wanna start it if we're going to read it together. I don't want to start it on my own.
34_SCOT,"I wonder if if it would be, any less abstract than the."
34_KARE,Yeah there's a lot more conversa-.
34_SCOT,More.
34_KARE,There's a lot more in the book. Like the part where she falls on the ground.
34_SCOT,Could be easier to follow.
34_KARE,"And says, I am nature's bride."
34_SCOT,Unhunh.
34_KARE,She also says several other things. And there's also commentary from the narrator.
34_SCOT,Unhunh.
34_KARE,After that.
34_SCOT,Unhunh.
34_KARE,"So I kinda like the movie better that way. Cause it's, gets the point across."
34_SCOT,Unhunh.
34_KARE,"Simply. So, yeah, there's more in it."
34_SCOT,Your basic account from Near Net is two hundred and fifty dollars a month...
34_KARE,", That's a lot."
34_SCOT,That's who Smith connects to.
34_KARE,Well if you're Smith it's one thing.
34_SCOT,Use the Internet.
34_KARE,If you're dad it's another.
34_SCOT,Actually it's the five colleges.
34_KARE,Oh.
34_SCOT,Oh.
34_KARE,I wanted to call Jenny.
34_SCOT,But it <XX>.
34_KARE,I do want to call Jen.
34_SCOT,Well you can call Jenny.
34_KARE,I'm tired.
34_SCOT,Mm.
34_KARE,Maybe I'll call Jenny anyway. Jenny anyway. Jenny-any. Jenny-any.
34_SCOT,Jenny Garret.
34_KARE,Cause I wanted to ask her about the.
34_SCOT,Hm.
34_KARE,"Magazines she's had... Did I tell you that the woman who does. This book here. Monsieur, uh."
34_SCOT,Unhunh.
34_KARE,"This book here. Okay she did the art here. And other art. Uh it said in here, that she does clip art. For different kinds of uh liturgical things. And I found there's two books, listed, under her name, besides this one. But they are clip art books."
34_SCOT,Mhm.
34_KARE,One is for feasts and celebrations. And one is for something. They're like that. They have neat titles.
34_SCOT,You just need to get yourself a clip art book and a scanner.
34_KARE,And a scanner. What would I do with a scanner.
34_SCOT,And then you'd like load em into your computer and make your things with them.
34_KARE,"Aw yeah, then I wouldn't need a Xerox machine, and tape and glue and stuff."
34_SCOT,Yeah. See then you could...
34_KARE,<NONVERBAL>
34_SCOT,"You could scan them, and then you could, make them different colors, and sizes, and things like that. And you could do neat things with them."
34_KARE,Different colors and sizes. I'd need a color printer.
34_SCOT,Yeah.
34_KARE,Yeah. Little minor. How much is a color printer.
34_SCOT,"Umm, you can get a color version of the printer I have for, gosh, I don't know, five hundred dollars."
34_KARE,Would it be good.
34_SCOT,It's reasonable.
34_KARE,"Look at this. When does this go to. We have to go far away away though. Three hundred ninety-nine, gracefully styled, Queen Anne wing recliner, with cherry finish legs..."
34_SCOT,<NONVERBAL>
34_KARE,Do you wanna Queen Anne wing recliner.
34_SCOT,Hm-mm.
34_KARE,Why not.
34_SCOT,I already looked at those.
34_KARE,You didn't like them.
34_SCOT,Not really.
34_KARE,"You get them in different colors Scott, you don't have to get the high aqua. And I could probably get. Reclining love seat. Reclining sofa. Since when have they started that."
34_SCOT,"Don't you remember, we looked through like Sears catalogues, and stuff like that, and there was these."
34_KARE,Oh yeah.
34_SCOT,"Really amazing complete things, you know, with built-in tables, and storage."
