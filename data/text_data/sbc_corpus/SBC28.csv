28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,What are you going into purr mode...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,"Oh, gosh, we kept missing you. Hunh."
28_JEFF,"I know, it's been a while."
28_JILL,"Last night, and today."
28_JEFF,It's been a long time.
28_JILL,It's been so long. I know. You missed like all the drama here...
28_JEFF,No drama.
28_JILL,"Yeah, there was such drama. There was drama, and there was suspense. And then there was relief, and then there was ecstasy..."
28_JEFF,No.
28_JILL,"Well, I'll."
28_JEFF,Not the ecstasy...
28_JILL,Ecstasy of sorts... u-.
28_JEFF,"Wait, tell me what. Well see I-, The reas-. I have. I kinda, I wasn't inclined to call you."
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,Because I just wanted to give you and Jill your time.
28_JILL,Yeah.
28_JEFF,You know. Like I felt like.
28_JILL,Totally.
28_JEFF,"You know, so that's. I let. There were a couple times when I wanted to call you, and I didn't for that reason."
28_JILL,"Uh, Unhunh. Aw thanks. Yeah, well the thing was, I hadn't told you. But my period is really late. You know. And I guess, we would talk, and then we'd hang up, and then I thought, oh, gosh, I forgot to tell you. But."
28_JEFF,I've been meaning to ask you about that.
28_JILL,Really. You were getting nervous.
28_JEFF,You haven't had it yet.
28_JILL,"No. I mean, and it's been so long. And so it's like eight days late. And I thought, I'm sure I'm pregnant. I'm positive. And I was waiting till Jill got here."
28_JEFF,That's bad.
28_JILL,To even try to check.
28_JEFF,Oh. Yeah.
28_JILL,"And um, so we went to go get an EPT... at- pregnancy test."
28_JEFF,Yeah.
28_JILL,And then we d-. That's why we were calling you last night. You know...
28_JEFF,What happened.
28_JILL,"And then, of course it came out fine. So that's the."
28_JEFF,It came out negative.
28_JILL,"Yeah, so that's the relief and the ecstasy."
28_JEFF,"So, y- you can't be pregnant."
28_JILL,No. I don't. No. Unless it was a false negative...
28_JEFF,<XX>.
28_JILL,Which I doubt. Because.
28_JEFF,That's rare. Right.
28_JILL,Right. I think that would be really rare.
28_JEFF,"So, th- you know what I mean, like can, would it come out nega-. Let's say i- i- if you were pregnant, in its early st-, early early stages."
28_JILL,Mhm.
28_JEFF,"Like wo-, Like would a negative. You know what I'm saying."
28_JILL,M.
28_JEFF,Like could you get. Is it possible that you could still be posi- positive.
28_JILL,"I think there'd be a slight chance, of it being a false negative. But, I don't think so, cause I'm pretty late. And I think I'm late enough, where I would have, like, enough of the hormone that the pregnancy test tests for. I think I would have enough of that in my urine, that of course it would show up... if I had any in there."
28_JEFF,Yeah.
28_JILL,You know. So I. I I'm pret-. I took that as a pretty good sign.
28_JEFF,Oh my god.
28_JILL,You know.
28_JEFF,"Honey, how come you've been keeping all this inside."
28_JILL,"I know, I didn't mean to keep it inside..."
28_JEFF,<XX>.
28_JILL,I mean-. I didn't mean.
28_JEFF,Don't you love me.
28_JILL,Oh.
28_JEFF,Aw.
28_JILL,"I didn't mean to not tell you at all. It was just, we would hang up the phone, then I thought, oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I'm kinda late. Cause I didn't think it was a huge deal, but then, I guess I wasn't trying. I think I was in a bit of denial. Like I wasn't really thinking about it much. You know, cause I knew once Jill got here, then I would go get the test."
28_JEFF,So is that all the drama.
28_JILL,"That was the drama. And that was the suspense, and that was the relief, and that was the ecstasy."
28_JEFF,Really.
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,"Oh, honey."
28_JILL,Oh.
28_JEFF,Little bunny is going through the whole wide spectrum of emotions...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,She's doing it without me...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,She's going solo on this...
28_JILL,I'm going solo.
28_JEFF,This is Jillpan going solo.
28_JILL,I know...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,"I thought it was so funny, last night, like what if it came back positive. And then that would mean, the next time I talked to you, I'd be telling you that I was pregnant. And then I thought gosh, poor Jeff, like I hadn't given you any like, you know, like I hadn't warned you, or anything. And it would have been such a surprise."
28_JEFF,Totally.
28_JILL,I thought oh my gosh. I was even g-.
28_JEFF,That would've been.
28_JILL,"Gonna bring the camera into the bathroom, to take a picture of the EPT. Cause I thought..."
28_JEFF,<XX>.
28_JILL,"You know, it's like such a momentous occasion, like what if it came out positive..."
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,"And then I thought, of cour-. Like I'm- know I wouldn't have it or anything, but I thought if the slight chance I would have it, and it really became a person someday, wouldn't they love to see the photograph of the EPT..."
28_JEFF,<XX>.
28_JILL,With the positive sign on it. Knowing that that was like its first sign of life.
28_JEFF,Unhunh. Oh my g-.
28_JILL,I know it's kind of...
28_JEFF,Kind of spooky...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,It's not my idea of a good time right now sweetie.
28_JILL,"Oh, sorry..."
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Maybe somewhere down the road, but right now it kind of makes me sick."
28_JILL,Uh...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,"Right-, I know I know, me too..."
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,Me too...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,I was very...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,But it was just a thought that went through my head...
28_JEFF,No that's a very cute thought...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,Cho-. Let's chock that up as a very cute thought...
28_JILL,You know me and cameras...
28_JEFF,Aw honey.
28_JILL,"Aw, so how are you."
28_JEFF,Know what's even better.

28_JEFF,"You go, I'm the mom..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>

28_JILL,Oh gosh.
28_JEFF,Next to the result.
28_JILL,Oh gosh...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>

28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,Hunh.
28_JILL,Yeah.
28_JEFF,The whole cycle of life. What a fucking trip...
28_JILL,I know.
28_JEFF,"Oh but di-. I d- uh. I know you would you get excited about things like this too, but did you read in the paper, about the um planets... cir- circulating around other stars."
28_JILL,"No, what about them."
28_JEFF,"There's irr-... irreb-... irred-, There's proof. What's the, what's the word that goes before proof."
28_JILL,Irrefutable.
28_JEFF,Irrefutable proof.
28_JILL,What's the word that goes before proof.
28_JEFF,"There, thank you honey, That was so good..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,What a good team we are...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"I could just see myself like lecturing to a bunch of people and, like, oh honey, by the way. What's that word that..."
28_JILL,that goes before honor.
28_JEFF,"Irrefutable Jeff, I'm like..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Oh yes yes yes, thank you very much. What would I be without her..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Um, wouldn't that be funny."
28_JILL,"Uh, Yeah."
28_JEFF,Aw honey. Wouldn't that be funny.
28_JILL,That would be.
28_JEFF,"Like if someone was lecturing. And they said, they looked at you..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"They said, is my wife here, m well..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"And, then she raises her hand..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Oh honey, what wor- were we talking about the other night."
28_JILL,What's that word I'm looking for honey.
28_JEFF,"You know, when..."
28_JILL,You know what I'm talking about...
28_JEFF,I. Wouldn't the whole place just laugh.
28_JILL,Yeah. I think it's so funny.
28_JEFF,"Okay, anyway. Can I run this by you really quick."
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,"There's this scientist, that came up with irrefutable proof... that, there are, there- they found two planets circulating around a sun. Or... a star... in the universe... outside of our solar system."
28_JILL,Really.
28_JEFF,"Uh And so, which like made me think, you know like, you know like how we have always talked about life being out there, you know."
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,"Like there has to be. Cause there's planets evolving around, um."
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,You know various stars and stuff. Just like ours.
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,"And, but see I never knew that that was just a theory. You know, an- a theory that there were planets going around other stars."
28_JILL,You mean you actually thought that we had seen this before.
28_JEFF,"No. No. Actually tha- I I. No I didn't, I just. I just thought that it was like pretty much factual."
28_JILL,"Oh, yeah..."
28_JEFF,<XX>.
28_JILL,Not at all.
28_JEFF,"So, you know. So, it's kind of like a leap of faith, you know that uh we have always thought that."
28_JILL,M.
28_JEFF,"You know. I mean like, like the scientist who who does it, can't really prove it. Like they, they make this leap... of faith, you know, they just assume. Right... that there w- there were planets."
28_JILL,Mhm.
28_JEFF,Around other suns. Right.
28_JILL,"Right. Just by the sheer numbers. They thought, well what are the chances. You know, if we have billions and millions of stars... then chances are. You know, even if it takes like one in a million chance, for there to be another planetary system. Well, like <XX> we have millions and millions and billions of opportunities, to have that happen."
28_JEFF,Unhunh.
28_JILL,"So, I think that's the whole thing, like Carl Sagan... would always go yeah, billions and billions, like, he would say that."
28_JEFF,Unhunh.
28_JILL,"I think he would say that. But, yeah. So anyhow, like w- in what galaxy. Like what solar-. Like what... what galaxy was this star in."
28_JEFF,Uh Santa Barbara...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,No... I'm not sure...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,I don't know the the details. But...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Anyway, what it made me think about was..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"The fact that, you know how you always, this might sound a little silly."
28_JILL,M...
28_JEFF,"But you know how like you, like I, I, I'm very passionate about certain ideas..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,You know.
28_JILL,Really.
28_JEFF,Like...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,You know what I mean.
28_JILL,Yes.
28_JEFF,"How. And then you're like more scientific, or you're more, you know, open to other possibilities."
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,"You know like in, like... you know like you're ch-, um, just- uh... even with people. But, with the ide-, Like you would-. Like you would ask, like how do you know for sure. You know."
28_JILL,M.
28_JEFF,"And, it's like, you know like the. Oh I don't know. Where was I going with this..."
28_JILL,"That, and now, here it is. Here is the factual proof, and so I can be satisfied."
28_JEFF,"That. Yeah. Well, just to show you that, you know like, you can make an assumption. And, you can assume something that feels, you know, really correct, and and it turns out to be that way."
28_JILL,"Sure, some of the time..."
28_JEFF,Uh yeah.
28_JILL,"I feel like, well if you also felt that, I don't know, you could feel something that wouldn't be proved right."
28_JEFF,Yeah.
28_JILL,"But, no, but I think that's so exciting honey."
28_JEFF,No it's okay honey.
28_JILL,I didn't see that in the newspaper.
28_JEFF,It's okay sweetie.
28_JILL,Oh.
28_JEFF,I did. It was more exciting when I was thinking about it the other night.
28_JILL,"No, it's so exciting. I mean, I. I'm s-."
28_JEFF,"No, my whole idea about."
28_JILL,"I mean it's so exciting, that I- d- like don't even believe you. Like, I think it's that exciting."
28_JEFF,Oh my God.
28_JILL,I mean like I feel like it's.
28_JEFF,You don't believe me.
28_JILL,No it's so exciting that I feel like.
28_JEFF,That's.
28_JILL,I want to go read it in the newspaper for myself. Like I can't believe it. Like how come it's not on the news...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,And.
28_JEFF,I know.
28_JILL,There aren't like parties now...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"And they even, u they've been studying the two planets."
28_JILL,Mhm.
28_JEFF,And their patterns. And how they like s-...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Um, they, they circle the the their star."
28_JILL,Unhunh.
28_JEFF,"And, they think that there's not, it can't, those planets can't sustain life."
28_JILL,"Oh, just from the distance from it."
28_JEFF,"Uh No. From um, like, from their surface. The the planet's surface."
28_JILL,Oh. They can see that.
28_JEFF,"Well, that's weird. They get it from, like they pick up heat waves."
28_JILL,Oh.
28_JEFF,"You know, and it's, it's just, obviously they can't se- really see anything..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"They-. The only way they could tell that the planets are out there, like they can tell like the stars are, are out there are, just by radio waves. And, and how. You know what."
28_JILL,"God, that's so incredible."
28_JEFF,"And heat waves... uh I t- i- it's unbelievable, how man has, you know like."
28_JILL,From this little point...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,"In the whole universe... like, we've been able to tell so much, just with science."
28_JEFF,"I know, isn't it wild..."
28_JILL,"<XX>, Just with, aw, that's so incredible."
28_JEFF,That sends me out there.
28_JILL,Wow...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,Totally. Oh. Wow. That's so exciting...
28_JEFF,"Oh, honey, you're not pregnant."
28_JILL,No. I'm s-.
28_JEFF,Y- you were convinced you were pregnant.
28_JILL,"Well, I only got convinced the moment before I was waiting for the results. Like all before that, uh well I'm late. But I don't feel any of the symptoms. But I got so nervous, right when I was taking the test. I was kind of not treating it, taking it that seriously. Cause it's just, it's such an unbelievable concept... to think that maybe I would be pregnant. So I wasn't really believing it..."
28_JEFF,<XX>.
28_JILL,"And then, but the moment that I did the test, I got so scared, and I thought, oh my God, like, this isn't kidding around, like what if I am, and it's a distinct possibility, and I got so scared, like you-."
28_JEFF,Did you cry.
28_JILL,"No, I didn't cry. But Jill was here, like she wa-. It was so scary, and, but, you know, we were watching it, and it didn't turn blue, or."
28_JEFF,Aw.
28_JILL,"You know, so, it was, you know, it was."
28_JEFF,Are you sure it would have been mine...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"You know I would've denied it, if you, if you said it was mine..."
28_JILL,"I was uh, messing around with the repair man."
28_JEFF,Honey.
28_JILL,Aw.
28_JEFF,"Honey, I'm just kidding my love..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,You'd sure learn a lot about me if that happened...
28_JILL,Gosh...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Aw honey, that would just like ruin your whole idea of who I am. Hunh."
28_JILL,Aw.
28_JEFF,"It would just like, I'd just blow up everything that we had, if I, if I was that cruel."
28_JILL,If you just refuted it.
28_JEFF,If I said no way.
28_JILL,T- nunh-unh. I'm not taking any responsibility.
28_JEFF,"If it's mine, then it's your fault for getting pregnant."
28_JILL,Oh God.
28_JEFF,Would. Oh no...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,You think we'd be able to...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,To make it through that. If I...
28_JILL,I don't think s-...
28_JEFF,Would you. Would you be able to look above that...
28_JILL,Would you forgive that...
28_JEFF,Just let that one thing pass...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,No way...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,I wouldn't let you.
28_JILL,Oh.
28_JEFF,Well...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"I just want you to get pregnant. So you could see how uh, I'm gonna take it."
28_JILL,S- oh.
28_JEFF,I'll love you and support you.
28_JILL,M.
28_JEFF,Send you some money...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,Great...
28_BOTH,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,Oh...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,Sweetness.
28_JILL,Oh.
28_JEFF,What a pain in the ass that would be...
28_JILL,"I know... you know what, I think m, m-... out of anything, it would just be that, that would bother me. Just like, I don't have the time to deal with it. Like w-, you know. Like, what a pain in the neck..."
28_JEFF,"<XX>, We have to be really safe this summer."
28_JILL,Totally. Well I'm gonna go on the pill.
28_JEFF,"Oh honey, are you sure."
28_JILL,"Yeah. Yeah totally, it it's..."
28_JEFF,"Yeah what are we gonna use, condoms."
28_JILL,Right.
28_JEFF,Well they're coming out with condoms for women.
28_JILL,"Right, well."
28_JEFF,"I would never in a million years expect you to wear something like that, honey..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,I swear to God. I think those are the grossest contraptions ever.
28_JILL,I saw one act-. Really.
28_JEFF,Yeah.
28_JILL,I just saw one the other day actually...
28_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
28_JILL,They're strange looking...
28_JEFF,Wow... <XX> <XX>...
28_JILL,"We had a woman, um, a physician come and talk to us, about all the different kinds of contraception, and, um, to tell us about R U four eighty-six. Is that the drug."
28_JEFF,Unhunh. Unhunh.
28_JILL,"To tell us about that, and norplant, and the side effects of everything, and, it was so interesting..."
28_JEFF,Wow.
28_JILL,Yeah.
28_JEFF,Well is R U um forty six.
28_JILL,It was really neat.
28_JEFF,Is that gonna be implemented.
28_JILL,"Well, it's not, it's not available here in the United States, it's only in France."
28_JEFF,England.
28_JILL,"And, yeah, and Sweden. Right."
28_JEFF,"But I mean is that, are they, are there people trying to make it law here."
28_JILL,"I think so, but, I just think, you know, politically I, I doubt it will be."
28_JEFF,Yeah.
28_JILL,For a while. Such a bummer.
28_JEFF,"Yeah. It's such a great, you know. That would be so great if people could get that."
28_JILL,Oh yeah.
28_JEFF,Stay away from those pro-lifers...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,Throwing things at em.
28_JILL,"Oh, I know I know. Gosh, you know what sweetie. I think I'm gonna go, like rescue Jill. Because she's been there, and, she's probably doesn't know anybody, and, you know."
28_JEFF,"Okay, honey..."
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"You- you're choosing, you can choose."
28_JILL,Oh honey.
28_JEFF,I'm just kidding...
28_JILL,<NONVERBAL>
28_JEFF,"Oh, I'm so glad you guys are having a good time."
28_JILL,"N yeah, oh it's so great. It's so great."
28_JEFF,"Aw, well give."
28_JILL,It's so nice. It-.
28_JEFF,Give her a hug for me.
28_JILL,Okay. It's almost surreal... NA
