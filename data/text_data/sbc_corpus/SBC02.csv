02_JAMI,How can you teach a three-year-old to tap dance.
02_HARO,"I can't imagine teaching a. Yeah, really..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Who suggested this to em.
02_HARO,"I have no idea. It was probably my sister-in-law's idea because, I think they saw that movie."
02_JAMI,Tap... <XX> <XX>.
02_HARO,What was the.
02_MILE,They had.
02_HARO,The movie with that really hot tap dancer.
02_JAMI,Oh that kid.
02_MILE,"He was actually here two weeks ago, and I missed him."
02_JAMI,At the at the jazz tap thing or whatever.
02_HARO,Was he a little kid.
02_MILE,No he's sixteen now.
02_JAMI,"No he's like. Yeah he's a teenager, but he teaches these classes in New York."
02_MILE,"That boy, he's supposed to be awesome."
02_JAMI,Yeah. Really fast.
02_PETE,Hm.
02_HARO,But I'm sure that was the the impetus.
02_MILE,Have you seen him.
02_JAMI,No. I just read an article on him.
02_MILE,You you probably read the same Examiner article I read.
02_JAMI,"Yeah, probably, yeah."
02_MILE,"Talking about how Gregory Hines said, he doesn't realize a human being can't tap that fast."
02_JAMI,Right. Right...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,"And they were talking about how, he's teaching these classes."
02_PETE,Hm.
02_MILE,And I guess he really goes fast. And.
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,He k-.
02_JAMI,He doesn't explain anything precisely.
02_MILE,"He has to double it down to like one fifth speed or something, before they can g- pick it up-."
02_HARO,Well I'm sure Thomas is all over it.
02_JAMI,Probably <XX> <XX>.
02_HARO,I mean he has a bro-...
02_MILE,<XX> could have seen him.
02_HARO,I guess that means his broken leg is doing okay.
02_PETE,"I was wondering about that, I was imagining he had broke an arm or something."
02_JAMI,Oh yeah.
02_PETE,But it was his leg.
02_HARO,Yeah.
02_PETE,"That's like, I guess that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff."
02_HARO,Right. He healed very quickly.
02_JAMI,"Guess kids' bones, just like grow back really fast."
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_HARO,Yeah. I think they're really soft to start with.
02_JAMI,They're made of rubber. Th- that's it.
02_HARO,"That's why b-, little kids usually don't break their legs anyway."
02_PETE,Cause they're so <XX>.
02_JAMI,Cause they're made of rubber.
02_MILE,"But they have more cartilage than w-, you know."
02_HARO,"Yeah, aren't they real s-, aren't their k- legs pretty soft."
02_MILE,"Yeah, there's less calcium uh deposits in them. And also."
02_PETE,Mm.
02_MILE,"They're still growing. And the way bones grow is, you make cartilage, and then you deposit calcium in it."
02_HARO,"Oh, and then that turns into hard bone."
02_MILE,So that's why they always have more flexibility. Cause as they're growing.
02_PETE,Hm.
02_MILE,You're making cartilage. So it al-.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_MILE,"They always have that, until they reach adulthood, in which case."
02_HARO,They get old and cranky like the rest of us.
02_MILE,It stops...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Unhunh...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,And then they break.
02_JAMI,Old and rickety and brittle.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_HARO,"Mhm, uncoordinated and unflexible."
02_PETE,Right.
02_HARO,Stiff.
02_JAMI,Inflexible.
02_PETE,That too.
02_MILE,"What are you planning on doing with dancing, Harold. You were taking some classes last fall."
02_HARO,I'll take a few more... as a.
02_JAMI,You will.
02_HARO,"It turns out as a spouse, I get in free..."
02_PETE,Oh really.
02_HARO,So.
02_PETE,That's not bad.
02_JAMI,"To group classes, yeah."
02_PETE,Hm.
02_HARO,"So, I should do that."
02_MILE,Oh really.
02_JAMI,Mhm.
02_MILE,That's why you married her... ...
02_JAMI,Some benefit.
02_PETE,Mm.
02_JAMI,Hunh...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Mhm...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Better than nothing...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,"Oh, I cannot believe you said that..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,What a jerk you are...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,Aren't you guys gonna stick up for me... and beat up on him or something.
02_MILE,He's bigger than I am...
02_PETE,<XX>.
02_MILE,He's not bigger than you.
02_PETE,No.
02_HARO,But he's my...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,He's my friend.
02_PETE,Tha- that's right...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,You know who I'll stick up for...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,I stuck up for you today at that store.
02_HARO,That's true.
02_JAMI,You did. You made me get the.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_JAMI,Um.
02_PETE,That's right.
02_JAMI,The green scarf. That's right. He was my fashion consultant today.
02_PETE,Right...
02_MILE,Hm...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,I wasn't.
02_PETE,That's right.
02_JAMI,Well you-. I don't know.
02_HARO,"We were at this dumb store, and the clerk kept trying to keep us interested."
02_PETE,Hm.
02_HARO,While she was buying.
02_PETE,That's right...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Don't you wanna try on the men's clothes... <XX>.
02_JAMI,"I'm the one who suggested that, so you wouldn't be so bored..."
02_PETE,Well I-.
02_JAMI,"So they tried on the men's clothes, and they had a very small selection of men's clothes."
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_JAMI,"They try on these really great pants, and they look really good in them. Then they didn't buy em."
02_PETE,Right. Well.
02_JAMI,You know how boys are. They never buy clothes.
02_PETE,Broke...
02_JAMI,"Broke, Yeah. Students are are broke..."
02_PETE,Right...
02_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"Uh, is that that. Or is that a real."
02_JAMI,"Yeah, that's a tape. That's a tape."
02_MILE,Where's it coming from...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,The speaker over there.
02_HARO,The speakers. You know these boxes...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<XX>.
02_MILE,You must have good stereo. Cause I feel like I'm hearing.
02_HARO,We have uh. These are like.
02_JAMI,The world's worst speakers.
02_MILE,Where is the other one.
02_HARO,These are the shittiest speakers on earth.
02_JAMI,Over here...
02_PETE,<XX>.
02_JAMI,Besides the ones in the kitchen.
02_HARO,And these are an improvement over my last ones.
02_MILE,I thought that was the real thing.
02_HARO,You think we have like a jazz band next door.
02_MILE,In fact I was getting ready to say...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"Is there somebody downstairs, playing..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,I mean that was what I first thought-.
02_JAMI,It's our garage band.
02_PETE,"When when the jazz came on. As compared to the other stuff, for some reason it sounded like it was out there, or kind of coming in from some place."
02_JAMI,Unhunh.
02_HARO,Hm.
02_JAMI,Hunh.
02_HARO,Well that would be nice to have a little jazz band next door.
02_PETE,Right.
02_HARO,Wouldn't it.
02_JAMI,No.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_HARO,Usually we just have really loud salsa parties across the street.
02_JAMI,That's fun too. And teenagers... kissing each other on the sidewalk.
02_HARO,Hm.
02_PETE,Hm...
02_HARO,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,And little kids throwing paint in your backyard.
02_HARO,Yeah...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,And in the front yard-. You saw that <XX>.
02_PETE,"I saw that, right in the front."
02_HARO,But.
02_JAMI,"Well what is it, paint."
02_PETE,It was the same color or something.
02_HARO,It was like.
02_JAMI,Or is it chalk.
02_HARO,"Well I k-. I went out one morning, and I saw it all around, and it was like on the back bumper of the Honda, too."
02_PETE,Oh rude.
02_HARO,"So I thought oh shit, I'd better try to wipe that off, so I I got-, I went and got a wet rag and wiped it off the car. And it came off really easily. And then I saw there was like this tube of it."
02_JAMI,But it was paint.
02_HARO,This whole tube of it across the street.
02_JAMI,Those kids are just.
02_HARO,Sitting in the gutter. So I threw it away.
02_JAMI,And she's pregnant with another one. There gonna have another.
02_HARO,Which one is pregnant.
02_JAMI,Brat kid-.
02_HARO,The the the really fat red-haired woman.
02_JAMI,"The mother. The get over here you, nya nya nya nya nya nya nya."
02_HARO,Does she even have a b- a man-. I guess she must.
02_MILE,Does she have a what.
02_JAMI,A man.
02_HARO,A man...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,She has some kind of a.
02_MILE,At least temporarily.
02_PETE,Yeah.
02_HARO,Yeah.
02_JAMI,At one time.
02_HARO,"For about five minutes, probably..."
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,And they were banging their their soccer ball up against our... below the bedroom th- the study window.
02_HARO,So Jamie the old lady went and yelled at em.
02_JAMI,I opened uh.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_JAMI,"Ah, you mind moving, getting away from there, thank you. I felt like such an old lady..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,It's so bad.
02_JAMI,"With those kids, they make us feel so old."
02_PETE,How many of them are there.
02_HARO,Eight hundred.
02_PETE,Yow...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,There's two...
02_PETE,<XX>...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,"No, there's..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,"There's two young ones, and one who's like twelve."
02_HARO,"Oh, the cow."
02_JAMI,Who has friends.
02_PETE,Unhunh.
02_JAMI,The- the cow.
02_PETE,Hm.
02_JAMI,"The older cow, and then there's the middle cow, and there's a little young cow..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,The little baby cow.
02_JAMI,The butterball.
02_PETE,The calf.
02_HARO,Geezh- Zheezhee.
02_JAMI,The butter-.
02_PETE,Zheezhee the calf.
02_JAMI,The butterball...
02_HARO,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,"The butterball. They used to have this little butterball, r-... when we first moved in, he would, he'd be running around, d- in the street with his diapers on... this butterball of a kid."
02_HARO,And then he'd stop and go.
02_JAMI,"He'd wheeze, once he stopped running."
02_HARO,"Cause he's so fat, that whenever he runs, he gets really winded. And he's, you know, a year and a half yea- years old."
02_JAMI,Or two years old.
02_HARO,A year and a half old.
02_JAMI,A year and a half years old...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,Uh. They're terrible. Really.
02_HARO,I can't t-. How do you. She just looks pregnant... now.
02_JAMI,She's pregnant. She's totally pregnant.
02_HARO,Oh.
02_JAMI,"It's not eating too much, she's pregnant."
02_HARO,"So, I guess, I mean thi- this- thi- this just happened. Or."
02_JAMI,We're gonna have babies crying... in the middle of the night...
02_HARO,"Well it's no worse than her screaming at em, is it."
02_PETE,Yeah but now you'll have both.
02_JAMI,"Yeah right. Probably be like, shut up you ki-, you know, <XX>. Oh God. I feel. I s- feel like such an old lady. But I... they just really annoy me... kay."
02_MILE,Hunh.
02_JAMI,New subject.
02_PETE,Hm...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Well it's cause they have no respect.
02_JAMI,"Yeah, I guess so."
02_MILE,"Those two top masks, there."
02_HARO,Yep...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,We need a verb.
02_MILE,I guess the ones below are women...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Is that why they look so different...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Uh-oh.
02_MILE,"I mean, i-. Well you see their eyeballs, I guess."
02_PETE,Right. Yeah the other.
02_MILE,"In addition to a mustache and a beard. But the thing is, that second one looks like the guy who was in one of the Oba Oba skits."
02_JAMI,Do you know those... any of those dances.
02_PETE,All of em.
02_JAMI,All of em...
02_HARO,The little what.
02_MILE,"Looks like, the second."
02_PETE,Why.
02_MILE,One from the top looks like a guy who was in the Oba Oba k- skit.
02_HARO,What's an Oba Oba skit.
02_JAMI,"Oba Oba, oh the Brazilian troop that was here, dancing."
02_MILE,Yeah.
02_PETE,Oh yeah.
02_JAMI,I never saw that.
02_PETE,"Look like... uhuh a real-... an actual person doing it, or some kind of masks they had, or."
02_MILE,"No. Uh, the guy looked like that."
02_PETE,Or there's a guy looked like that...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Yeah...
02_PETE,That's pretty good...
02_MILE,<XX> Just like him...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,With the right.
02_MILE,I mean that looks kinda like a Black person.
02_HARO,"With red eyes, and everything."
02_MILE,"So where is this from. This isn't from Africa, is it."
02_HARO,No. From Indonesia.
02_MILE,Uh But that person looks Black.
02_PETE,Which one is it.
02_MILE,Or do Indonesian people look Black.
02_JAMI,Looks pink to me.
02_PETE,The-... which one. The.
02_MILE,I figure the second one from the top.
02_HARO,Tumenggung.
02_JAMI,The second from the top.
02_PETE,Tumenggung. Hunh.
02_MILE,"I look at that and think, yeah, that looks like a brother."
02_PETE,That's interesting...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Cause I think Indo- Indonesians.
02_JAMI,Think.
02_PETE,"Or, people who've been to Indonesia, think that those guys, like the two top ones, have really European characteristics... compared to Indonesians."
02_JAMI,Uh.
02_PETE,Just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big.
02_HARO,Their eyes are round.
02_JAMI,Oh really.
02_PETE,"And Indonesians have real thin eyes, and, and flat noses and stuff. I don't know."
02_HARO,"Except those, well, I don't know, the-... the bottom ones don't have flat noses either."
02_PETE,That's true they all have b-... they all have big noses. But they get bigger as you go up anyway.
02_HARO,What do you think makes em look African.
02_JAMI,Their mustaches.
02_HARO,Is it the uh... the way their little beard goes...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Oh no. That's not even relevant. I- d-. I just glanced at that.
02_PETE,Hunh.
02_MILE,And I immediately saw this guy's face in Oba Oba.
02_PETE,Yeah. Hunh. That's interesting.
02_MILE,He looks like that guy.
02_JAMI,Poor guy.
02_HARO,That is really interesting...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Yeah.
02_JAMI,Bulging eyes.
02_MILE,"Cause I remember, he came to Bahia after one of his shows one night... s kinda funny."
02_JAMI,Wow.
02_HARO,Well the top guy has a real thick lip.
02_MILE,Oh in his black leather jacket and his black.
02_PETE,Mm.
02_HARO,Klana has a real thick lip.
02_MILE,Hood hat.
02_PETE,Right...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Pretty bad overbite too.
02_MILE,He's in Oba Oba.
02_PETE,You know.
02_MILE,"Smoking, He didn't."
02_HARO,Yeah...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Then he tried to. He danced with a friend of mine.
02_JAMI,"Yeah, what happened."
02_MILE,"But she didn't wanna dance with him anymore, I said, boy, he just wanted to get close to me."
02_HARO,Oo.
02_JAMI,Oo.
02_PETE,Mm.
02_MILE,"I said, well, can't blame him."
02_HARO,Oba Oba...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,M yeah.
02_JAMI,Gross.
02_PETE,Mm.
02_MILE,"But I'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women. They travel all over the world. I'm sure a lot of women throw themselves at em, so that's what they expect from women."
02_HARO,A lot of groupies.
02_MILE,Yeah. Fringe benefits.
02_PETE,Hm...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,"The only fringe benefit of being a dancer, probably."
02_HARO,Well in San Francisco.
02_MILE,But then again.
02_HARO,"You never know if it's a benefit or not, either."
02_JAMI,That's true...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"I didn't know this, but apparently in Brazil, they have a very very high AIDS infection rate."
02_HARO,Really.
02_JAMI,Oh.
02_PETE,Oh.
02_JAMI,Probably <XX>.
02_MILE,It's supposed to be very high.
02_PETE,Mm.
02_HARO,You mean like.
02_JAMI,Very unmonitored.
02_HARO,Higher than the United State-.
02_JAMI,Too.
02_HARO,Higher than around here.
02_MILE,That's what I've heard.
02_PETE,Hm.
02_JAMI,I wouldn't be surprised.
02_HARO,"Have you heard these figures... that like, um, it's something like forty percent of males, in the Bay Area, are supposed to be infected."
02_MILE,"Well, last July."
02_PETE,Oh really...
02_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,This is what.
02_JAMI,"Of homosexual males, or of males."
02_PETE,Of all males.
02_HARO,Of males in general.
02_MILE,This infectious disease woman.
02_HARO,Or males under thirty I think it is.
02_MILE,At San Francisco General.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_MILE,"She said that, this doesn't seem like it can be true, but she said that, ninety per cent of gay men, are HIV positive, and fifty percent of all males, are HIV positive."
02_HARO,Yeah.
02_MILE,That's what she said.
02_HARO,"Fifty perc-. It was some. Like, a- m-... half or more than half of, and it was fairly young men, but, were, had been exposed to HIV virus. It wasn't necessarily that they were infected."
02_MILE,"Well, if you're HIV positive, it's the same difference."
02_HARO,Mhm.
02_MILE,"Since they feel that, sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease."
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,But that's what she said. Now I don't know if she meant the Bay area or San Francisco...
02_JAMI,<XX>.
02_MILE,"But those are some ferocious numbers, if one out of."
02_PETE,Yeah.
02_JAMI,That's just horrible.
02_MILE,"Two guys, you meet."
02_HARO,Yeah...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Cause there're a lot of women out there who apparently don't believe in using condoms.
02_PETE,Hm.
02_MILE,I'm just amazed...
02_JAMI,<XX> dumb move.
02_HARO,See I'd heard that it was mainly.
02_JAMI,Really dumb.
02_HARO,In t's mainly urban areas.
02_PETE,Yeah.
02_HARO,"That had this really disproportionately high propor-... um, percentage. And then like, r- rural areas, or, like, you know, central Iowa and stuff, had like ten percent or less, of the males, had been infected."
02_MILE,Well I would assume San Francisco is higher than most cities around the country.
02_HARO,Unhunh.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_MILE,"But, that just blew me away. Cause I'm thinking well gee, if half of all the men are HIV positive, what does that mean about the women they're having sex with."
02_PETE,Right. Yeah...
02_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Well.
02_MILE,"But, and just talking with guys..."
02_PETE,<XX> <XX>.
02_MILE,"In their twenties, why, I mean these guys, say these women don't care if they use rubbers or not. This is what guys have been telling me..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"You know, and I'm thinking, I- I can't believe that, cause in this city, with all the information available."
02_HARO,It seems like.
02_PETE,Right yeah.
02_JAMI,Stupid.
02_HARO,"People, people have the information they need."
02_MILE,"It is just amazing, that people in their twenties apparently aren't."
02_PETE,Right. That's really scary.
02_MILE,So I guess it's time for me to become a priest...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,It's too dangerous out there.
02_HARO,"Oh, I don't know."
02_MILE,I couldn't believe it. This woman I knew I was gonna ask out. God.
02_HARO,You have to be Catholic first.
02_MILE,"Her sister, who's an HIV counselor..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Was telling me how her sister just won't use rubbers... at all.
02_JAMI,Hm.
02_HARO,Well where would she put them.
02_MILE,And I'm thinking...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,I'm thinking.
02_JAMI,Well.
02_MILE,How can you not.
02_JAMI,My sisters don't.
02_MILE,"I mean, uh what are they thinking."
02_JAMI,I don't know.
02_HARO,Don't look at me.
02_MILE,"Uh I- I was just really amazed to hear that, people in their twenties."
02_JAMI,We're innocent.
02_MILE,Cause I figure.
02_JAMI,We don't have sex.
02_MILE,"Growing up around here, you would know better..."
02_HARO,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"And in high school, you know, they teach about it."
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_MILE,So.
02_JAMI,I don't know.
02_HARO,"Not only that, but they have really lewd billboards all over the Castro district..."
02_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,Something's wrong.
02_HARO,I know.
02_JAMI,I thought we got our electricity fixed.
02_HARO,That's kind of scary...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,"I thought I turned this off, though."
02_PETE,It's been doing.
02_HARO,Didn't I.
02_PETE,"Oh, that's right."
02_JAMI,But.
02_PETE,You did. That's really scary then.
02_MILE,"This is salsa, right."
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,What what. Who is this.
02_JAMI,"I don't know, it's from the radio station years ago when I was in Santa Cruz."
02_MILE,"You know on Sundays, at ten o'clock."
02_JAMI,That's right now.
02_MILE,"Kay, what is that. Kay, oh I don't know what the radio station is."
02_JAMI,They play Salsa.
02_HARO,It begins with a kay though.
02_MILE,"No, they played this..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,They have a Brazilian jazz hour. Is there a KKSF. I don't know what it was. But it was like I went to Bahia.
02_JAMI,What's.
02_MILE,"Last Sunday, got there at eight, left a ten, dropped this person off at home, in Foster City, and came back, and I <XX>- was noticing, the songs they were playing on the radio, were the exact same songs they were singing at Bahia, the- b- live band there."
02_JAMI,"Hm, should I turn on the radio statio-. You don't know what station it was on."
02_MILE,"I- I was. KKSF, does that mean anything to you."
02_HARO,Nope. You have to translate it to a number.
02_MILE,"I was in a rental car, so it was just whatever station it was on."
02_JAMI,Mm...
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,Hm.
02_MILE,"But uh, I was just remembering being surprised, cause, I didn't realize, I don't know anything about Brazilian music. You go to the- Brazilian club, and they're singing songs, apparently I guess that's the popular stuff. I guess. I'm so used to hearing those songs, cause I've heard em for the past three months, I didn't think anything of it, but then, this guy played songs for a whole hour, and it was like, eighty per cent of those songs I'd... that band had sung that very night."
02_JAMI,Mhm... Pickup band's pretty good there. Viva.
02_MILE,Well they have a different band every night.
02_JAMI,"Who was it, Viva Brazil. Oh, I went on the-..."
02_MILE,<XX>.
02_JAMI,"Friday night, so maybe it was different band."
02_MILE,Um when did you do that...
02_JAMI,"Oh, a while ago. The dance floor's too small in that place though. It's really annoying. I like this song."
02_MILE,"Are they teaching any more lambada, at uh."
02_JAMI,School.
02_MILE,Yeah.
02_HARO,Vivian was giving a lambada lesson.
02_MILE,Cause uh.
02_HARO,When I was there the other day.
02_MILE,"Well, my lambada's definitely getting better."
02_JAMI,Really. Really. I wanna go out lambada dancing with you... <XX>.
02_MILE,"I mean I'm gonna start dancing with those Brazilian women. So I can learn how to beat my hips, I mean, cause their their hips are beating up against you, you know, like that fast... <XX>. Hundred cycles per second, or something..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"I mean, I am not kidding. It. It is a different sensation entirely..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,When you're dancing with them.
02_HARO,I bet...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,And the-... uh only way to learn how is to dance with them more.
02_JAMI,That's true.
02_MILE,But I feel like I can start dancing with them now. But uh.
02_JAMI,"No th-. I don't. I don't. They haven't done anything recently, I, I can't remember if they're going to."
02_MILE,"Cause, like, Sue Swing taught that class for two months, May and June, and uh."
02_JAMI,Is she a good lambada dancer. I can't imagine her being a.
02_MILE,"Yeah but, I didn't feel like she taught it any different... significantly differently than when Vivian and Jeff taught it. I mean, cause they do it."
02_JAMI,"Real basic, and real simple."
02_MILE,"Different, than Brazilians do it."
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,"I mean, I don't know what those Brazilian women are doing."
02_JAMI,What are they doing.
02_MILE,But their hips are like.
02_JAMI,"Are they going... are they going like, really fast. I mean are they going one two three."
02_MILE,I mean.
02_JAMI,One two three.
02_MILE,"First you had this wide sway of their hips this way, and then, it's like, they're coming, I mean, they're beating me like this. I don't even know how you can do that. You're dancing with them, they're beating you just like this..."
02_HARO,Using their hands like that...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"No, using their pelvic bones."
02_HARO,Wow.
02_PETE,Mm.
02_JAMI,Right here.
02_MILE,Yeah.
02_PETE,Sort of like Tahitian dancers or something.
02_HARO,Yeah.
02_PETE,"You know, close."
02_MILE,But I tell you...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"But anyway, you know, they weren't teaching it that way..."
02_HARO,<XX> <XX>.
02_MILE,"You know, the ballroom people don't do it that way..."
02_PETE,<XX> <XX>.
02_MILE,But that's what I want to learn.
02_JAMI,"Don't-. Don't they teach, don't they teach you to go, one two three, one two three, one two three, like that. Or do they go like really fast like that."
02_MILE,"Well Sue Swing, I mean when she was teaching was definitely more sedate, and the same thing with Jeff and Vivian."
02_JAMI,"Viv-, Yeah."
02_MILE,It was just Jeff and.
02_JAMI,"Sure, but that's cause it's for s-... it's for people who can't move their hips. Right. I mean it's for basic, you know, this is a beginning lambada class, or intermediate <XX>."
02_MILE,"I don't know why they did it that way. I mean, it seems to me if they're gonna teach it like what you do, uh."
02_JAMI,"Or what they teach, and what happens socially, could be two different things. You know."
02_MILE,"I mean, Brazilians definitely don't, hm, do it like that."
02_JAMI,"I should. I want to go. I should check it out. I like that, cause it's fun... <XX> <XX>."
02_MILE,I mean after I f-. I mean I.
02_JAMI,Are you. Do they still teach at Bahia on Sunday... night.
02_MILE,"Oh yeah. In fact I would have gone today, if it wasn't for my back..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Well I finally found some people there I can dance with. So that helps.
02_JAMI,Do you need a partner.
02_MILE,To go there.
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,"No. Besides, you, I mean if you're a guy, If. If you're a woman, I mean, those guys'll be all over you. I swear it..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,Don't say that.
02_HARO,Run along now.
02_JAMI,Harold's in the room.
02_HARO,Dear...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,You could come too.
02_MILE,"Well I don't necessarily mean, uh in a bad way, even though I'm sure there are a few there, uh uh I'm not dancing with guys. All I can say is, the women aren't all over me. Darn."
02_HARO,Oo.
02_MILE,But...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"But I remember, like I went there with this person, it's kind of funny... th- this person did not want to dance. So she's just gonna watch. So, every once in a while I'd get up and dance, and it's like, when I'd come back, I mean there was some guy there, sitting in my chair..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"Every time I got up. I'm thinking, God, these guys don't waste any time. I mean, you turn your back, and there's somebody moving in..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,I mean I don't know if they <XX> <XX>.
02_JAMI,Maybe Harold you should come with me.
02_HARO,Why. So I can find.
02_JAMI,Learn some lam- lambada...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Find some girls with empty chairs next to em...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,Maybe I should go with Miles.
02_MILE,Oh did- uh...
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,"Yeah, you guys could be partners."
02_MILE,Did-.
02_JAMI,What.
02_MILE,"Well I don't know if I told you, uh told you that story about that woman, who uh, went after that guy there. I told you that story, right. I was there Sunday three four weeks ago. Uh, after the class is over w-... over with, I'm sitting down at a table, there's a woman from... who was in the class, and two men, sitting to my right, is a table with two women there. They had apparently just come from Oba Oba... on the last night."
02_JAMI,Oh I think you told me.
02_MILE,The last night.
02_JAMI,Yeah.
02_MILE,"And like, well they were attractive women, the one had on a real real short skirt. Anyway, there was this guy in his fifties, out there dancing, by himself. And the woman was just looking at him, making eyes, then she went out there, got on her knees... in front of him... in this skirt that's this short, takes her hands, and goes along his toes, and then up, and is just doing like that. I figured."
02_JAMI,Oo.
02_MILE,"Oh, they must know each other."
02_JAMI,Oo.
02_HARO,"Very well, in fact."
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_JAMI,Gross.
02_MILE,"That's what I assumed. And, they did that for the whole dance, and I mean, she was d- all kind of suggestive stuff, and touching him and everything, people would like cheering, and clapping, go for it. And all this kind of thing. The- the song ended, the guy set down, at another table. And she set down."
02_JAMI,At a-.
02_MILE,At the table with her woman friend. They never danced again the rest of the evening.
02_HARO,Hm.
02_MILE,This is like...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"So I was thinking, this woman's sitting about as far away from me as Jamie is. And I was thinking, hm, this is interesting. I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her. No sooner did I think this thought, guys were over there."
02_HARO,"What-, you didn't ask her to dance."
02_JAMI,"Not Miles, he's just in daze."
02_MILE,Well I was still trying to figure out...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"Surely they must know each other, I mean, why wasn't he sitting at her table."
02_JAMI,"You mean, you werestill thinking about it..."
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"Anyway, this guy..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"Uh uh I mean he comes over there, immediately afterwards."
02_JAMI,The same guy who got his... the same guy who's.
02_HARO,"No, it's just some random guy."
02_JAMI,Or just some random guy.
02_MILE,"No, a random guy... who was like sitting about where you are."
02_HARO,Yeah.
02_MILE,"He was sitting there, there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are. And then these two women are sitting here. So uh, he comes over there, and is talking with that woman. I don't know about what, but then like ten minutes later, she and her friend are over at their table. And then, twenty minutes later, they were kinda like all over each other. You know... kissing, et cetera, et cetera. And I was thinking, it looks like, these people aren't going home alone tonight..."
02_HARO,Gosh.
02_MILE,But I just thought that.
02_HARO,No wonder they forbid this dance...
02_MILE,So.
02_JAMI,"Oh my God, what a story. Well, maybe I shouldn't go there then."
02_HARO,"Yeah, maybe you shouldn't."
02_MILE,It- it- it was interesting.
02_JAMI,"No, I went there before, it was fine... it was really fun."
02_HARO,You were there before.
02_JAMI,Yeah. I went out there before.
02_HARO,Oh.
02_PETE,Without even telling Harold.
02_HARO,Without telling me.
02_JAMI,Uhuh You knew. If I was going out dancing.
02_HARO,Oh. Oh. I did.
02_JAMI,Remember a few months ago I used to go out dancing... every now and then.
02_HARO,"Hm-m, I don't remember."
02_MILE,"Well the thing that gets me, I meet this."
02_JAMI,"To Caesar's, and stuff."
02_MILE,"I meet this psychotherapist... who tells me she's addicted to this dance... which I th-... think is a interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use. But uh, she's married, and apparently she's there without her husband. She has her wedding ring on. And it's like she's with this guy, and they're kinda like all over each other. And I'm thinking, well, I guess that's her husband."
02_JAMI,Uh-oh did you say something.
02_MILE,But I-...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"But I was thinking, but the thing is, you know she's kind of all sophisticated and everything, and I'm thinking, you know, this guy uh, uh I can't really believe that guy's her husband. So I don't know what's going on here. And of course later on I find out, that's not her husband. So, I'm thinking, you know, I don't know what's going on here... But uh, uh, bizarre."
02_JAMI,Gossip.
02_MILE,"But then she tells me, gee I don't know what it is about this guy I mean, I've been trying to tell him I don't want a sexual relationship with him, and I'm thinking, from the way they look, when I'd seen them three weeks before, it looked to me like they had one... I'm thinking, you don't do that with-."
02_JAMI,So. This is all at Bahia.
02_MILE,Strangers.
02_JAMI,All this stuff happens at Bahia.
02_MILE,Yeah.
02_JAMI,Hunh.
02_MILE,To other people I mean...
02_JAMI,Well...
02_MILE,<XX>.
02_JAMI,I mean maybe.
02_HARO,That was actually very profound.
02_JAMI,"Yeah, that was... Maybe you can just go up to a woman, and, you know, do that kinda thing."
02_HARO,Yeah. You. You wind up getting punched.
02_PETE,Mhm.
02_HARO,Is what'll happen...
02_JAMI,"Probably, something'll land in your mouth."
02_PETE,"Well, it sounds like there you wouldn't be though..."
02_JAMI,What.
02_MILE,"Yeah, right..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,"I really, was wondering what that guy was thinking. He must have been... j- since he didn't know her, that must have been quite a shock."
02_JAMI,That was really weird. That sounds really weird.
02_MILE,"I mean, you're... y- y- fifty year old guy, and, some twenty-year-old woman comes up doing that to you, uh, what do you think..."
02_HARO,"I think you think, you better go back to your table, fast."
02_PETE,Right.
02_HARO,Apparently...
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_HARO,"I'll f- I'll tell you when I'm fifty what you think, okay..."
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,<NONVERBAL>
02_JAMI,<NONVERBAL>
02_MILE,Mhm.
02_HARO,What.
02_JAMI,That'll be weird when you're fifty. Wonder what you'll look like.
02_HARO,"Nobody's fifty, don't worry about it."
02_JAMI,"Oh, okay. Ha ha ha, la lala lala..."
02_MILE,"Oh well, ten o'clock. Look like it's bedtime for some folks here."
02_HARO,Yep.
02_JAMI,"Yeah, actually it's pretty much bed time for me soon."
02_PETE,Hm.
02_HARO,Yep.
02_MILE,Well that was good ice cream. What kind of ice cream was that.
02_HARO,Bud's.
02_JAMI,Pralines and cream-. What is it called.
02_MILE,But what flavor.
02_HARO,"Uh, pecan praline."
02_PETE,Praline-.
02_JAMI,P-.
02_HARO,Or something like that.
02_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
