60_ALAN,"I got a story to tell you, it's a shaggy dog story, but as long as we're talking about that recorder and six-hundred dollars, I'll tell you the story, oh gosh, uh, Rae and I and Sue and Buddy, took a trip, to Mexico City..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"It must've been, four to six months after my dad died. That's how I remember it, he died in sixty-s-."
60_JON,Oh God.
60_ALAN,"December sixty-seven, so, sometime in sixty-eight we took this trip, we'd been talking about it for a while, uh, flew down to Mexico City, uh we, c- think of the name of my hotel, which wouldn't mean anything now, but we ended up in a fabulous hotel, uh, first night, we were very unhappy with our rooms, we got down there, and the next morning, Buddy, who's a early riser anyhow, was probably up four o'clock, and he went down there complaining to the manager, So, cause it was not w- the accommodation we were supposed to have had, we checked in about eight o'clock at night or so, which is, in Mexico is like, you know, the. Well we ended up with a corner suite. With, It was so big..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"We could've had a party for fifty people <XX>. Three bathrooms in it, uh two bedrooms, so they had, but they had an extra guest bathroom <XX>, big bar, it was circ-, open on two sides, of course we didn't have anybody there but the two of us, And I remember the New York Yankees were training there. So it probably was, the season opens in April, so it probably was February or March, Mickey Mantle, and uh Whitey Ford and all of em, I wish I'd been smart enough to know then that uh, these baseball cards, and those autographs, would be selling for, three or four hundred dollars..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"But, at any rate, uh, I went down there with a recorder. We used to. We had those things at the store, that we used to use, when we'd go out of town and..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"Particularly if we were looking at some site, or, we were looking at a store..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"When we had some comments, we'd talk into those things. We had four or five of em, Aaron had one, I had one, Mike had one, <XX> had one, from that financial guy, Things sold at the time for about eight or nine-hundred dollars."
60_JON,Eight or nine-hundred.
60_ALAN,Eight-. Eight or nine-hundred dollars...
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"Uh, you got a very sophisticated one, but you know the little ones now about this size. Well this son of a bitch weighed about fifteen pounds. It was some heavy son of a bitch..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"Had a pouch, like, sorta like you've got. I carried it around. Well any rate, my wife had fallen in love, with a, Mexican artist by the name of Nierman. Forgot his first name. Jewish guy."
60_JON,Mm.
60_ALAN,"Mexican national. His paintings sold, f- for generally, a thousand dollars plus. Which was, for me."
60_JON,A lotta money in those days.
60_ALAN,"Twenty-five years ago, I was... no way I was gonna spend twe- a thou-. First of all I didn't like him. Very splashy. Albert and Marcia had one of his paintings, they had. They had. I I don't know, Marcia had a relative in Mexico, or something. But they'd been down there. Many times and, and they had his book, and, we got down there, and he was, uh, all over the place. His paintings were, he lived in Mexico City. And uh..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"We had a cab driver. Uh, that was gonna take us to, wherever the place where the gold was. I can't remember, one of the roughest rides, and if you ever been to Mexico City, you made that ride."
60_JON,Yeah.
60_ALAN,"Some kinda city, about hundred miles away, I thought we were gonna die going down there. An old car and, anyway. Well before that, he took us around the city, still got his card somewhere. Slammed the damn door on this guy, poor guy's hand one day, inadvertently, we were getting out, we had him about three days, one day we took him down to wherever we went, Buddy and Sue didn't go, but he took us to the ruins, and all that stuff. You know, uh, you know, I and I I knew then, and I know now, that those guys, take you to a particular place, they get a commission. Well, they took us to this guy's studio."
60_JON,He what.
60_ALAN,"Took us to this guy- artist's studio. Uh, and uh, Rae, he was there. And she saw a painting she liked. And, uh, he wanted that damn recorder. And he said I tell you what I'll do... <XX> make you a deal. He said I'll. You take this painting, I want that recorder. I'll take it. Could-... naw I can't do that, it's not mine. It was. It's about a thousand dollar swap. Shit I thought my wife was gonna have a fit..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"She was pissed off, Mexico City was a, uh in those days, probably still is, not. For this guy he was very successful. Uh, very prolific. But it was an art colony, and there were a lot of Americans down there. He was not an American. A lot of Americans down there, uh because, cost of living was so cheap at the time. And they- they had these art shows everywhere. Well we bought a painting, uh, of a little Mexican woman, still got it, with a watermelon on her head, like it a lot. Think I paid thirty dollars for it. Well that was about my price range. Uh, while I was down there, we may have bought a couple of other i- inexpensive paintings, maybe collectively we bought, maybe spent a hundred and fifty dollars. Uh, hell I was not an art. We weren't art collectors. And uh, to spend a thousand dollars, to me for a painting, was unthinkable. Uh, The s- first painting I ever bought, my father-in-law bought it from Geri f-, Geri Rae, it was one of Geri's original early early paintings, which I thoroughly enjoy, she's changed styles but, While we were down there, uh."
60_JON,You know I.
60_ALAN,This. It.
60_JON,I've seen that somewhere before.
60_ALAN,"You know I've had that painting for thirty-five years I guess. I- I've never framed it. And I really like it. Uh, my. My my father-in-law wanted to give me a painting for my. Piece of art for my office. And so I had a. We had a display guy at the time, by the name of Ben Money, fashioned himself as an artist. And I said Ben, pick me out something. You've got fifty bucks to spend. So, he got this from Geri, and I loved it... <XX>."
60_JON,It's beautiful.
60_ALAN,"And and, I can see all kinda things in it."
60_JON,It's got a lotta color and.
60_ALAN,"Lotta color. I see a Chinese junk, At any rate, to make a long s-. This fellow LeRoy Neiman, over here. Sports artist. Not the same guy, as this guy Nierman. I've forgotten his name."
60_JON,Oh I thought there was a connection.
60_ALAN,"No. No connection. K- there is a connection on the story, Well, we looked at a lot of art, in in in the, in the, uh parks, and there at least it was, pleasant weather and, Like that uh, It was sorta like, uh, What the hell they call the district in New York, where on Sunday, they put all the artists, put their paintings out, uh, the Village, the Village."
60_JON,The Village.
60_ALAN,"You know all the all these artists put their. Well they had, must've had three areas like that. Parks with paintings, and my god, there must've been thousands of paintings. And uh, most of em, very inexpensive. Uh starving artists that were down there, lots of American..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"Well, uh, we wandered around down in the, the area which, I've forgotten the area that they called, in Mexico City where, uh, most of the jewelry shops are and things. It's got a name. I can't remember, I've never been back. They also had a lot of, uh, artist galleries down there. And I walked into this gallery, during one of our. We were down there maybe ten days. And I saw this guy Nierman. I never heard of him, at that time. He he he got famous at the nineteen, uh, probably seventy-two Olympics. Uh, but his c-. His art was already in collections of guys like Edward gee Robinson, it was very popular in Hollywood. He also was very prolific. Big handlebar mustache. And I walked in, and there must have been about, twelve or fifteen paintings in there. They were, uh."
60_JON,"You walked into his studio, or."
60_ALAN,"It was a gallery. Uh, he didn't live there... he didn't live in Mexico."
60_JON,Okay.
60_ALAN,"The oth- th-. The guy n-. Th- the Jewish fellow, they're both Jewish."
60_JON,Okay.
60_ALAN,"Th- th- this guy Nierman, who was a Mexican national, lived there."
60_JON,Okay.
60_ALAN,"Forgotten his first name. Leonardo Nierman or something. But any rate, but uh, uh this guy's name was LeRoy Neiman, I'd never heard of him, well I'd heard of Nierman. Uh, because Rae went down there wanting to buy one of those paintings. These were paintings, which I'd say were about the size of this Joe Namath... there. Which is a seriograph. And, uh we went in, and uh, they were just back from Acapulco, season was just over in Acapulco. And he had about fifteen twenty paintings, twenty-five paintings, football players, horse races, that's what he did, they were about that size. I'd been in there, oh God I looked at em, they just struck me as something, I loved em. They were great. They were you know very. Had a very distinctive style. And, uh, the guy said uh, God you've been in here, so many times that, said I'll make you a deal. You pick out any four of these you want, I'll give em to you for five-hundred dollars. The four of em. Shit, I loved those things. I stewed on those son of bitches, stewed on those son of bitches, I figured, I bought those fucking paintings, I'd have to buy that damn thing for Rae..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"Or, I'd trade that camera for a thousand dollars, and nine-hundred dollars to buy another one, I promise you as God is my witness. This guy's originals sell for a hundred thousand dollars apiece or more."
60_JON,You are kidding.
60_ALAN,"They were. He is, big, big, He's the premiere sports artist in the world."
60_JON,Really.
60_ALAN,"And uh, I'd never heard of him. And, but of course the price was right for me, but I didn't buy em. That was about-. That was about nineteen. Spring of sixty-eight. And I was watching the Olympics, of nineteen-seventy-two. And he'd been engaged by the Olympic committee. Uh he was prominent then, but not world famous..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"And uh, I. He was up all over. He's got a great big bull of. Bull Moose moustache sort of a deal, General Bull Moose if you remember."
60_JON,Yep.
60_ALAN,"And uh, his art was so distinctive. And he's. The sketching. I said Jesus. That's my man. I remember seeing at the Olympics. I hollered and screamed, and I told the story, Well of course, since that time, I'm on his mailing list, <XX> <XX> <XX> <XX>, one main gallery in New York, that uh, think distributes for him around the United States, and I'm on the mailing list, and they get today, twenty-five hundred to twenty-seven-fifty for a seriograph. Of which he produces maybe three to five-hundred of em. Depending on the issue. But these were originals. I-. Jon I promise you as God as my witness. I. He was. I could've walked away with those things and. And uh, I I I p-... uh uh. But that's my story on that machine. That damn thing, and of course, I didn't know-, Obviously I didn't know what I was missing, if I'd done I'd done that..."
60_JON,Obviously.
60_ALAN,But you know...
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,It was.
60_JON,But still five-hundred dollars was a lot of money in those-.
60_ALAN,Uh Five-hundred dollars was.
60_JON,You didn't spend that much on the whole trip probably.
60_ALAN,"Oh hell I w- I, you know I w- I, I would s- I would say probably, certainly we didn't spend five-hundred dollars for, uh, for, novelties and things of that nature, you know it was. You tal- you talking about a long time ago. Mexico City was cheap. Jesus Christ."
60_JON,Oh man it was.
60_ALAN,"I mean, We we we stayed in a first rate, I guess what you call today a four star hotel but, hell, I don't imagine we paid, twenty dollars, twenty-five dollars a night. You know <XX> uh uh."
60_JON,Probably. Probably.
60_ALAN,"But uh, anyhow, uh I I I. God I my. I give my wife the story, Every once in a while this guy's name. Cause uh I I I I I like this guy, love him. Uh, and of course, you know I've never, uh, <XX>, This one over here on the right, although it's signed by, by n-, Nier-. By, by LeRoy Neiman, Paul <XX>, and a uh, And is also signed by the artist, it was done for a, uh."
60_JON,Poster.
60_ALAN,"A benefit, it was a poster. That's just, That's not a, that's not what they call a seriograph, the Joe N-, the Joe uh Namath, Who was of course an Alabama football player."
60_JON,Yeah. Yeah.
60_ALAN,"Is, I saw it out in San Francisco, and my, my my in-laws bought that for me, uh, but uh, uh."
60_JON,It's a beauty though.
60_ALAN,"That's my, That th- that's my r-, That's my, my experience with one of those machines. I didn't have enough judgment to, to trade him that fucking machine."
60_JON,To give him the machine...
60_ALAN,"Because I'd say probably it wasn't, Like it was like computers. Well in a year or so after that, that thing was so impractical. Cause it was s-, heavy heavy heavy. You-, uh and."
60_JON,Well they're-... it's like you say I...
60_ALAN,<XX>.
60_JON,Eloise gave me one for Christmas about...
60_ALAN,"<XX>, This big. You know, and you buy one for, sixty dollars. Eighty dollars. I got one, I bought from Radio Shack. It's."
60_JON,Well did Rae ever get uh Nierman...
60_ALAN,"<XX>, No. Never did get it. But she nudged me when she got back, but of course, I guess, I haven't done it recently, but over the years I like to tell her this story..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"Tonight, because I haven't thought about it in a long time, And she'll say to me, I told you to get em..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"I told you. I must've gone into the place five times. You know, I'd go in there..."
60_JON,<XX>.
60_ALAN,And your mouth is just watering. Shit. If I buy those.
60_JON,But you knew you were gonna have to buy her w-.
60_ALAN,"Well if I had to. If I bought those things, Shit I'd have to buy her that damn thing."
60_JON,"Oh, ain't no question."
60_ALAN,"And there was no question about that, there wouldn't've been any liv-. Wouldn't been any living with her. You know, it's uh, y- y-, You know, h- I. I've gotten a lot better. But in those days, you know, hell I was, uh, maybe, I was, s- see. Sixty-eight, seventy-eight eighty-eight, <XX>. Just twenty-seven twenty-eight years ago. I was thirty-eight thirty-nine years old. And uh, I, I sure didn't have... uh I sure wasn't prosperous. I had my damn trip budgeted. And uh, to have gone out there and spent, another fifteen-hundred to two-thousand dollars for artwork, you know, my mother, who was you know strong as moose meat, come back, if she'd've known..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,She'd've figured I needed my fucking head examined...
60_JON,She'd've deducted it...
60_ALAN,Shit.
60_JON,Oh.
60_ALAN,Any rate uh.
60_JON,That's a good story though.
60_ALAN,Ah it's true story.
60_JON,Good story.
60_ALAN,True story. It was a true story. I I.
60_JON,Well it would've cost you that to replace the doggone machine.
60_ALAN,"Aw I'd've had to replace it for the store, uh, but as I said it was only a matter of, I guess a year, those things were really antiquated-. Although we used em a lot. Uh, in those days, and I, you know I recorded the whole trip, and uh, you know things that we did, It was a wonderful trip, we had good times."
60_JON,Better than keeping a diary.
60_ALAN,Oh yeah. A lot easier. It really is. Uh.
60_JON,We.
60_ALAN,I keep a.
60_JON,"Remember we tried keeping a diary on the China trip, and man it was arduous."
60_ALAN,"Well, I keep a diary-... course I we we haven't traveled much lately, I keep a diary, when I, go out of the country. Still got em in here. Otherwise, my problem is, and it's a lot easier to do it that way, but I, I keep I diary when I go out of the country..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"The problem is, uh with me, not that it comes up too much, but someone'll say something to me about somewhere I s-, Shit, I I, you know I, I forgot where I went. I have to look, cause I can't remember."
60_JON,"Well you go to so many places, on a cruise particularly, you know."
60_ALAN,Yeah.
60_JON,"So many places in a short time, that you get em mixed up. Now we can't even keep our photos straight without the diary."
60_ALAN,"Oh yeah. Well you know, y- when you get back from your trip, until you make another trip, you can remember. But, having taken as many trips as you've taken, shit, they sorta run together. I'm talking about."
60_JON,They do.
60_ALAN,The ones that were five years ago.
60_JON,Honest they do.
60_ALAN,"To separate the trip that you went on this one f-. It's tough to do. And uh, but, they're a lot... that's a lot easier than a diary, then you can transcribe it. But uh, I don't take, I don't take my diary in the domestic United States, and we haven't traveled all that much, but I have taken em, uh, first trip I made, uh you know, o- out, <XX>, In nineteen-seventy-six... <XX>. Tha-. Outside of Mexico, out of the country, was I went to, Uh we went to, I went to the Orient. On a business trip... <XX> exploratory trip, I was there for fifteen days, worked my ass off. But it was uh, went to uh, Japan, went to Osaka, which was the textile city, and then uh, Taipei and Hong Kong. Uh, and it was a, You've been. Um but it was for me, uh, uh not only an education, we'd been doing some importing, but uh through, a group. And it was a group of us that went. I guess it probably was, a dozen in our group that went. There was a group of stores that we were associated with, it was a a an interesting trip, uh, uh very educational. Uh, still got my notes from nineteen-seventy-six but, s- and all those god damn cards, you know how they get over there, everybody gives you..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,Gives you.
60_JON,Yeah.
60_ALAN,"Gives you a card. I'll never forget how impressed I was with, of all the Orientals, the Japanese are so bright. My god. And uh just uh, uh uh."
60_JON,Catch on like that.
60_ALAN,They jus-.
60_JON,Don't they.
60_ALAN,Oh. They really they... they really they real- they really.
60_JON,"They work at though man, and the Chinese work at it. They're good students, You know."
60_ALAN,"Well yeah... well, you know, we see."
60_JON,"Listen, look at these people from India. What s- good students they are. Some of your fine doctors."
60_ALAN,It's amazing ain't it.
60_JON,Yeah.
60_ALAN,"You know we see these people, you know y-. You know we've talked about this, on groups for years, all the problems we got with the Blacks, I was just reading an article, I believe it was the paper this morning. Where I read it. Maybe it was New York Times yesterday. Thirty-three percent, of the Black juveniles in their twenties, are either in jail..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,"On parole, or just released. Thirty-three percent. And then I, I read in another art-."
60_JON,And that doesn't count how many got away.
60_ALAN,"Oh that's right. But that's of the... uh in their twenties. I read an article, within the last three or four months, and I'm, I believe I'm correct on this figure that, twelve percent of the Black male population of the United States is in prison. Twelve per cent. Of the Black male population. As you say, how many di-. You know, how many oughta be in jail, probably that many more. But the point I was gonna make is, and there're always exceptions. Uh not to take anything away from uh, Percy Jones. Whose article I read this morning... because I mean he's, I don't know, what his family had, but I mean he's, you know he's, he's c- he's he's, come out of it. But, by and large across the board, uh, they've just never educated themselves. Coming from these backgrounds."
60_JON,Well that's the hard part.
60_ALAN,And and yet you s-.
60_JON,They haven't educated themselves.
60_ALAN,"And you see these people come here from Taiwan, Korea, Cambodia, Taipei, parents can't speak English, they come over not speaking English, and they, they excel scholastically, in the most difficult subjects. I mean chemistry, physics, medicine. I remember one year, there for at the time I remember reading the article, it's been ten or twelve years ago, but fourteen, were. Fourteen, uh public and private high schools in Shreveport-Bos. I don't know how many there are today. I remember that, it was a big article, that five valedictorians. For sh just Shreveport-Bossier. Five valedictorians that year were of Oriental descent. You know, couldn't've been at that time..."
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,Two hundred and fifty families in the whole damn area.
60_JON,No.
60_ALAN,Uh...
60_JON,<NONVERBAL>
60_ALAN,You know and you think.
60_JON,You know um.
60_ALAN,"And you think about the Jews, the Irish, and the Blacks, and it's the same all over the fucking world."
60_JON,Mm.
60_ALAN,"And I just read an article in New York Times. Yesterday. I clipped it. For my wife to read. Uh, about the fact that, in Israel, where they have brought in, thirty-thousand, where do the dark ones come from."
60_JON,Ethiopia.
60_ALAN,"Ethiopia. Uh, and five-hundred-thousand Russians. Ha- very proud of the fact that they've been able to do this, in a country of five million people. Uh, which, would devastate most countries. I mean they, uh."
60_JON,It's ten percent.
60_ALAN,"The, and and the, the Ethiopians in particular, had a big march last week. Because they're second-class citizens. The Jews look down on them too. You know they got a, they got a, they got a, uh, a class situation, they look different, they. And. Course they haven't accepted the Russians too well either. Uuh, although the, the the Russians, a high percentage of Russians are, according to this article, uh are scientists, doctors, engineers, mathematicians, and they."
60_JON,Ed- educated the difficult way.
60_ALAN,"On areas score, score higher on the test than the, than the th- the native-borns, but there's a big, you know there's a, the- the- there's a, there's a there's a class differential. Which was interesting. I I really, hadn't thought about it in many years, how those Blacks, uh had integrated into the ci- society. I am told, I haven't seen any of em, but the Blacks, th- they're not like our Blacks... they're."
60_JON,No no.
60_ALAN,"Small, you know smaller features, but uh, they are dark skinned, and uh, they look different <XX>. And uh, I don't know whether there are any other Black Jews over there, but uh, <XX>... <XX>."
60_JON,"A lot from South Africa, but they're well-educated people down there. A lot of em."
60_ALAN,A lot of Jews from South Afri-.
60_JON,Oh yeah.
60_ALAN,"I'm s-. I know that this fellow Goldstone, who was a head of this uh international war tri- crimes tribunal, is a Jewish fellow, because there was a picture of him in the paper with a yammaka on."
60_JON,Mm...
60_ALAN,You had to look close <XX>.
60_JON,Pretty good indication.
60_ALAN,Pretty good indication.
60_JON,Well you know.
60_ALAN,But uh.
60_JON,"These uh. These uh. What astounds me is, and this goes back into nineteen, let's see Duna, died in seventy-seven or something, so this, this goes back, oh further than that, maybe nineteen-seventy... in uh... NA"
