04_DOG,<NONVERBAL>

04_SHA,"They, they'll come, and they'll take their kids off..."
04_DOG,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"You know, half way through school to Mexico, and never come back. And they would. Like, I have couple parents, who still, I keep s- sending messages home with their folks, saying, please, you know, in Spanish, call the oficina, you need to fill out this form, because your kid..."
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"Can't have free lunch. Like for my first week there, I had, like, five dollars to my name, or something like that. I gave it all to the kids... all week long."
04_CARO,Mm.
04_SHA,Because their parents.
04_CARO,Big mistake.
04_SHA,"Were too lazy to come... and, and fill out the stupid form, you know, an application."
04_SHAN,That takes two weeks to process...
04_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"Yeah, that takes two weeks to process. I mean, how do you explain that to th-."
04_KATH,"Yeah but, is the form in English."
04_SHA,They have a form in Spanish also.
04_KATH,"Well, even if it's in Spanish, maybe they can't read."
04_SHA,Well.
04_SHAN,Yeah.
04_CARO,Mhm.
04_SHA,"That's very probable, you know, but, um, I've. No, cause I've received notes back."
04_WARR,Grapenuts.
04_SHA,"Especially from this one girl. You know, Dear and esteemed teacher..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,Hunh.
04_SHA,"You know, in m-... in Spanish. My child, you know, has already filled out this form, and..."
04_WARR,<XX>.
04_SHA,There was one situation...
04_PAM,<XX> She's sleeping.
04_SHA,There's this little girl Annalisa.
04_PAM,So we can decide about.
04_SHA,That doesn't...
04_PAM,<XX>.
04_SHA,Speak a word of English. And every time I try to get her to say anything in English...
04_PAM,<XX>.
04_SHA,"Cause I made the whole class learn, like, good morning, good bye, can I go to the bathroom, can I stand up, can I go to the... er. Time to go to the cafeteria, and, the office, you know, certain st- terms that related to school. And she, like, you know, I tried to get her to say hello, and she'd be like..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"No puedo, no puedo. I'd be like, yes you can, just say..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,Hello. Hello Annalisa...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"That's what she does, she gets real embarrassed, and she just giggles like a goofball..."
04_CARO,Turns bright red.
04_SHA,"She- she does-. Well, she would, if-. You know, if her skin weren't like really dark brown, she'd probably be bright red..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,How funny man.
04_SHA,"You know... you- You can't really tell when they blush, it's very unusual. But um, her mom, like, it was a horrible situation, where last week, I wasn't there on Thursday, cause I had to fill out all this, stupid n-... n- You know, I had to do all this shit, just in order to get my position secured there with the bureaucracy, so they let me off for a day. And there was a sub, and, what Annalisa claims, and her mother claims, is that on that day, they brought back the application for free lunch, all filled out, and that the sub took it."
04_CARO,Ah...
04_PAM,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,Right.
04_PAM,Oh for goodness sake.
04_SHA,"So, uh you know, I find this out a week later. I kept bugging Annalisa, t- you know, did you bring the form in, did you fill it all out, why don't you get another one, and I search my desk, and it's not there, and I keep calling the office and sending notes, and they keep calling me on the... their stupid intercom system that you can hardly understand <XX>."
04_CARO,"Mm, You have to tell students, never get give a tutor anything... anything... ever. Not even homework. They wouldn't let us give homework to the high school tutors."
04_SHA,I know.
04_CARO,"Because they just, they lose it..."
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,They don't care.
04_SHA,Yeah. Well.
04_CARO,They-. They don't give a shit about anything.
04_SHA,I know...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,I I I hadn't thought of that at th- at that point last week. Let me out of here.
04_CARO,Unless they've just begun subbing.
04_SHA,Well this woman.
04_CARO,Because then they're like...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,What are we gonna learn today...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"See I'm originally a PE teacher, but..."
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,I guess I can teach math...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"You know, they come in with that attitude, and they go, I've always wanted to teach math..."
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"Now, what are we on."
04_SHA,It's gonna be great...
04_CARO,"You know, and you're saying, uh, we're on, uh..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Square root of pi. Uh...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"And they look at you and they go, the what..."
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,So they don't know what the hell they're doing... uh.
04_SHA,Pi.
04_CARO,Why don't we go out and run some laps.
04_SHA,I didn't bring any pie with me today.
04_CARO,You know...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,They. They don't know what they're doing.
04_SHA,"I don't think we can have pie till lunch, kids..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"Yeah. See. It's like, distorted. They don't know what they're doing."
04_SHA,"Well, this lady is apparently, an old sub, who, like, all the teachers know, and apparently she's very reliable."
04_CARO,Ah...
04_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"So whether the paper got in or not, I don't know, but um."
04_CARO,You can't go and ask her...
04_SHA,"Well I k- kept calling the office, and saying do you have this form, and they'd tell me no, and I finally went in there on Thursday, and I'm like look..."
04_CARO,Where is it.
04_SHA,"This kid, you know, she uh most of the time doesn't have money, I have to give it to her myself..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"You know she, she's deprived of lunch, do you. Can-. Do you have a form for her."
04_KATH,They don't have extra lunches left over at the end of the day that they will give away.
04_SHA,W-... on file... no.
04_KATH,You gotta go in and talk to the principal about this.
04_SHA,"Coop, this is a raging bureaucracy, and there's nothing that I can do. I have found that out. When you wait until you hear what th- all they've done with my class, you'll just be disgusted, but."
04_CARO,Fourth grade.
04_SHA,This girl.
04_CARO,Ugh.
04_SHA,"Um, and so I go in there and I'm like, well can you tell me whether the... the form is on file... cause I- I n-. I realize it takes two to three weeks to process, but just tell me whether it's on file. Because if not, I want her to have another one, now. And the woman's like I can't do that, there's a privacy code or whatever, there's a privacy act..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,And I can't access the file... like.
04_CARO,God.
04_SHA,What kind of fucking law is that...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"That you're gonna tell me, that, you know, this kid might have to wait..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"Another month and a half, to e- have any lunch, Because you can't access, you know, her form..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,What's the deal.
04_KATH,Unbelievable.
04_CARO,"They're just giving. I think, it sounds, like, to me, they're giving you a lot of shit for no reason."
04_SHA,"Well they really are picking on the fact that I'm new, like, y-... uh, It's really annoying."
04_CARO,"The fact that you're new, uh, uh."
04_SHA,That I.
04_CARO,"I would, I would go further than that."
04_SHA,I'm not certified. And.
04_CARO,Yeah...
04_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"It's like, the teachers."
04_CARO,And.
04_SHA,Coop this last week.
04_CARO,Can't.
04_SHA,"First they're like, first I only had fifteen kids... right. And the, legally you have to have eighteen. HISD rules has it that you have to have at least eighteen... right. So I'm the only permanent sub. I'm the only teacher who's not experienced, who's not certified, who just started teaching. All these other teachers are old hands, I mean they've all been at it for at-, Well Chris is the least experienced besides me, but still he's, you know, he's had his certification, and he's had a year and stuff, he's real good at it. So, they do shit like, first they tell me, like I find out accidentally, from the other teachers. The principal... doesn't even tell me. First she hires me n- like, the Friday before school starts. And expects me to get my room ready, and then, and then I find out on Thursday, in the first week of school, that I might lose my job."
04_KATH,Yeah you told me.
04_SHA,"Come Friday. Yeah... and, and then, th- so I come into class, and they've put like, all these third-grade students in there. Did I tell you about that."
04_KATH,No.
04_SHA,"It's really annoying... what they've done, to meet the l-... the."
04_KATH,They split it third and fourth.
04_SHA,"Little, technicality that they have to meet, Yeah. They just split the whole thing."
04_KATH,Challenging. Yeah.
04_SHA,"It's, well, it's something."
04_KATH,It's twice as much work for you.
04_SHA,"It's something for experienced teachers. It's not for me. You know, it's like really hard for me. Because, you know, uh and then."
04_KATH,You have to n-.
04_SHA,And then.
04_KATH,"That's what I was doing when I was student teaching, I had split fifth sixth."
04_SHA,"Well they didn't even give me any texts, Coop, I mean I was the only teacher, in the whole school, who did not have textbooks. You know."
04_KATH,Mhm.
04_SHA,Because they were fucking me around so hard. So then on the-... on Friday I have eighteen kids...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"I'm like great. You know. And all these teachers are coming in and saying, Well, my child is on your role, but I'm gonna keep him in my class. You know..."
04_CARO,Mm.
04_SHA,"And I have these three third-graders. You know, but the shitty thing is, that they pick, what the teachers do, is they go, oh, well this, this kid is bad behaved, I mean he's. He's really stupid, I'll just send him over to the new instructor."
04_KATH,Of course.
04_SHA,So they s-. So these are.
04_KATH,Of course.
04_SHA,"The kids that I receive, are the three third-graders, of the lowest education."
04_KATH,That nobody wants.
04_SHA,And the worst conduct. Right. And so th-...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,Meanwhile in the principal's office they're telling me...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"Sorry, I just got a visual..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Sharon standing in front of the class going.
04_SHA,Aw. Sometimes I'm like that.
04_CARO,"While these little kids kinda, senorita Flinn."
04_SHA,Hee hee hee hee hee...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"Oh, Miss Flinn, Miss Flinn, Miss Flinn..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"You know, towards the last couple of days I'm like, I put up a list of rules. And all day long..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,I went back to the rules.
04_CARO,Do not pull on my clothes...
04_SHA,And they get up out of the chair...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"And they come up to me, Miss Flinn, Miss Flinn, and I'd walk over by the rules, and I'd point to number two. And I'd just look at them..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,And they knew what number two was. Don't get out of your seat without permission...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,You know. So they'd look at me and they'd go.
04_CARO,God...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,They'd go back to their chairs...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"On the last day that I was there, like..."
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,It was so awful...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,Because.
04_CARO,Boy. You're a hard ass.
04_SHA,I had to become a hard ass...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,The people w-...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,All the teachers were telling me.
04_SHAN,Could be worse.
04_SHA,"You're too nice, you're too nice, your kids are gonna take advantage of you. And they were. Th- they k-."
04_KATH,Yeah.
04_SHA,"They came to where, they'd be talking the whole time, during the assignment..."
04_KATH,<XX>.
04_CARO,Ah.
04_SHA,"I'd be up at the board, they'd be, I'd turn around they'd go."
04_CARO,Ah.
04_SHA,"Hee hee hee, cause they didn't think I was serious..."
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"And I finally got to the point where, uh you know, every day, I'd have em put their heads on the table for ten minutes..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,Hunh.
04_SHA,"You know, with the- with their eyes closed."
04_CARO,Time out. Quiet time.
04_SHA,And I finally got to where I withheld recess...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"And on the last day, I kept th- four kids after school."
04_KATH,Yeah.
04_SHA,"You know, but you can only actually keep them over, for like five minutes. Cause they have like buses to catch and stuff."
04_KATH,"Well, I'm telling you, withholding goodies works. Because, they'll get kind of surly."
04_SHA,I did that.
04_KATH,But if you give them rewards.
04_SHA,"Well I gave them st-. I gave sticker, you know, to the k-... to the kids, and I put excellent..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"And I give stickers to the kids, and the ones that got good grades, that got one hundreds, and ninety-eights, and ninety-sixes, I put their papers up on the board."
04_KATH,"Well, there are other things you can do besides um, um, you know, you can make up goodies. You don't have to spend money on goodies. You can have like, You can make these little, um, Do they have a laminating machine in the school."
04_SHA,"Not in the school, but in this other lovely place."
04_KATH,Well...
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,"Make these little passes or something that say, one..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,"One free lunch with the teacher. Or one free lunch to sit with whoever you want at lunchtime. I get to sit with my friends at lunch. Or, what. Think up whatever little privileges like that. Um if there's anything in the classroom that they really like to do..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,"Have that be a privilege, that nobody can do, unless they have this pass. And then give those passes out for good behavior at the end of the day."
04_CARO,I have an idea. Choose the Mister Samuel way of teaching...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Take them by the hair...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Boom. Heads against each other...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"Or you can walk up to the chalkboard, and you get really good, so you go and you practice on the weekends..."
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Get chalk from the chalkboard...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,And you just peg it at their face...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,You know.
04_SHA,I remember.
04_CARO,"And you. And you practice. Finally that man was fired, man. It took them how many years."
04_KATH,They fired him.
04_SHA,"Oh, Mister Samuel."
04_CARO,He... k-... sh- God.
04_SHA,He was the most.
04_CARO,"Man, he threatened little kids..."
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"We'd all be sitting in a circle, and it'd be current events time, we'd all be sitting there."
04_SHA,He was harsh.
04_CARO,And one little kid Eli Goodman... would just give him... uh He was just talking. Eli was just talking. Mister Samuel must have had a really bad day...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,He came up...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"Alright you little shit, I'm gonna throw you against this wall. And he threatened it. He threatened to throw the kid against the wall. And we all heard it, and we all."
04_KATH,Went home and told your parents.
04_CARO,"Freaked out... No. Because w-... we were too scared... to do anything. And we would. And our parents would go, oh he's a great guy. And they'd go and visit him and, he would put on the bullshit, and."
04_SHA,He'd be fine...
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"And, no one believed the kids. You know. He was a man, who would walk up to two little boys that were talking, and grab their hair, and actually bang their heads together."
04_SHAN,What a guy.
04_SHA,"He picked Ken Romig up once by the hair, I remember that."
04_CARO,Yeah...
04_SHA,"<XX>, Ken, who's like, was actually very well-behaved, you know, and, and really smart student, went on to be one of those overachievers..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"You know. Just yanked him up, by his little blond hairs."
04_CARO,By the hair. Yep.
04_SHA,We were all like.
04_CARO,Oh...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,But he won't do anything to the girls if they give him backrubs.
04_SHA,That's right. That's right...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"Mister Samuel had like, the most."
04_CARO,"What a jerk, man."
04_SHA,Unethical...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,"Classroom, I can ever remember."
04_CARO,He was a fool. He was an absolute fool.
04_SHA,I remember the... the students.
04_KATH,I remember Muffin being terrified that she was going to be put in his class...
04_SHA,<XX>.
04_CARO,"His daughter, His daughter actually admitted it to me. I saw Sally Samuel."
04_SHA,Admitted what.
04_CARO,"Who is pregnant, and has about. You know. Let's not discuss it. But, I was like, Um."
04_SHA,What did she admit.
04_CARO,How's your father...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"I was kind of crude. But I was like, so what is your father doing right now. Is the man dead yet..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"No... <XX>, I was just very, kind, she goes, Well, he he got fired, and and I said Oh really now..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,That's a surprise.
04_SHA,Que lastima.
04_CARO,"And the guy that he threatened to throw against the wall, was put forward a year. Eli graduated a year before I did. See I didn't understand that..."
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,It was a hush hush deal.
04_CARO,"Didn't make, any sense. It w-. It was really weird."
04_SHA,Well he'd like.
04_KATH,Eli's parents probably tried to get him transfered out of his class.
04_SHA,His classroom was like.
04_KATH,And that was the only way to do it.
04_CARO,No doubt.
04_SHA,Crazy.
04_CARO,No doubt. That man was insane. Definitely insane.
04_SHA,"Hey Coop. What I was gonna tell you about, that really frustrates me is that, uh, that the people- principal and stuff they say to me, Oh, well, what you do with those third-graders, you know, is you just like, take them, and put them, you know, with one of the smarter fourth-graders, who's very verbal."
04_CARO,Uh.
04_SHA,"And and well-behaved. And you have them work as a team, you know, so that the fourth-grader can help the third-grader. But that's bullshit. Because, that just teaches the third-grader, with the lesser intelligence, that, that he's worthless, you know, that he can't learn stuff on his own."
04_KATH,"No it's not. No it's not. You can put them in teams like that, but you don't put one with one. You put, like, two fourth-graders with, how many third-graders do-. What's the ratio of third-graders to fourth-graders."
04_SHA,But they're not.
04_CARO,"You mean, so they don't feel singled out."
04_SHA,Now I have like five third-graders.
04_CARO,Or what.
04_SHA,I have like t- twenty-two kids.
04_KATH,"Okay, so you have fifteen fourth-graders, and five third-graders."
04_SHA,Na-. Uh no. I have like seventeen fourth-graders and five third-graders.
04_KATH,All you have is twelve kids.
04_SHA,What.
04_KATH,You only have twelve kids.
04_SHA,No. Seventeen.
04_KATH,"Oh, okay."
04_SHA,Fourth-graders.
04_KATH,"So then what you do is, you sprinkle the fifth-graders out evenly. And you make the fourth-graders take the responsibility for teaching them."
04_SHA,Third-graders.
04_KATH,"And you engrain in them, that it's their responsibility to help those little kids. That's what I did."
04_SHA,I have been...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,But.
04_KATH,And it works.
04_CARO,Can you. Can you say it's part of your grade.
04_KATH,As long as it's.
04_CARO,Part of your.
04_KATH,Yes. Oh yes.
04_CARO,Corporate-... or.
04_KATH,You bet.
04_CARO,What do you call it.
04_SHA,Well the third-graders.
04_KATH,You tell them that their ability to cooperate is being graded.
04_SHA,Coop. Well the third-graders are just like.
04_KATH,Y-. They're getting a grade in cooperation.
04_SHA,"You know, except for a couple who... who are real smart."
04_CARO,Darn. That would be so hard.
04_SHA,"Feel like, uh, you know, they're incapable. I mean th-... they just feel like <XX>."
04_KATH,Well the fourth-graders try and lord it over em too...
04_SHA,and the fourth-graders will try to just like give them the answers.
04_KATH,There's nothing else you can do about it.
04_SHA,"And it's hard for me to keep track of that. You know. I'll be like, Don't give them the answers."
04_CARO,Standing over.
04_SHA,"I want you to help them understand, but don't just give them the answers."
04_KATH,It takes a long time to teach em how to work together...
04_SHA,"I-... if I can't teach these kids, you know, I go around to the third-graders, I try to teach them individually what a noun is."
04_KATH,It'll start to happen by January Sharon...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,I mean it takes a very long time. It's not easy to do.
04_SHA,I'm not gonna be there until January.
04_CARO,"Have-. Have you explained to them, like, the speech about, making mistakes is part of life, that speech, and..."
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,What's the other speech. The other speech is.
04_SHA,I've given them everything.
04_CARO,"Um, don't give away. Don't give away the answers, because you're d- denying them of learning."
04_KATH,Mhm.
04_CARO,"If y-. If you put it to them in a very simple way, and they get it and they kind of go, yeah."
04_KATH,Well what you want to do is...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,When you have them in groups working on something.
04_SHA,"I have, I have."
04_KATH,It shouldn't be multiple choice. It shouldn't be.
04_SHA,It isn't.
04_KATH,Something easy. They should. They should have to.
04_CARO,Write it out.
04_KATH,Have some discussion going on. Like...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,Give them something to work on that there is no answer to.
04_SHA,But the other fourth-graders it's like.
04_KATH,That is just opinion. They'll learn just as much.
04_SHA,"You know, they don't really wan-... they don't want to help the kids, they. They wa-... you know, they're done, and they want to play, and they get upset with me..."
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,If I expect them to help the third-graders...
04_CARO,<XX> help em to learn the basics...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,Tough.
04_SHA,"And, they don't have the patience."
04_KATH,Too bad.
04_PAM,This is the funny one.
04_SHA,Or the psychology.
04_CARO,Yeah.
04_SHA,"To learn how to teach the kids, Well, when you're subtracting, you bring the one over, and then that becomes ten, and then you have to cross it out, it becomes a nine."
04_CARO,God.
04_SHA,And then you bring the one over.
04_CARO,I couldn't do it.
04_SHA,You know.
04_CARO,I couldn't do it.
04_SHA,"And these. The thing is, that the teachers that had these third-graders before, and a lot of the fourth-graders, really failed as teachers, Cause they didn't teach them."
04_CARO,Diddly.
04_SHA,Jack.
04_KATH,They should have learned that in the second grade.
04_SHA,In the in the second grade I learned my times tables. In the third grade I knew th-.
04_CARO,Fourth grade was.
04_SHA,I had them memorized up until twelve.
04_CARO,Fractions. I failed.
04_SHA,These kids can't do their times tables...
04_CARO,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,The fourth-graders even.
04_KATH,Well they've just.
04_SHA,You know.
04_KATH,They've been.
04_SHA,I have one student.
04_KATH,You know.
04_SHA,Who knows his times tables up until ten.
04_CARO,Wait-.
04_KATH,They.
04_CARO,Uh hey.
04_KATH,The teachers have just been passing them along <XX>.
04_CARO,"Wait a minute, neither did I."
04_SHA,Yeah.
04_CARO,I didn't know them either. I didn't know times tables till s-... like fifth grade. Only cause I was a dufus. But.
04_SHA,Well were.
04_KATH,"No, It was because you were a lazy butt."
04_CARO,"I could not. I could not do fractions, I could not do fractions. And I mean with Samuel as a teacher, who wants to tell them, who wants to go up to this man and say, I have a problem..."
04_KATH,"You didn't really have Mister Samuel, did you."
04_CARO,"Oh, hell yeah..."
04_KATH,"Oh, I thought you got out of being in his class."
04_CARO,"Unh-unh. I had him, my whole fourth-grade year. And then there was a possibility the following year, that he was going to teach fifth grade..."
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Cause our fifth-grade teacher was leaving...
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,So all of us were like...
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,Shitting in our pants going...
04_KATH,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,No...
04_SHAN,<NONVERBAL>
04_SHA,<NONVERBAL>
04_CARO,"Please, no. We just. We lucked out, man. But we got Missis Lindberg, who was like, the first granola woman I ever met..."
04_PAM,Granola woman...
04_CARO,"She would say, Let's go on a field trip. We're gonna go on a hike... NA"
