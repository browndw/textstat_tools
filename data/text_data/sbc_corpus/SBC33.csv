33_JENN,"You know, this family works on guilt. The engine of this family, is a little guilt motor. That goes vroom vroom vroom..."
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,I don't agree with you.
33_JENN,I totally agree.
33_BILL,Right.
33_JENN,I don't. And.

33_BILL,But what.
33_LEAN,You totally agree with yourself.
33_BILL,What are we.
33_LAUR,Totally agree...
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,"Jennifer, you're agreeing with yourself."

33_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,I totally agree with me...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,"Boy if that isn't conceit, nothing is."
33_LISB,That's why it's not believable...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_X,<XX>...
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,I totally agree.
33_DON,Such a great statement...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,Fill in the box. It's like giving yourself a survey...
33_DON,<XX>...
33_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,Right.
33_LISB,Agree with yours-...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,Do you think you're a wonderful person...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,Yes. Check...
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>

33_JENN,Shut up...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_MARY,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_MARY,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,<XX>.
33_BILL,"We three, we're all alone..."
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,Living in misery.
33_DON,Living sery.
33_JENN,There's. There is a fine line.
33_BILL,My echo.
33_DON,My echo.
33_BILL,My shadow.
33_DON,My shadow...
33_MARY,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,And me.
33_DON,And me...
33_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"There is a fine line though, between guilt and responsibility..."
33_MARY,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,Like you're feeling a responsibility towards people.
33_DON,Ah. Mm.
33_JENN,"And the feeling of guilt, to make yourself do things."
33_DON,Mhm.
33_BILL,Right.
33_JENN,"And I think that line, is really fuzzy but I think, often."
33_DON,Talk to me.
33_JENN,The guilt strings are tugged very hard.
33_LEAN,That is the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard.
33_JENN,No it's not.
33_BILL,Often.
33_JENN,You and I have had a talk about this before.
33_BILL,You're not an orphan.
33_LEAN,No. Well I happen to think yes.
33_DON,Now tell me.
33_LEAN,That guilt is a very massive part of this family.
33_DON,Jenn- w-. What happened <XX>.
33_RICH,Guilt for.
33_LEAN,"Guilt, no, she's right to a certain extent."
33_BILL,Bullshit.
33_LEAN,This family... is...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,To a certain extent.
33_LAUR,How do you.
33_LEAN,I qualified.
33_BILL,Bullshit.
33_LEAN,We believe in guilt.
33_BILL,Bullshit.
33_LEAN,You don't think this family uses guilt.
33_LAUR,Well I.
33_BILL,"The trouble is, a little guilt goes a long way."
33_DON,Long way.
33_LEAN,Especially if you're Jewish.
33_JENN,Yeah.
33_LAUR,Do you think.
33_BILL,"And you guys feel a little bit guilty, about the way you've treated us all these years of life."
33_LEAN,Oh what a crock...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,Now guilt works two ways.
33_LEAN,That's bullshit.
33_LISB,Now I've been looking for the May seventeenth New Yorker.
33_LEAN,"Oh please, Mother, I've learned."
33_RICH,Hm...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,"She's like, out there. You're."
33_BILL,Liz.
33_LEAN,Liz.
33_BILL,Are you in this conversation or not.
33_LEAN,You're outre mer.
33_LISB,I hear it...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,I hear it...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,Hunh. You hear it.
33_LEAN,You're uh duh.
33_BILL,Oh I think.
33_LEAN,Mom.
33_DON,Uh.
33_LAUR,Wait. My gla-. I have m-. I have. I just go without glasses on...
33_LEAN,I need <XX>. Mom.
33_LAUR,What.
33_LEAN,"Here's the deal. You guilt me, and in response, I guilt you straight back."
33_LAUR,T-. In response.
33_LISB,Uh To guilt. That's now a verb. That's like Tara said today.
33_BILL,It's a new verb...
33_DON,"<XX>, To beguilt, to."
33_LISB,To w-...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,Uh.
33_LAUR,Got.
33_LISB,I'll water you.
33_LAUR,"Said, I'll water you."
33_LISB,I'll water you.
33_LEAN,"Cause, she's gonna sprout you know. But, like sometimes, what I'll say to you is, you'll you'll start guilting me. And what I'll do in response, is I'll say Mom, you're guilting me. Whereupon you immediately."
33_LISB,Gilting. That's putting a little coat of gold on top isn't it.
33_BILL,Gold. Yeah that's right. That's right.
33_DON,Correct.
33_LEAN,"That's gilting, not guilting..."
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,Excuse me.
33_LEAN,"Liz. Sort of like airplane and, what's, oh plane and plain. That's it. Um, Mom."
33_LAUR,Yes.
33_LEAN,"Oh and plain, and plane."
33_LISB,"Oh, maybe this is it."
33_LEAN,"Um, that thought, whereupon, you, like, develop guilt."
33_LAUR,Well I think what Jennifer said is correct... uh How do you separate responsibility from guilt.
33_BILL,"Well if you have no feeling of responsibility, no amount of guilt will appear in your head."
33_LEAN,Exact ly.
33_LISB,"Guilt, in- in fact, the distinction between guilt and responsibility is, you must feel that you have responsibility, that you have failed."
33_BILL,In order to feel guilt.
33_LISB,Then you have.
33_X,I agree.
33_BILL,It's a little bit like sin and confession.
33_LISB,Guilt.
33_LEAN,You have guilt.
33_JENN,"No but then, somebody, but, but that's."
33_BILL,Mhm.
33_LAUR,Mhm.
33_LISB,Can't have one without the other.
33_JENN,"That's exactly, that's exactly right."
33_LEAN,This thing is leaking.
33_JENN,There can be somebody who makes you feel like you have a responsibility.
33_LEAN,"Liz, this is moving."
33_JENN,"In a case, when that is not necessarily clear."
33_LISB,Ah. So guilt is not the issue.
33_LAUR,Ah.
33_LISB,The issue is a denial of responsibility.
33_JENN,"No no no, no, you totally turned what I said around..."
33_LISB,<XX> where I set those.
33_JENN,There's an ac...
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"Agent there, who is making you feel responsible, for something that you are not responsible for."
33_BILL,Well how could.
33_LAUR,Then you don't.
33_LISB,Responsibility is not...
33_LEAN,<XX> to how you know you're responsible.
33_LISB,"Uh... is not an objective phenomena, Jennifer."
33_JENN,It is often when they have been defined.
33_LISB,Unless you've signed a contract.
33_JENN,No when there have been defined responsibility.
33_BILL,Right. For exam-.
33_LISB,"Okay. In most human relationships, there are no, defined, written in in in."
33_JENN,Monogamy is a good example...
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,In uh.
33_BILL,What what what are we talking about now...
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,No.
33_BILL,Monogamy.
33_JENN,I'm just talking about.
33_BILL,Why.
33_JENN,I'm trying to think about family...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,Trying to make me feel guilty.
33_JENN,Situations...
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,I'm tro- talking about family situations...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"I'm talking about like set-. Cleaning up after yourself. Or doing things, that you have clearly defined, as rules in this house."
33_LISB,That is correct.
33_JENN,As your responsibility.
33_LISB,Oh excuse me.
33_LAUR,Is that bad.
33_JENN,As.
33_LISB,Whose responsibility.
33_JENN,"As. No no. As your, our."
33_RICH,Wait I want to go back to this monogamy thing.
33_JENN,The individual person...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_RICH,What is...
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_RICH,What is that...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"No, I'm just trying-. I was just trying to think of examples, of what are assumed..."
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"But never, assumed, but never delineated."
33_LEAN,Good question.
33_LISB,"And therefore, if it's assumed and not delineated, does responsibility exist or not."
33_JENN,It does.
33_LISB,Ah. Good. So we have.
33_LAUR,Wait wait. I'm losing.
33_LISB,Except.
33_LAUR,I...
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,Responsibility.
33_LAUR,Assumed.
33_RICH,You lost half of us back <XX>...
33_MARY,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,"Responsibility can be either assumed or asked, like."
33_LAUR,Or explicit.
33_LEAN,Certain.
33_LISB,There seem to be three categories. There's no responsibility.
33_LEAN,Assumed <XX>.
33_LISB,"There is responsibility, but it's inarticulate. Or it's articulate."
33_JENN,That's right.
33_LISB,Two categories. Okay.
33_JENN,Right.
33_LISB,"So now we got, we're all together now."
33_JENN,And so when. When there is.
33_LEAN,"So wait, can you have guilt for all three forms of responsibility."
33_LISB,Should I get a blackboard.
33_RICH,No...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"No, and I'm saying-, and she said that."
33_RICH,I'm still confused.
33_JENN,She's saying...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,We're not talking about guilt.
33_LEAN,He's still confused about monogamy.
33_RICH,"I'm sorry, I'm dumb..."
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_MARY,<NONVERBAL>
33_DON,I'm sorry.
33_JENN,"We're we're not talking about. She says, g- oh, we're not talking about guilt, we're talking about responsibility, and denial of responsibility, and I said no. We're talking about somebody who makes you feel responsible, for something that is not necessarily always going on."
33_LISB,"And I said to her, how do you know."
33_LAUR,What was this about.
33_LISB,"What your respons-. Her statement about, we'll walk back and."
33_JENN,Well I came over here...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"And she-. I said, I looked at her chocolate."
33_LISB,"I admit, I was making <XX>."
33_LEAN,We have to go back to where they were.
33_JENN,I looked at her chocolate.
33_LEAN,You can't just.
33_LAUR,Back to the setting.
33_LISB,I bought that chocolate.
33_JENN,I looked at her chocolate...
33_LEAN,<XX> <XX>.
33_JENN,"I said mm, and you said, you can't have any of my chocolate..."
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"You've got to be nicer to me, if you want some of my chocolate..."
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"And then I said, what. And I said, what am I not nice to you about."
33_LAUR,That-. That's a.
33_DON,Did sh-.
33_LAUR,That's a statement of guilt.
33_LEAN,A way to <XX> <XX> <XX>.
33_LAUR,Responsibility.
33_JENN,They...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,Dad but wait a second.
33_JENN,I.
33_DON,Yeah.
33_JENN,Well thank you.
33_BILL,"No that, you're quite right Jennifer..."
33_JENN,Ker chunk...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,"Quite right, it's like when my father used to say..."
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,You'll be sorry when I'm dead and gone.
33_JENN,Exactly.
33_DON,Please...
33_LISB,But do you n- don't think she has a responsibility to be good to me.
33_JENN,Fuck you. But.
33_BILL,No.
33_LEAN,Wait a minute wait wait wait.
33_BILL,The implication is she's not.
33_LAUR,Oh no no.
33_LEAN,"Wait wait wait, whoa whoa whoa. Wait a second. Apropos something Jennifer said in May."
33_LISB,Uh...
33_BILL,"The implication is that, she's not good to you."
33_LISB,That's right.
33_BILL,But not everybody has agreed with that implication.
33_LEAN,Wait Lisbeth.
33_LISB,You didn't.
33_LEAN,Lisbeth.
33_LISB,Yeah but you were not in the s-... in the.
33_JENN,Uh.
33_LISB,In. Christmas tree shop.
33_JENN,Uh.
33_LEAN,Wait wait wait wait wait.
33_JENN,Uh.
33_LISB,When she carried on...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,"Wait, no Jenn, sit, <XX> <XX> on her."
33_LISB,"About my behavior, at the checkout counter."
33_LEAN,"Lisbeth, apropos something Jennifer said in."
33_BILL,"Oh, wait a min-, what did you do at the checkout counter."
33_LEAN,"Whoa, apropos something Jennifer said in May."
33_LAUR,Well wait. You know Liz.
33_DON,"Ma, we have to hear this."
33_LEAN,Wait wait <XX> I...
33_JENN,<XX>.
33_BILL,Will you let Leanne finish.
33_JENN,Did I <XX>.
33_LEAN,"Wait, time. Can I say something. Jennifer and I and Dana had a huge argument in May, which created a rift for about a day. Which was b- concerning you and grandma."
33_JENN,"No not in May, because I wasn't here in May."
33_LISB,"Oh, let's not start."
33_LAUR,Mhm.
33_LISB,Let's not start.
33_JENN,"What, what about the checkout counter then."
33_LEAN,But that's responsibility.
33_JENN,"You were about to, you were about to correct my mother."
33_LEAN,"So, so."
33_JENN,On something about the checkout-.
33_LAUR,"Well I, I think there is a. Uh you see."
33_DON,What happened at the checkout counter.
33_BILL,What hap-. We wanna know.
33_JENN,Mom says I pounced on her...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"And all I did, this is what I did."
33_LAUR,I don't know what happened.
33_JENN,I went Mom.
33_LISB,Calm down. And then.
33_JENN,"No, I didn't say it loud, I just went like this. I said."
33_LISB,"Y- uh, sh- such a lie..."
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,Uh Did I pounce.
33_LISB,You said-. Such a.
33_LAUR,I was uh. I didn't see what happened in the checkout counter.
33_LEAN,What.
33_JENN,I do not pounce on you.
33_LAUR,I was gonna offer an opinion about the d-... the d-... the disagreement there. About the uh.
33_BILL,What was she doing there why you.
33_LAUR,The trust.
33_JENN,The trust involved. Do you think that's true any.
33_LAUR,Yeah. Yeah I do think that's true.
33_LISB,"But it was not about Jennifer, it was about the lady."
33_LAUR,"Right. But I, I happened to agree with Jennifer. Because it reminds me of all these old people in the supermarket, who are standing there going, are you sure that's twenty one cents, or twenty two cents. It's programmed into the computer."
33_LISB,I...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,"The lady specifically said, to hold off with putting things on the counter."
33_JENN,"Mom was getting a h-, was starting to hyperventilate..."
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,At the checkout counter...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,There were so many objects going on the counter.
33_JENN,It was making her crazy...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,Just so many objects...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,And it was not clear...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,For a little...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,"Few minutes there, what was already rung in, and what was not rung in. And I did not want the lady to get confused, and ring in items more than once."
33_JENN,So she.
33_LISB,"And she specifically said, not to put everything on the counter."
33_LAUR,"Okay. Well then, I didn't, I didn't know that."
33_BILL,"Yeah, and so what happened."
33_LISB,Starts putting everything on the counter.
33_JENN,"No, I w-. Acts like I'm a child, like I'm just throwing things on. I was not."
33_LISB,No.
33_JENN,There was an order to how I was doing it...
33_RICH,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,It was yeah. One at a time.
33_LEAN,Yeah but Jennifer. As-. One person's order is another person's mess.
33_JENN,No...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,Especially if you look in my bedroom...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,"Mom was starting to hyperventilate, about something that did not require a breakdown, and I was trying to pat her on the shoulder."
33_X,Ts- uh...
33_LEAN,<NONVERBAL>
33_LISB,It looks a bit. And I said to her in the car.
33_JENN,And say it was okay.
33_LISB,"That this language, just makes me angry. This exaggerated language..."
33_JENN,<XX>.
33_X,Ts.
33_RICH,What does this have to do with guilt...
33_LISB,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,Right...
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,Right.
33_DON,I don't know Rich.
33_LEAN,Or monogamy.
33_BILL,What does it have to do with monogamy. That's what I wanna know.
33_LEAN,"Yeah, I wanna come back to the monogamy thing Jenn..."
33_DON,<NONVERBAL>
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_JENN,That was a slip.
33_DON,A slip...
33_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
33_X,<NONVERBAL>
33_MARY,Where did that language of exaggeration come from.
33_DON,Uh.
33_BILL,"You know what, there's two sides to this."
33_MARY,As a joke.
33_LISB,Uh.
33_MARY,"Cause it's uh my disease. And, Mimi Fogarty is like the biggest perpetrator of it."
33_BILL,Mimi Fogarty-.
33_LISB,You don't exaggerate.
33_BILL,Oh.
33_MARY,She d-.
33_BILL,Oh.
33_LISB,You're very cautious. It seems to me.
33_MARY,"But sometimes I do, cause when I'm around other people, I tend to talk like them."
33_BILL,Well uh.
33_MARY,"Just like, just little jokey things, just like."
33_LISB,Yeah but that's just.
33_MARY,With numbers and stuff.
33_BILL,Jennifer.
33_LISB,That's how you make humor. That's how you make humor.
33_MARY,"Yeah, that's just humor."
33_BILL,Jennifer and Lisbeth are hyper uh sensitive.
33_MARY,Like I told you twenty times.
33_BILL,"To one another's language. So, if Jennifer says..."
33_MARY,<XX>.
33_BILL,"Uh Mom, Lisbeth hears, a lot more into it than Mom."
33_MARY,Right.
33_BILL,And if m- Lisbeth says.
33_MARY,Jennifer.
33_BILL,"Jennifer, Jennifer hears uh paragraphs."
33_MARY,Yeah. Sure.
33_BILL,So there's a long history here.
33_LEAN,Nine-tenths of that paragraph is guilt.
33_LAUR,Well that. That's like Leanne's.
33_BILL,And then...
33_LEAN,<XX> <XX>.
33_JENN,We'll have very short sentences...
33_LEAN,<XX>.
33_LAUR,The button that you gave me. Don't look at me in that tone of voice.
33_JENN,We'll write very short letters to one another.
33_MARY,Did you have that with your mother though.
33_BILL,Right...
33_LAUR,<NONVERBAL>
33_LEAN,The other times.
33_MARY,Well that's a possibility.
