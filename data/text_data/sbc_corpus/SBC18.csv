18_MARC,"They might not actually be, be um, back in the barn-... or from the barn yet."
18_LIND,"Good morning, this is Doctor Naretto at the Kingman Vet Service..."
18_KRIS,<XX> <XX> <XX> <XX> <XX> <XX> <XX>.
18_LIND,I saw Tad this morning.
18_MARC,Yeah.
18_LIND,"Um, He's looking not too bad, Um, A little bit of pain in his abdomen. It's hard to know if he just has, a gastritis, or gastroenteritis, from chewing on that dead pigeon, or what the problem is. Um, what we ended up doing was, giving him some antibiotics, and sending him home, um, If he does not improve, we may need to take some <XX>-rays, and he's got some bones, or something in there. I didn't feel anything in his belly, but, yeah. A lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things, they'll just get an upset stomach, and, um, also a little bit of uh, uh well, just inflamation in- in there... and and just feel bad. So, um, I, You know, Since he's not vomiting now, you can go ahead and feed him and stuff, and see, how he does, Um, hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any any infection, that he, h- that he might have gotten from all the bacteria on the dead pigeon... um, but if he, if he doesn't get better, or if he gets worse, be sure and let us know... well, but-. Already by tomorrow, he should be feeling a lot better. Um, and if he, if he isn't, or if he starts vomiting, or having diarrhea, we may need to see him... we... we w- will need to see him again... so... um, Okay. Mhm, you're welcome, mm bye."
18_MARC,"Sh- uh, what did you, what on your sheet, what was the cost for the cast that you charged about, what do we generally."
18_LIND,I think it was like fifty. With the cast.
18_MARC,Oh.
18_LIND,To put it on.
18_MARC,To actually put the cast on.
18_LIND,Casting materials and then.
18_MARC,Okay.
18_LIND,"And then um, She had... pretty much when we rechecked her, she was ready to take it off. So we didn't have to do any more <XX>-rays or anything."
18_MARC,Okay.
18_LIND,"I'm trying to remember, I think, like, with the white."
18_MARC,You got. I thought you <XX>-rayed it. You <XX>-rayed it with the cast on.
18_LIND,Yeah. Mhm...
18_MARC,"<XX>, Yeah."
18_LIND,"Yeah, yeah... and it was ready to come off, and we took it off. She did a real good job of keeping it..."
18_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
18_LIND,"Keeping it clean, and dry. That's, I think, half the battle... cause, she didn't have any sores, or anything, when we took it off."
18_MARC,"Mm yeah. Kristen, for the, for the tranquilizer what do we, what is it again."
18_KRIS,Ten.
18_MARC,Ten. I wonder if she would need more.
18_KRIS,"And it'll be. Oh he'll, yeah. For a casting."
18_MARC,To do a cast... <XX> <XX> Biotal.
18_KRIS,"If you just, biotal and, Metofane..."
18_MARC,<XX>.
18_KRIS,We just.
18_MARC,Or even.
18_KRIS,We'll put him on the machine. And then you don't have to worry about em.
18_MARC,"What was, what would that."
18_KRIS,That would be thirteen.
18_MARC,"Total... or, thirteen extra."
18_KRIS,"No... plus thirteen, for anesthesia... to put this cast on. Cause if you don't, then y-... they're waking up, and you just."
18_MARC,It's bad.
18_KRIS,"End up spending more time, than if you just put em on the silly machine."
18_MARC,Okay.
18_LIND,Yep. As we know from the sheep.
18_KRIS,"Well, and from other things too. Just."
18_MARC,Yeah.
18_KRIS,Are those good. Do you like em.
18_LIND,Yeah. Did you make em.
18_KRIS,"I made em. Yeah... ah. I was thinking they were more like a, chocolate chip cookie bar. And then as I got through the recipe, I noticed that they don't have any flour in em..."
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_LIND,They're good.
18_KRIS,So they're actually more like granola bars than.
18_LIND,They must have. Yeah.
18_KRIS,Cookie bars.
18_LIND,Yeah.
18_KRIS,"They've got brown sugar and butter, and."
18_LIND,Tastes like they have peanut butter.
18_KRIS,"Oatmeal, and peanut butter chips... chocolate chips."
18_MARC,"Okay, so a recheck would be about that much, with the."
18_LIND,Mhm...
18_MARC,"<XX>-rays, and then, <XX> <XX>, Does that sound right... thirty-two, I think, uh if we... she woke up, we could w- send her home tonight, I wouldn't see why we couldn't send her home tonight, would you."
18_LIND,"If she wakes up, fine."
18_MARC,"Oh well, we're gonna be Biotaling her and oh."
18_KRIS,"Sh- if sh-... she probably won't, though."
18_MARC,"Never mind. Never mind. I was thinking, I'm still thinking."
18_KRIS,Na...
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_KRIS,"Na na, na na na, And she won't have any an- uh antibiotics, Cause using all <XX> <XX>."
18_MARC,No.
18_KRIS,And that.
18_MARC,Thirty-two.
18_KRIS,What is this.
18_MARC,"Ten, for anesthesia."
18_KRIS,Oh.
18_MARC,But.
18_KRIS,They're still opposite.
18_MARC,They're opposite...
18_KRIS,"Yeah, That looks all right..."
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_KRIS,Don't you think we should charge them an extra eighteen.
18_MARC,For the distemper vaccine.
18_KRIS,Trent does it.
18_MARC,No.
18_KRIS,"I felt horrible doing that on that eye dog, that he had in here last week, under whatever night it was. Cause he had down... twenty-five plus eighteen, and what can you do, when he's already got it down."
18_MARC,"Jeez... uh. Well, Well, all we did. I can't do that, cause all we did was, I was in here and put a bandage on."
18_LIND,Yeah. Yeah...
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_KRIS,"Um, did you get hold of Dan... then."
18_LIND,Yeah. He's...
18_MARC,<XX>.
18_KRIS,Let's see...
18_TREN,Six.
18_KRIS,Let me see.
18_TREN,Fifty-six.
18_KRIS,"Let me see, we need, one of these and one of these, one of those, and one of those, and two of those..."
18_MARC,<XX>.
18_TREN,Three.
18_LIND,Sent home with Amoxi...
18_TREN,<XX> fifty-three.
18_LIND,"And Pred, So, We'll se how."
18_KRIS,"Yeah. Well, I'll call him probably late this afternoon, to make sure he's all right..."
18_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
18_MARC,"<XX>, <XX> <XX> <XX>..."
18_KRIS,<XX> there.
18_MARC,"No, I was just trying to figure out what we spent already."
18_LIND,Mm. Mm.
18_MARC,"Let' see, <XX>, We've already spent fifty for him, and I want him to spend another hundred."
18_LIND,Well.
18_MARC,But that's better than pins.
18_LIND,Right.
18_MARC,And surgery.
18_LIND,"Which would be another, two hundred or."
18_KRIS,Yeah. It's more for a surgery.
18_MARC,To spend.
18_LIND,Any... pretty much any time you can.
18_MARC,"And that one really, you know, I don't think it would benefit from pins."
18_LIND,M-m.
18_MARC,"Because, we'd have to undo it. I mean we'd have to, Well, we'd have to go, we could... we could try it closed."
18_LIND,Mhm.
18_MARC,"But, still, it's more expensive."
18_LIND,I think it'll do fine with a cast... especially since it's a spiral fracture.
18_MARC,And it's not displaced.
18_LIND,"And it's not displaced... should be pretty stable. It'll be kind of a pain getting the... well, maybe not, getting the cast over the stifle. Maybe not."
18_MARC,"Well, as long as she's."
18_LIND,Got kinda long legs.
18_MARC,"As long as she's quiet. Okay. I'll give him a call. I don't know if he's in the barn, from home. In back in from the barn yet or not..."
18_HEID,<XX>.
18_MARC,Well...
18_HEID,"<XX> called both the house number, and the barn number, and both of em, and, a little kid answered."
18_LIND,Mm. Yeah and they're little little kids too...
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_KRIS,<XX> <XX>.
18_HEID,Mhm...
18_KRIS,<XX>.
18_LIND,"They're like, <XX>, <XX>, on three..."
18_MARC,"Yeah Carol. It's Marcia. Hi... um, we got <XX>-rays done already, and, I was gonna let you know what, what was going on. Should I talk to Richard... or you okay. Okay. Um, It looks like she's got a spiral fracture, Of um, of her tibia, which is the bone between the knee and the hock, and, um, It's f-... it's really looks, pretty stable. It's not displaced very far uh anyway, and it's, um, pretty much, you know, locked in place, so to speak, um, so I think, that she would, she would do fine with a cast. Um, and, I pretty much got an estimate, so far, with the, coming in yesterday, and the <XX>-rays and everything, the bill was about fifty-four. And, to do a cast, um, with the anasthesia, and staying one more night in the hospital and stuff, and then the casting material, probably the... uh It's gonna be about a hundred and fifty-three, total. And, the only, then it would be, the only extra would be, in about six to eight weeks, we'd have her come in again, we would tranquilize her, and take the <XX>-rays, and see if it's healed. Enough to take off. And that's generally about thirty-four to forty, somewhere in there. Yeah. You know, a pin, you know, if we did a pin, it's probably, it would probably be even a hundred more... but, so it's, it's, That's about the... at this point the, the least expensive alternative, that probably will work, for her. Um, So, If you want to let him know and then, have him call me back, if you."
18_KRIS,Lindsey.
18_MARC,If you wanna go ahead and do it. Okay.
18_KRIS,You wanna put this kitty castration down.
18_LIND,Sure...
18_KRIS,<XX>.
18_MARC,"Alright. And if she... you know, if we did it, she could probably go home tomorrow... Okay, whenever, whenever you get a chance. Okay, thanks Carol. Mhm, bye-bye..."
18_LIND,"Gee, this is the one that was too young, and went back home..."
18_HEID,<XX> <XX> <XX>.
18_MARC,"She's... she's gonna, talk to him, and get back to me. I imagine they might."
18_LIND,Oh you've grown.
18_KRIS,"He gets it just right, he's just getting his adult <XX>."
18_LIND,What a cuty. Oh you're beautiful...
18_KRIS,"<XX>, Pretty unusual with that... <XX>."
18_LIND,"Hey beautiful... <XX>. Oh, you're beautiful..."
18_MARC,<XX> <XX>.
18_LIND,"Oh, Yes..."
18_HEID,<XX>.
18_MARC,That's what it sounds like.
18_HEID,It kind of sounds like that.
18_MARC,"Sounds like it, with the ticking..."
18_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
18_LIND,Is that the needle.
18_HEID,"Kingman Vet Center, Heidi speaking."
18_LIND,Yeah...
18_CAT,<NONVERBAL>
18_LIND,<XX> it hurt. You felt the needle... aw...
18_MARC,<XX> <XX>.
18_LIND,Yeah.
18_HEID,"Okay, is this a dog we've seen before."
18_KRIS,Gonna call back.
18_MARC,Yeah. I talked to Carol.
18_HEID,"Okay, how old is it."
18_MARC,"And she's gonna talk to Richard, and."
18_HEID,"Okay, just a moment... <XX> I'll let you talk to one of the vets."
18_LIND,I imagine they might go for it.
18_MARC,It's about the cheapest alternative in the world.
18_HEID,Jeremiah Hassel.
18_KRIS,You stay right here with me.
18_HEID,Is on the phone.
18_MARC,What.
18_HEID,"And they've got a dog, in about three weeks, and she was dripping some blood Saturday night. He's wondering what it may be, and, They wa-."
18_LIND,Mmm.
18_HEID,They must have got a replacement for Faith already.
18_LIND,I don't know.
18_MARC,Who's that that called.
18_HEID,Jeremiah Hassel.
18_LIND,Hassel...
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_KRIS,You stay here...
18_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
18_KRIS,I'l l be right back.
18_MARC,Could it be aborting.
18_LIND,"Yeah, could be."
18_KRIS,Who's aborting.
18_MARC,"Jeremiah Hassel's, they got a dog that's pregnant and."
18_KRIS,Jeez. I heard them.
18_MARC,"Due in three weeks, and their dog's dripping blood and they're wondering why."
18_KRIS,"I heard, and I thought it was him... he didn't give his name, but I heard a kid on, p- whatever that shopping thing is on the radio."
18_LIND,Prime Mover.
18_KRIS,"Prime mover. On Saturday morning. Saying that they had a few puppies left that they were gonna sell, and then they're taking orders for Christmas puppies. And I thought, that's probably who that was."
18_LIND,"Last week, or..."
18_KRIS,<XX>.
18_MARC,"Guess they gotta make money somehow, huh."
18_LIND,"Oh, Saturday night."
18_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
