38_BEN,"Okay folks, we're coming to a short stairway, use the handrails, and be careful please..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,"Okay folks, let's find out where we are. We got on the elevator right here, came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant, down that stairway, out on the power plant ramp about that far, then right at that yellow line. And you're now standing over the second-largest water pipe in the world, and it's called a penstock. More about that a little bit later. The Colorado River, flows in this direction. In order to build a dam here, the very first thing they had to do, was to get rid of that river. So they came up here above where the dam was to be built, and drilled and blasted out, four diversion tunnels. Two on either side, into the canyon wall, around where the dam was to be built, out in the river down below. Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty-six feet in diameter, and then lined with three feet of concrete. You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels. They then came up here, and they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high, to force this river into these diversion tunnels. Came back down here, built the other part of that cofferdam, about sixty-five feet high, to keep this water from backing into the work area. They now had from here, to here where they could build a dam. They pumped the water out of this area, and excavated down another hundred and thirty-five feet to bedrock. Okay folks, if you will please, take a look at this picture taken during construction, looks like a series of boxes or blocks, stacked one on top of the other, and those are wooden concrete forms. Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high, but they did vary in area somewhat, because they did not build the dam right straight across the river, from canyon wall to canyon wall, they built it in the form of an arc. And it's called an arch gravity design dam. Where the force of the water, coming down the Colorado River hits the face of the dam, and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wall. It's a very strong design. They did build two concrete mixing plants here, they did pour concrete for twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year. For two years, less six days. Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight-cubic-yard bucketloads. Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms, the smallest of which is twenty-two by twenty-five feet, only filled that form up about three or four inches deep. So there goes that story you may have heard, that there are workers buried in the concrete here. Couldn't possibly happen. But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete, was one-inch steel water pipe. They came down here in this lower cofferdam, and they built an ice plant. Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day. They used that ice, to chill the water, that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete. As concrete hardens, or cures as we call it, it produces heat. The more you can control that heat, the better job of curing you're going to get. So they used the chilled water method, of taking that cold water, forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete, picking up some of that heat, then carrying that heat out and away. They felt if they did not use a method such as this, that it would've taken approximately one hundred and fifty years, for the concrete in the interior part of the dam to cool down. So the system did work. And then it hardened, and they remove these wooden forms, they left voids. Vertically and horizontally these forms came together, those voids were filled with grout. Under high pressure. Grout being a mixture of concrete and water. When this is done, you have what we call a modified monolithic pour, or basically a solid block of concrete, which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base, fourty-five feet across the top, twelve hundred and fourty-four feet from wingtip to wingtip, seven hundred and twenty-six point four feet high. Six point six million tons of concrete. That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway from New York City to San Francisco. Or, put another way, a four-foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole. Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit, the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways. As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon, you may have noticed those spillways. Here they are, one on either side. What they did, is they came in here, and they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here, closed these gates up here, now this yellow part is forever under water. Underneath that lake out there, and completely useless. But they did incorporate, into the design of the dam, the balance of those diversion tunnels, using these outer two as spillway tunnels. Now these spillways were built, so that the top of the spillway, is twenty-seven feet lower than the top of the dam. This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the Colorado River, rather than overtopping the dam, overtops these spillways on either side, goes into the canyon wall, around the dam, out in the river down below. Each one of these spillways is capable of handling two hundred thousand cubic feet per second of water. That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls. Falls three times higher than Niagara Falls does, time that water reaches this area down in here, it is flowing at between one hundred, and one hundred and twenty miles an hour. Okay we have protected the spillways, now they had to get some water, uh- into the power plant. What they did is they built four intake towers. Two on either side of the river, on ledges above the river, each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake, are three hundred and ninety-five feet high. Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them, one gate near the bottom, one about half way up, to let the water in. The water then coming into the penstocks, like the one we're standing over right now. This penstock, you can see on either side of us out here, is three stories high, or thirty feet in diameter, made of two-and-three-quarter-inch steel boilerplate. Made in section twenty-two feet long. Each section weighing approximately a hundred and fifty tons. Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next section, using pressure pins like this. The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon, approximately two hundred and thirty-four pounds per square inch. Okay we have the water this far, now we divert that into thirteen-foot penstocks or water pipes, each one of em going to a turbine. The force of the water turns the turbine, which turns the rotor in the generator, and generates power. The water then coming on the tailrace, we saw it up there, and going on downstream to be used at least six more times, before it reaches the Mexican border, to generate more power. Good clean reusable non-polluting source of energy. The cost of the project. A hundred and seventy-five million dollars. I say project, because that includes the building of the dam, the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road, the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site, and in southern California they built the All-American Canal, which takes water to the people and the crops, of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys. This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent interest, and was paid off in full in nineteen eighty-seven. The people who worked here, and they did work twenty-four hours a day, average twenty-four-hour work force was about thirty-five hundred men. The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete, fourty-three hundred men. The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour. Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator, at a dollar and a quarter an hour. Out of each man's paycheck, the contractor did deduct each day, a dollar and sixty cents. Because the contractor was feeding, and housing the men in Boulder City, and taking them back and forth out here to the job site. They did have ninety-six industrial deaths. The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material. Basically falling rock. But they did have some killed by explosion, some by drowning, some by electrocution, and other types of accidents you might expect to have. On a job of this magnitude. They did complete the project, two years ahead of schedule, and under budget. Started in early nineteen thirty-one, completed in late nineteen thirty-five. Just twelve days short of five years. Do I have any questions."
38_AUD,What's this overhead pipe here <XX>.
38_BEN,"The overhead pipe. That's the fresh air pipe. In the summertime, the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees. So they bring that fresh air in, and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam, the water in that sump is a constant fifty-three degrees. It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two degrees, then they force it back throughout the dam. So it's air-conditioning without refrigeration. Like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler. Any other questions. Yes."
38_AUD,"Uh, during the uh earthquake this morning, do you have any sensors down here, that measure any kind of movement, of structures."
38_BEN,"Right. Yes. W- v- we have several things. First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam. We recorded those, but nobody down here felt em. But we do have sensors, built right into the concrete, any movement that concrete makes, is measured and recorded. And they had very little of it this morning. Very little. Any other questions."
38_AUD,How far are you sending electricity. California.
38_BEN,"Okay. Fifty-six percent of our power goes to southern California, twenty-five percent of it stays in Nevada, nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona. What the government did, is they got together the delegates from those three states in nineteen thirty. To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed. California was growing very fast at that time, so they asked for and got most of the power. But by the same token, Las Vegas, about thirty-five miles up the road here, at that time, was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad. No hotels, no casinos, we asked Las Vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here, and they agreed to do that. But that's all they get today. Because that contract is good through the year two-thousand and seventeen. So all those lights. You see burning up there in Las Vegas, comes from power from steam plants, owned and operated by Nevada Power Company, using fossil fuel. They get very little of our hydroelectric power. Okay folks, you can follow me now, I'm gonna lead us out of here... Okay, here we go folks..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_AUD,Quite amazing.
38_BEN,Y- yes it's a fantastic job they did down here.
38_AUD,Yeah...
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_AUD,About how many people are employed here. Now.
38_BEN,"Right now there's about two hundred. That includes the security people, the guide force, the nursing staff, the people that run the computer room, the office force, as well as the people that work on the dam. And that's a twenty-four-hour figure. But that figure is becoming smaller every year, because every year we are becoming more highly computerized... Okay folks, there's a tour group coming in, stay to your right please, stay to your right..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,"Stay to your right folks, tour group coming out..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,"Okay, if you would, right up this stairway, when you get on the balcony, wait for me on the blue couches on the balcony please. Anybody needs the elevator it's available..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,Anybody that needs the elevator it's is available...
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,Come on...
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,"Come on then. Up the stairway if you can <XX>. Up the stairway. That's. Up the stairs. Okay, here we go. Hi."
38_AUD,"That was the turbine over here, off to the side."
38_BEN,"Yeah, that's the turbine runner. You bet. That's a computer design made of stainless steel, it's designed in such a way, there's one of em running at a hundred and eighty RPM, it actually lifts that eight hundred tons up a quarter of an inch, for your main thrust bearing is the very top of this uh structure right down here. This is the rotor. The rotor and the runner, have come out of our A-Seven generator, what happened we lost a water seal down there. So we had to pull those out to fix that water seal, they'll be replaced within a couple of weeks now."
38_AUD,Oh I see.
38_BEN,That rotor in that part of the shaft weighs five hundred and eighty tons...
38_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,"Okay folks, if you will please, follow me now..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_X,Hey <XX>.
38_BEN,How you doing.
38_X,Good...
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,"Okay folks, while we're waiting for the elevators, does anybody have any questions."
38_AUD,How long have you been doing these tours.
38_BEN,"About five years. About five years. I've retired twice, can't stand retirement so, come back to work at a fun job."
38_AUD,Oh.
38_BEN,Anybody have any questions.
38_AUD,"Yeah, Ben, water comes down the center of the, where your shaft is, goes out the turbine."
38_BEN,"No. Goes around the dam. Water comes into those towers, goes around the dam, comes in from the side."
38_AUD,Each individual turbine.
38_BEN,Yeah.
38_AUD,"The water drops in the center where the shaft goes in, then goes down."
38_BEN,"No no. No. It comes into what they c-. It comes in that thirteen-foot pipe, goes into what they call, the area of the wicket gate, and there. And there's a pipe around that wicket gate, and that pipe goes from a thirteen-foot diameter, down to a three-foot diameter, goes around that wicket gate. Okay."
38_AUD,Right.
38_BEN,"It picks up speed. By the time it enters that ap-... uh goes out that aperture, that three-foot aperture, it's traveling at fifty-seven miles an hour. But that's what drives that big turbine. It goes around the shaft. It doesn't go into the shaft area at all. The wicket gate... uh All the water goes in through the wicket gate."
38_AUD,It's coming in underneath.
38_BEN,Yeah. The wick-.
38_AUD,Perpendicular.
38_BEN,Uh Th- uh well.
38_AUD,Perpendicular to the shaft.
38_BEN,And uh uh yeah.
38_AUD,The generator's sitting on top.
38_BEN,"A- i- okay. The shaft is like this, and water's coming in like this."
38_AUD,Right. That's what I thought.
38_BEN,And then it goes around like this.
38_AUD,Oh yeah.
38_BEN,And then out.
38_AUD,"Now that thing we saw down laying that-, uh, alongside."
38_BEN,Okay.
38_AUD,"With the uh, looked like a."
38_BEN,"That's a, uh that's a r- turbine runner. We call. Turbine runner."
38_AUD,"That- and that's, is that is that, kicked up on the side like that, the water."
38_BEN,"No, it just lays it."
38_AUD,Spinning it around.
38_BEN,Oh you mean the one d- on the floor down there.
38_AUD,Yeah yeah.
38_BEN,No that's laying flat like this...
38_AUD,<XX>.
38_BEN,And the water drives that around this way like this.
38_AUD,Oh you're right <XX>.
38_BEN,And drives the turbine up there yeah.
38_AUD,"And that's down inside the uh, in the turbine."
38_BEN,That's way down. Yeah. Way down in the turbine.
38_AUD,So it's in the turbine. And that's the.
38_BEN,"Unhunh, yeah."
38_AUD,That's what's generating.
38_BEN,Yeah.
38_AUD,That's what's turning the wheel.
38_BEN,Right. Right.
38_AUD,We were right on that.
38_BEN,"Right. Okay folks, step right in the elevator please, right on in, step right in the elevator. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen, nineteen, twenty, alright, are you with them. Okay. Okay I saved room for you."
38_AUD,"All right, thanks a lot man."
38_BEN,"You bet. Folks this does conclude your tour of the dam, hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoying have you, come back and see us again. Have any questions on the way up, ask Norm. Bye-bye folks. Okay, any more questions folks."
38_AUD,What's the story with this tile. Wasn't this created by somebody.
38_BEN,"Yeah. Folks, the dam was built as a tourist attraction, as well as being very functional, this terrazzo flooring you see, terrazzo is marble chips put down in concrete, ground down and polished, this terrazzo flooring was put in here by one Italian family, by the name of Martina. Okay there's two and three-quarter acres of this uh t- uh terrazzo flooring in the floor, but the designs you see, is what that Italian family saw uh, and interpretated from southwest Indian blankets and pottery. That's where the designs came from. Any other questions."
38_AUD,"Are there just two elevators down, from these two shafts, that'll take you to <XX>."
38_BEN,That's right. Two elevators down. Mhm.
38_AUD,The rest of it's just solid.
38_BEN,"Right. Well there are, there are two miles of uh tunnels going this way across the dam. They have a pipe gallery, they have a drainage gallery, they have a... a uh cable gallery, and they have an instrumentation gallery. And all those things are. They measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery."
38_AUD,Y'all open seven days a week.
38_BEN,Yeah. Mhm.
38_AUD,"Is it unusual to-, to do the generator uh room floor. In something like this. There's just."
38_BEN,"Yeah. It it's in fact, it was built during the depression, and they wanted to make it a tourist attra-."
38_AUD,Make it make it worth talking.
38_BEN,"It was at that time the largest dam in the world, they wanted to make it very nice, yeah, it's unusual. Usually you just have concrete decks."
38_AUD,Yeah. I would. Yeah.
38_BEN,Yeah. Yeah. Any other questions folks. Yes.
38_AUD,What are the chances of a leak.
38_BEN,Hm...
38_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
38_AUD,What are the chances of a leak.
38_BEN,"Well, uh it leaks all the time. You see concrete's porous. And because concrete's porous, there's water coming through at all times. But that's good. Because if there're no moisture in concrete, it dries out, and spalls and chips, and turns to powder. Wouldn't make a very good dam. So as long as that lake is back there, forcing that water through the concrete at all times, it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green. Green concrete's very strong. So we have a good strong dam."
38_AUD,Say Ben.
38_BEN,Yes.
38_AUD,"What's going on up on the hill up here, don't think it's uh."
38_BEN,"Okay. That's a five-story parking garage, and the new building is a new visitors center. The five-story parking garage will hold four-hundred and fifty cars. Okay, the new f- visitors center, will have three revolving theaters in it, it'll have a seating area for people going on tour, it'll have a museum, the top deck of that building will be an observation platform, we can look back at the dam in one direction, downstream in the other. Now, when that's all done, they hope to be able to figure, to handle between one point two and one point three million people a year. Last year we had, seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine people go through the dam, but we had to turn people away, almost every night. Just not enough time in the day, to get everybody through the dam that would like to see it."
38_AUD,Hmm. Will it have any slot machines in it.
38_BEN,"No, but it'd be a good idea..."
38_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,Wouldn't it...
38_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
38_BEN,Pay for this place...
38_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
38_AUD,When's completion on that parking garage.
38_BEN,"They figure between fifteen and seventeen months. Yeah. Okay folks, step right in the elevator please. Right on in..."
38_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
38_X,Everyone please face the front of the car.
38_AUD,It's gonna be seventeen more months. Seventeen more months.
38_X,Everyone face the front of the car please.
38_BEN,Right to there.
38_X,Front of the car please.
38_AUD,Have they ever had to use the spillway.
38_BEN,"Just a minute. Okay folks, this does conclude your tour of the dam, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed having you, come back and see us again, have any questions on the way up, ask Norm. Bye-bye folks."
38_AUD,Thanks Ben.
38_AUD2,Have they ever had to use the spillway.
38_BEN,"Okay. Folks, the question is, did they ever have to use the spillway. Yes. Just once in the history of the dam, and that was nineteen eighty-three. What happened that year, is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, and that was followed by rain and hot weather, which created a flooding condition. We had more water coming down the Colorado River system, than they could put through the power plant. Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year. On July second, water overtopped our spillways out here. Six days later, it was going over four and a half feet high. And that went on for sixty-six days. At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam, or to the power plant, but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain, they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage, but no loss of life. But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there. That white line indicates it was going over the spillways, four and a half feet above floodstage. It gives a false impression, and makes it look like the lake of the level is low. Or level the lake of the low. Actually we're eight feet above normal, for this time of year."
38_AUD,Wow.
38_BEN,Yeah we had a very good snowpack last year... NA
