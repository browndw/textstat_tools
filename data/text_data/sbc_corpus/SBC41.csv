41_KRIS,"Well let's kind of figure out a classic, um, uh diet, uh, quota, uh uh for you. And, let me get a piece of paper, so that we can write that down..."
41_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,The way we do this.
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,"Is first of all, we make a, a guesstimate, of how many calories, typically, that you would need. D- we- we didn't do this last time did we."
41_PAIG,Hm-m.
41_KRIS,"Okay. Alright. Yeah, I think we were gonna wait, until we, cause you were gonna change some things maybe, after you saw Doris. So, first of all we make a good guesstimate. Of how many calories you need. And that's always a tough one. Um."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Most women, unless you work out a lot. You probably aren't burning much more than like eighteen hundred, to maybe two thousand calories."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"So, what we can do, um, I would say, I'm gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred. Just because, uh, you're at a good weight, you're about five five, um, I think that would be a prudent place to, to start out from. I know I won't uh, cause you to gain weight, and, you probably won't lose any either. But uh..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,Okay. So we're gonna take eighteen hundred calories...
41_PAIG,"Uh h-. How um, how many calories do you think I'm eating now, or can you even tell that..."
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,From looking.
41_KRIS,"I could do a calorie count, um, on that, but I'd actually need more amounts."
41_PAIG,"Although, you wouldn't be able to tell, because, there's no, uh I don't write down, like the fats, and things like that."
41_KRIS,"Well, if, if you gave me real specific amounts. Like, I had, you know, one quarter cup of soy milk, half a cup of cereal."
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,Then I could.
41_PAIG,"Oh, okay-."
41_KRIS,I could count your calories.
41_PAIG,I see...
41_KRIS,And and figure that out. And run it through the computer. And get a printout.
41_PAIG,Mm...
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,Hm.
41_KRIS,"Of your nutrient ratio, and everything."
41_PAIG,Wow.
41_KRIS,"For the day. In fact if you wanna do that, I'd be glad to run it for you, But you'd have to take one day."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,And really.
41_PAIG,And write everything down. Yeah.
41_KRIS,Be...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"Like, precise."
41_PAIG,Okay.
41_KRIS,"Um, okay. So eighteen hundred calories, times, point four, that's gonna be forty calories, or excuse me. Um forty percent of your calories, coming from carbo hydrate. And that's Doris's standard protocol really."
41_PAIG,Mm.
41_KRIS,"Okay times point four, gives us seven hundred and twenty carbohydrate calories."
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,Then we divide that by four...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,Calories per gram. You've...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"I know you've seen this before. Which gives us a quota, of a hundred and eighty grams of carbohydrate per day. Actually I should've done that."
41_PAIG,Mm.
41_KRIS,Okay. Then we have to distribute it.
41_PAIG,Wow. That's low...
41_KRIS,Yeah.
41_PAIG,That's not that much.
41_KRIS,It is...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"Then we have to distribute that, into a, an ideal ratio. Now you always do have breakfast. Really. Unless you're running, a bit on the higher side."
41_PAIG,Really high. Yeah.
41_KRIS,"And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much, and you always have some kind of dinner."
41_PAIG,Well yeah.
41_KRIS,Basically...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"Now the mid-morning snack, the snacks are hit and miss. That's where, we maybe, would h- have to, to look at things. A little bit more closely. But usually, lunch and dinner are your main meals. And we would give you about, a thirty percent quota, at both lunch and dinner, which is, about fifty four grams, at each of those places."
41_PAIG,Hm.
41_KRIS,"Would be sort of your ballpark quota. And, uh it's not outlandish. Like here you were sixty-four, well, a little bit higher. Um."
41_PAIG,Mm.
41_KRIS,"Here, well you were about uh forty fifty-nine, sixty-four. So sixty-four, fifty, that was seventy-four. So it's a little bit higher. Is what you're used to doing."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"And, um..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,Yes.
41_PAIG,"Yeah uh, I remember. Like, a long long time ago. Let's see uh, it was, I guess forty, maybe forty forty-five seventy. Or something."
41_KRIS,Okay.
41_PAIG,That's how they had it divided up.
41_KRIS,Okay.
41_PAIG,"I think. Although, that's m- more. Right. Let's see..."
41_KRIS,T sounds pretty high.
41_PAIG,That's. Yeah.
41_KRIS,Yeah.
41_PAIG,"That's, what. A total of a hundred and."
41_KRIS,"It might've been based, either on a higher calorie level..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"Or, a higher percent, of your calories coming from carbos."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,Like if this were fifty percent.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Which is probably more realistic, for how you eat."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Being a vegetarian, you eat more... uh And we can change it up. But we'll use this as a base. And then we wanna compare it."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"To what you typically do, and, the thing is if you started doing this right now, you'd have low blood sugars."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,Cause you've already adjusted your insulin.
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,To another level.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"But I think what you could learn from this, is that, um, at least, if you sort of chose a standard place for a while."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Until you got things a little more stabilized, it might be easier, to do your insulin."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,"And then, um, once you, y- are a little more comfortable with that, then you can start doing this flux with."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,"Adding the unit for another ten grams. Say if you usually have sixty-four, and you find, you know, ex units of insulin works for that."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Well, uh then you can- jockey it from there. Now at breakfast, we often keep that down around twelve, because."
41_PAIG,Twelve. Wow.
41_KRIS,"Uh, percent. Uh."
41_PAIG,Oh.
41_KRIS,Point one two times.
41_PAIG,"I thought you meant grams. I was gonna say h-, where do you find food, that's that low."
41_KRIS,Well...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,Some people actually end up having to do that. That's only about twenty-two grams.
41_PAIG,"Zero, or something."
41_KRIS,Because of that dawn phenomenon.
41_PAIG,Mm. Mm.
41_KRIS,"So, that's not much, at all. Then."
41_PAIG,"Yeah, like even an English muffin is too much."
41_KRIS,Unhunh. Unhunh.
41_PAIG,Even oatmeal.
41_KRIS,"It's it's uh really difficult... you can either have, either or, sort of a thing. Let's see, sixty seventy-two, okay. So that gives us a twenty-eight, to distribute throughout the rest of the day. And, um, making a decision of how to do that, really involves your insulins. Now, in the morning, you've got a good amount. Of regular insulin that you take."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"So I would wanna put a little bit higher percentage, for your snack there. Like."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,I would say maybe even ten percent here. Um.
41_PAIG,"See, I hate that snack... uh Having to eat snacks."
41_KRIS,Uh Oh.
41_PAIG,I just don't have time...
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,You know.
41_KRIS,The only trouble with that is.
41_PAIG,Uh uh.
41_KRIS,"At breakfast, you, just won't have your insulins there for you, to eat the big carbo breakfast, typically."
41_PAIG,Mm.
41_KRIS,"Unless, you run high, after breakfast. And then it comes down, when the insulins finally do get working."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,But then you're running high.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"And that's, you know, that's the only way to protect yourself."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,"Is yeah, you eat a bunch of carbo, you take a bunch of insulin, you run high for an hour and a half."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,And then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,When all the insulins get on board.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"So, um."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,"Anyway. Uh, point one, okay, that's just gonna be eighteen."
41_PAIG,I wonder how.
41_KRIS,Roughly there.
41_PAIG,"Uh How does Doris do that though. Because she like, I don't think she eats lunch, or anything. I mean..."
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,"She just like, has this really minimal dose of NPH, I think."
41_KRIS,You'd have to ask her.
41_PAIG,That's what uh.
41_KRIS,I don't know.
41_PAIG,That's what I suspect...
41_KRIS,"I don't know the trade secrets there. Um, but uh, h- uh you know I think, probably, um, keeping the carbos a little on the lower side, enable. Of course then you'd need less insulin, which makes life easier."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,"It does make it easier, if you do eat less carbo. Cause you don't have to take these big amounts, and then wonder what they're gonna do and when."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Um, this actually, sometimes makes it more complicated. Now, mid afternoon... you are taking a touch of regular at lunch, but you don't really eat much of a snack. Usually. After lunch. Cause you have a late lunch, might have some Cheetos there I see."
41_PAIG,"Mhm. Oh, that was just cause I was like."
41_KRIS,Um.
41_PAIG,Couldn't eat dinner.
41_KRIS,Cashews.
41_PAIG,Hm.
41_KRIS,Um...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,"I had to go to something, like right at, at six o'clock, or seven o'clock, or something."
41_KRIS,So that really may be one...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"Where, it's sort of debatable. You know, maybe at the most you'd have five percent there. Um, and I'm just sort of guessing, as a place to start, uh why'd I do that. I knew what it was. And that's just hardly anything. That's a f-. Some, a few nuts. Really. And that's about it or, uh um, then later on, you do sometimes eat after dinner. Cause you're kind of a nightowl, and um..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"Let's see this'll go twenty-two, plus, uh, so we're looking at, about, roughly, thirteen fifteen percent there, so, okay so, approximately well s-, essentially like breakfast... So, those would just be places to start from. But I think, um, what's even more important."
41_PAIG,Okay.
41_KRIS,"Is, you've gotta tailor it, to what your insulin is. And use these as a jumping off place. You know, if you say, well this is ridiculous, I always have a seventy carbo dinner."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Well, so what. You know, uh there's nothing wrong with that, it just means, you slightly adjust that insulin. Same thing if you don't like snacks, what are you gonna do to compensate."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"For the fact, that, there's there's a lotta insulin there maybe. And um."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Uh how are you gonna get around that. Um, but that's the sole purpose of snacks, is to really prevent, lows from happening, and to counteract, um, the insulin time actions. Um, So."
41_PAIG,Hm.
41_KRIS,M-.
41_PAIG,Oh.
41_KRIS,Maybe we should compare-.
41_PAIG,Uh.
41_KRIS,Go ahead...
41_PAIG,"Oh, I just had one question, so for example."
41_KRIS,Unhunh.
41_PAIG,"Say I didn't eat lunch. Then what would happen. Like, then I could not take the insulin there..."
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,And then.
41_KRIS,Well.
41_PAIG,"But then, I don't know."
41_KRIS,You probably would need to eat a little something.
41_PAIG,"I wonder. I would get high then maybe, hunh..."
41_KRIS,"Because, of your NPH peaking."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Although, you don't take a lot of NPH. So."
41_PAIG,In the morning yeah.
41_KRIS,"It may be debatable, if you really need to have something, later in the af-, uh or, b- to get you into dinner, okay. Um."
41_PAIG,Hmm.
41_KRIS,"You know, you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack, if you don't."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Um, or, yeah. Take, look at, look at the NPH that you're taking, and, y- uh Doris could help you with that. Did she give you a scale for a w- no lunch, lunch scale."
41_PAIG,"A w- while ago, but um, it changed after that. See this was the original thing. That I had. She said, but. Okay, this was, hm. This was a while ago. See, three twenty-four ninety-four. So, um, like, for example, she had these two things, so if I was gonna eat, like say I, I decided ok-, in the morning. I was gonna eat lunch. Then, I would take four, units of NPH and then, supplement it, with the regular, but if I knew, like say in the morning. That I wasn't gonna eat lunch. Then."
41_KRIS,Hm.
41_PAIG,"She said take uh. But this doesn't make any sense. To me. Take six NPH, cause I would be low, with this then, definitely..."
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,You know.
41_KRIS,Yeah.
41_PAIG,In in the afternoon.
41_KRIS,Hunh. Okay. Yeah uh.
41_PAIG,I think this was kinda guessing.
41_KRIS,Well.
41_PAIG,"Too... uh Cause, it was before."
41_KRIS,Hm.
41_PAIG,Uh I had really.
41_KRIS,"Yeah. Definitely, um, uh you know, check with her, on your insulins. Cause, uh you know, she, is the only one that can really clarify them. Um, uh you know, just, it's tough. To, to do the jockeying of of the food, and the insulin. It really, um, uh."
41_PAIG,Mm.
41_KRIS,"It it just, it makes it really, um, a a challenge there to."
41_PAIG,"Well, this is where I got the idea that she d- uh. Probably doesn't eat lunch. Well, uh I don't know how she would have time, anyway. Every time you see her, it's like, you know five minutes here, five minutes there, but um, then, also, just like um, I don't know. She sort of, like, knew what I meant, when I was saying."
41_KRIS,Unhunh. Unhunh.
41_PAIG,"Oh, it's such a pain to have to stop and eat lunch."
41_KRIS,Mhm.
41_PAIG,"You know. And, so, um, that's where I got that idea. But."
41_KRIS,"Mm. Mhm. Well, it's, uh. Yeah. Let's see. And so four of N, six of N, and then zero regular there."
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,"Hm. That's where just monitoring, monitoring, monitoring. Um."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Lets you know, if if it's gonna work for you, or not. If it's too strong, or, not strong enough."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Um, yeah. Yeah."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,"So it's, Well anyway, how can I. How can I help you with all this..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"I feel like uh, we're uh still in a pickle, in that um, it's just, every day, is so different..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,And...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,You know you're you're adjusting your insulins.
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,"Uh, per your, uh, protocols that you have there, and the carbos are varying around that, um, but, uh you know, I think it's important we, uh make some kind of a a goal, to uh prevent these lows from happening."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"And uh, try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high. And, you know, what do you think, um, that uh you could do, to h- clarify this a little bit more and..."
41_PAIG,Oh.
41_KRIS,Make it a little easier...
41_PAIG,"Well, I guess maybe if I try this. M- maybe that's the only way. Cause it seems like to me that um, I don't know. I don't know. It's. Maybe it's easier, if I have like some kind of set thing, cause then."
41_KRIS,Yeah. Something to shoot for.
41_PAIG,Uh Yeah.
41_KRIS,Kinda.
41_PAIG,"Uh Cause otherwise, I'll just do whatever I feel like doing."
41_KRIS,Right.
41_PAIG,You know...
41_KRIS,Right...
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,Uh.
41_PAIG,Obviously...
41_KRIS,"<XX>, Well, uh you you could give this a try, as far as the levels, but what I would do, is, is use, what you're currently doing as sort of a backup guide. Because, obviously, if you're having, and and this has changed. A lot. Uh over the past few days. But um, well one day you have thirty-eight at breakfast. The next day you have none. Um."
41_PAIG,Uh Yeah but that's like if it's high...
41_KRIS,Forty.
41_PAIG,"And it also, like sometimes I just write em in different columns. Cause."
41_KRIS,Okay.
41_PAIG,"Cause uh, depending on what time it was."
41_KRIS,"But, if you're having only, you know. Around, and what you could do is sort of round these. A little bit. Like shoot for say twenty-five, or."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Just say every morning, you're gonna have a thirty."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,Like a thirty gram carbohydrate brekfast. Period.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"That's um, uh it it would work. And then you just start learning from that."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"You know, you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement, on what you were doing, as far as, uh dropping it down a little bit."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,"And yet, it would be, s- it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast, or bread."
41_PAIG,Right. Right.
41_KRIS,"Or English muffins, so you could just lock into that. And uh, see see how that goes. Um, uh, mid morning, well, that's kind of a debatable one, cause you don't really like to have the snack."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"But, try it. And see. Maybe carry something with you. And it could be something simple. You might make this just sort of a, a plastic baggie full of crackers. That you take with you wherever you go."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Right.
41_KRIS,And just make it a standard habit.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Or, it could be a piece of fruit. That is gonna be approximately in that ballpark. And, lunchtime. I I would say maybe rounding it, I might round it to sixty. So, so what if we increase your quota up to about forty-five percent."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,It's not a big deal. That that's not the most important thing. The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas consistently.
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Um, here, I don't think you'll have any problem eating something later on after dinner..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
41_KRIS,"If anything it's, it's gonna be, trying to maybe keep this down."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Around fifteen to thirty, or something in that ballpark."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"But, I agree, that if you can make it a little more rock steady, you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more, if you have a schedule that you're trying."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,To to go for. But these are a little bit more scientifically derived.
41_PAIG,Yeah. Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Based on, uh what insulins are doing, a- a- and when."
41_PAIG,Right.
41_KRIS,So.
41_PAIG,Yeah. Hm.
41_KRIS,Questions. Uh.
41_PAIG,"No, I'm just, I was just looking at this number, and thinking, Oh, if I only eat that, amount of carbohydrate at dinner..."
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,I'll be just like dropping...
41_KRIS,<NONVERBAL>
41_PAIG,Uh You know. All night long.
41_KRIS,With your.
41_PAIG,"And and, that is so annoying. It's like you have to keep eating, and keep eating. Cause I've had that happen..."
41_KRIS,"Well, maybe realistically what you wanna do, is keep this one, uh because lunch, well what are you gonna have really. You're gonna have, yeah. A couple tortillas, or maybe a sandwich, or something along that line."
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,"Maybe realistically, this is only about, forty, or fiftyish."
41_PAIG,Yeah.
41_KRIS,"Okay. So that's fine... uh I would just adjust this, to, fifty, or forty-five, or whatever you see fit."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"But dinner, you're right. You have control, in that you have a regular sliding scale, that you can use, and, maybe b-, realistically you should make this seventy."
41_PAIG,Mhm. Mhm.
41_KRIS,"And just, but, but call it seventy, and then really try to stand by that. And look at the insulin, look at your numbers before and after, and what does happen over the course of the evening. Um, do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours. Or."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"Uh, uh or what..."
41_PAIG,Mhm.
41_KRIS,"But but look at it and see, but stand by it. Make it like seventy, and then just stick to it."
41_PAIG,Uh uh Mhm.
41_KRIS,Um.
41_PAIG,Okay.
41_KRIS,So.
41_PAIG,Okay...
41_KRIS,"So, anyway. That's something you could play with for uh a little while, and see if if it um helps, in getting rid of some of the outliers. That we're trying to fix up. So, um, other questions. Uh..."
41_PAIG,<NONVERBAL>
