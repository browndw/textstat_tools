25_FOST,"So Erasmus laid the the-... laid the egg, which Luther hatched. And um, when you come then, to, uh, however this debate. This freedom of the will. Um, I think uh, let me read you a page from Brendler. Because it sets the sa- stage very nicely. This is in the Luther book some of you are reading, and um, if you, this evening when you go home, if you wanna meditate it on more, on- on it more, it's on page three eleven. It's on page three eleven. But, let me just read you the-, cause this gives us the setting very nicely, and then we can uh, Erasmus entitled his anti-Luther pamphlet, diatribe concerning free will. Once again, the first and fundamental questions, disputed in fifteen sixteen, and fifteen seventeen, and again in Heidelberg, in April of fifteen eighteen, with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology, were debated. Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate. And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus. You alone. Among all the others, have recognized the key question. And you do not bore me. With the Papacy, purgatory, indulgences, and similar nonsense. You, and you alone, have identified that on which all else hinges. And you have put the razor to the throat. And for that I thank you heartily. Um, thus Luther evalu- uh evaluated the subject. And Erasmus commented on the significance of their engagement, in battle, in his own style. And he wrote to Luther. Perhaps an Erasmus who writes against you, will do more for the Gospel, than certain dunderheads who support you. And then, humanistic thinking, will never consent, this is Brendler now, obs-... uh on this uh, but this sets the stage for what we're gonna talk about, humanistic thinking will never consent, to the doctrine of original sin. Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin. The author of uh, what is it, Houseman I think, of Invictus. I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. I don't think that he would acknowledge original sin. Is based uh, alright, what is it, it's based, as it is, on the concept, that human nature is totally depraved, and of itself not capable of any good will. And that apart from grace alone, free will is nothing, can do nothing, does nothing, except depraved deeds. Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based, and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system, they do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man-... dignity of man. Catholic, and semi-pelagianism, with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace, finally views, free will, as the decisive factor in attaining salvation. Thereby conceptualizing free will, as similar to a healthy man-... healthy human understanding, for how can a person, be responsible for his deeds, if he possesses no free will. This is what Erasmus asked. How can he decide between good and evil. So reasoned Erasmus. Such arguments, long known to Luther, and many times presented to him, impressed him not in the least. God alone is salvation. God alone measures guilt. He alone condemns. He alone grants grace. Justifies and saves. When he will, and whom he will. Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative. Man can only accept the divine judgment. This is in fact best. And if by. And... and it is by the divine prerogative, that man will... uh, that man is well provided for. For God alone is infallible, and his being is grace and mercy. This concept, that man is divinely elected to salvation, or to damnation, is the center of the predestination dogma. That later, the Geneva reformer Calvin, made the center of his teaching. And that subsequently, under other historical preconditions and circumstances, could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class, in the Netherlands, and in England. Um, uh, skip this paragraph, this is the paragraph though. Right here. The next one. P- on page three twelve. When you, when you read-... if you wanna read it later. Therefore, Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine. Such arguments, on the contrary, necessarily appeared to Luther, given his theological orientation, as suspicious. From the very start. Because they originated from human nature. Which exalted itself against God. The whore reason. Prefers to submit to the Devil. Adjusts to all situations. And proves everything, that is demanded of her. Human nature, does not possess free will. It is like a horse. Ridden by God or the Devil. The rider possesses the will. The horse obeys. Well that's as clear as you can get it. Human nature is like a horse. Ridden by God or the Devil. The rider possesses free will. The horse obeys. Alright that, th now the debate is joined you see. And as you come... as Erasmus comes to this, he's going to say, well let's look at the Scriptures. Now, number one, we have to admit first-... v- first off, that there seem to be passages, there are passages in the Scriptures, are there not. Many. Which seem to teach, that man is responsible for his deeds, and that he may act, and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God. Isn't that clear in the Scriptures. Whosoever will may come. Um, Jesus turned to his disciples, you remember, when some deserted him, and seemed, because they were disappointed in some of his sayings, and they were offended by some of the things he said, and they walked no longer with him it said. And then he turned to those who remained, and he said, Will ye also go away. They had a choice. Didn't they. Will you go away. What do you will. And the will, apparently was, re- resided in in these disciples. And so Erasmus is going to say, so obviously, in Scripture we have paradox. We have clear passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate that man has a free will, and that he can exercise that will, to follow, or not to follow. To respond or not to respond. On the other hand, we have passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate, that the will is not free, and that the-, and that man i- th- is-... man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God. We have to take both these pass-. So it's not a question of the Scriptural authority. We both accept the scriptural authority. And Erasmus in his writings, and in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio, in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio, says to Luther, qu- because it is addressed to Luther you see, he says to Luther, uh, I will not church. I will not question, or I not. I will not quote. I will not quote the Church Fathers to you, because I understand you accept no Church Father authority, if it is in disagreement with your opinion. So I will quote the only authority that you recognize, The Holy Scriptures. And so, uh, exclusively Erasmus will appeal to the Scriptures, as his basis. When God created Adam and Eve in the garden, he placed them in the garden, and he said you have a choice. Uh, you have a choice. Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good-... of the tree of good and evil, for on the day ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die. Now, do not do that, and obviously God must have given, the first created pair, a choice. Because the whole system of reward or punishment, is based upon the decision which is these individuals made. Or, when Cain slew Abel. Um, if you do well. Shall you not be s- sustained. But if you do evil. Sin crouches at the door. If you do well. Apparently, from this, Cain had the ability, even after the mur-... uh uh even after the murder of Abel, he had the ability, to make a positive choice. According to Erasmus. That's going to be his position. Well Luther, um, I'll g- I'll I'll tell- say some of the things that he he picked first, Erasmus picked first, and um, he's gonna go all through the Scriptures, and he's gonna take passages like this, um, return return the prophets said, did they not to ancient Israel. Return to the God of the covenant, return Hosea pleads with Gomer, please come back t you see. And uh, this is the symbol of Israel, come back to the Lord, come back to the the husband of the covenant, come back to the one who called you and summoned you, it's the-. Erasmus says the whole premise is, that you have a- an ability, to return. That you can make up your mind, to change the course that you're now taking. And that you can go this way, or you can go that way. And uh, then there are other arguments which are, uh, here's uh, here's one on um, I'll read an excerpt, in this uh, in this little book, this is the um, the actual uh, wr- writings of the s- f- freedom of the will, here's he he uses Ecclesiastes. God, and this is a quote, from the b-... from the book. God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel. He added his commandments, and precepts. If thou would keep the commandments, and perform acceptable fidelity forever, they shall preserve thee. He hath set w-... he hath set water and fire before thee. Stretch forth thy hand, to which thou wilt. Before man is life and death. Good and evil. That which he shall choose, shall be given him. Choose. So Erasmus's argument is, you have a right to choose. You can choose. And therefore if you can choose, this presupposes that you have a free will. In any rate, if man is, uh, if there is a necessity in man's action. If he is predetermined to sin. If if God has already determined, that this person commits these acts. Then there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor. On the part of the perpetrator. Because how can a person be held responsible for deeds, which he does, if he himself did not will those, the- f-... if, in other words, he may will those deeds, but those... th- those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force. If that is the case, then there is really no freedom of the will. And if uh, in that case, therefore, a person cannot be responsible for his deeds, if the deeds which he commits, have already been eternally foreordained. This is uh, this is going to be then Erasmus's argument, ag- on this qu- on this question of the freedom of the will. But uh, uh, we'll look at another couple p- uh of his passages. If, here it is. If the will were not free, sin could not be attributed to man. It ceases to be sin. If it is not voluntary. Free will is not extinct. Though it has contracted a paralysis. How is it paralyzed. Well it's paralyzed by the fall. See we all participate in the Adamic nature. And this Adamic nature, uh, when Adam, in Adam, remember the New Eng- New England primer, in Adam's fall, we sinned all. So, this Adamic nature has been, has been passed on to all generations of humans. And so therefore while we... we have a free will, it is... it is paralyzed. It's not the will that was there. It's not the will, that uh, that Adam had. Because it no longer has the freedom that Adam had. It is cursed by sin. It is under the curse of sin. So the human will, somehow, is paralyzed. Uh Erasmus admits that. And then, Erasmus will say, that um, God then enables. What God does, and this will be the C- really the modern Catholic view. That God will provide a prevenient grace. A prevenient grace. That is in other words, even though I am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation, you see, that um, that God will give me a prevenient grace, which will enable me, to move toward this salvation. And if I then respond... positively. To the gift of God, then God will extend the exemplary grace to me, which enables me to acquire salvation. So prevenient grace, will put you on the path. If you respond on the path, then God extends the exemplary grace, which will lead you home. He uses a little story. A little uh uh allegory. Or figure I guess. Uh there uh there's a n-... there's a tot, a toddler. Uh, but he's got to be uh- big enough to appreciate apples. Okay. Because, his, alright, because that's the, that's part of the story. There a nice shiny apple. Over here. Over here, you see. And this little tot, he sees the apple. And he uh, he needs, he wants to get to this apple. Um, so he starts in the direction of the apple. But he's very unsteady. He wavers. You see, and he's not, so, what is the prevenient grace. The prevenient grace is the adult, which doesn't take him to the apple, doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple, b- but uh goes along with him, just guiding him, making sure that he he doesn't fall, he just, he lets him get there. But he just more or less, supports or sustains the little tot, in his motion toward the apple. So the little tot you see, Has decided he wants the apple. Once he sees it, uh, then he, he moves toward it. Prevenient grace assists him toward that apple. It doesn't, as I said, it doesn't carry him there, it doesn't go get the apple and bring it to him, he must go to the apple. But he goes sustained by this prevenient grace. And then, if he, if he half way to the apple, if he decides he doesn't want it, if he if he sees something he th- considers more attractive, and he goes off on a tangent, or goes off in a different direction, then you see, then his will has decided that he does not want to cooperate. With prevenient grace. Luther hated that word cooperation. W- particularly in connection with grace. Now Luther's position is, we are dead in trespasses and sin. You see. There is nothing that can come to us, you see now Luther came to his reformation remember, with this fear of the righteousness of God. The righteousness of God. And Luther all through his monastic life, up until around fifteen fifteen, is probably when he made that tower discovery. That so-called Turmerlebnis. The tower experience. Where reading in Romans one seventeen, he read, you know, the j- the just shall live by faith, well, you have to take rea- really read Romans one sixteen first. Um, I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For it is the power of God onto salvation. To everyone that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein, therein, it can only refer grammatically to Gospel, you see. I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For therein. Is the righteousness of God revealed. As it is written. The just shall live by faith. And, when he discovered this, he had read this a hundred times. But this one time when he read it, he said, suddenly it dawned on him. What this meant. And this place in Paul, Luther said, Became for me, the gate of paradise. Es ging mir ein Licht auf. The light broke in on me. And what was this light. That the righteousness of God, is passive righteousness. It's not the righteousness, you see, Luther said, I hated that that phrase righteousness of God. What does righteousness of God mean. Righteousness of God means, God is holy. And I'm a sinner. And I can never stand in his presence. And the gulf between us can never be bridged, and he's gonna cast me into Hell, because of my sin. What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God. So you see he was constantly preoccupied with this thought, of somehow, satisfying the righteousness of God. Through some work. Through some indulgence. Through some prayer. S through- through- through- renunciation. Through fasting. Through vigils. You know, he says, if a monk, if a m- m- uh... if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery, it would have been I. You see..."

25_FOST,"I mean, I mean, if ever a monk, could've gained heaven through his monkery, it would've been I..."
25_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
25_FOST,"Because he d- he did everything, that he thought would, would make God respond sympathetically to him. And and pacify this righteousness. And he was always miserable. And then he discovered, it's nothing that I do. It's what I accept in faith. Namely, the sacrifice of Christ, the vicarious sacrifice of Christ, for my sin on the cross, I reach out, I accept that, as my... and and then the righteousness of God, is imputed to me. It's given to me. The the just shall live by faith. And so, this life in God comes to you not, it's not God, th- this deus absconditus, this concealed God, this angry God, this God who's waiting to throw you into Hell at any minute, that that was the image that Luther had. And now you see, and and and works were associated with this. His works. What do I have to do, what do I have to do to placate him. What do I have to do to please him. And now you see the breakthrough comes. So, Luther, from his point of view, you see, he's coming at it from an angle of a of an Augustinian monk. He's coming at it from that. With this travail of soul. This agony and anguish of looking for this God. So, he is, after this discovery, he is going to detest anything in theology, which smacks of human effort, or human work, sufficient to please God, or to placate God. No. There is nothing you can do to please God. God loves you, he gives you his grace, totally out of his grace, and nothing from your merit. So the human will cannot, you cannot decide to accept God, and his grace. Even the gift of faith. It's interesting in um, in Bonifas, in his book uh, now he's a French Huguenot. So you would expect it. But it's still, it comes in an interesting scene. Where he's in one of the camps. It's in the second world war, he's in the concentration camp in Germany, and it's very, b- it's a beautifully written book. And and he, uh, he's in this scene, in this camp, and, you know, you just wanna give up, a I mean, every day is, you're hanging onto life by your fingernails. And um, he said, every day, we just lived for one day. We lived one day at a time. And then he said it dawned on me, that um, I I prayed, I lifted up my voice to the Lord, we prayed together, and I prayed, and, and he said then it came to me. That what sustains me in this situation, in this concentration camp, what sustains me, is my, my deep faith in God. And then he said, and then it dawned on me, that this deep faith, which I have in God, is not my creation. Well that's interesting, isn't it. This faith was given me. I did not create it, I did not conjure it up, it came to me. It was given to me. That's the testimony of a Huguenot. Inmate in a concentration camp. Well let's take a break... NA"
