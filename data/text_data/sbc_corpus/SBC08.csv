08_REBE,"The. The way that your testimony is coming in, I don't know if I explained this to you on the phone."

08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,"And, then that's when they made the report, and said they were gonna do something about it."
08_REBE,Okay.

08_REBE,And then sat down.
08_RICK,Mhm.

08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,"Masturbated, and then lifted the paper up."
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,"For her to see. And she saw it, in the the reflection."
08_RICK,"N- n-. Oh, the mirror."
08_REBE,Cause she was looking out the window.
08_RICK,That's how I did it too.
08_REBE,Saying I don't want to see this.
08_RICK,"Cause I didn't want to see him, so I looked this way, and you can see it."
08_REBE,Right.
08_RICK,You know.
08_REBE,Cause it turns into the mirror effect.
08_RICK,"Yeah, mhm."

08_RICK,"Yeah, mhm."
08_REBE,"Um, so, anyway."

08_REBE,It c-... it's a carbon copy.
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,"And, um, in that case he's, uhuh he sits through all the testimony, and he just sort of shakes his head, and makes these big gasps, like, you know, we're creating this whole thing against him."

08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,And then started masturbating...
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,So.
08_RICK,"Well see, what it is, it seems like he wants someone more scary, y- I don't know, cause, he would walk up and down the aisles, there was women on the other side, too, but they'd look like, you know, you wouldn't mess with em, but if you're sitting there, you know, trying to mind your own business, or."
08_REBE,Right.
08_RICK,"Look like you can intimidate someone, you know."
08_REBE,Right.
08_RICK,I i-...
08_ARNO,<XX>.

08_REBE,"I think that's, I think he he finds somebody that's isolated."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"And he goes for a certain age group, I think."
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,"Um, and, you know like uhuh, for some reason I think he likes students, or people who look like students."

08_RICK,"N, just kinda looked, and then looked, and then walked."
08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,And then he kept walking. Yeah.
08_REBE,"When he looked at you the first time, was he sort of, looking you up and down, or, did he just look at your seat, what-."

08_REBE,He went through these doors.
08_RICK,"Into it unhunh, into another car."
08_REBE,Oh.
08_RICK,"And then he came back again, and then, I guess that was like another stop, and more people were getting off, and then, that's when he came and sat by me, sat in this seat right here. But, there was someone sitting there too... there was a lady."
08_REBE,You're kidding.
08_RICK,"Unhunh, there was a lady sitting there, but she got up, and she went to another seat."
08_REBE,Ah.
08_RICK,"She, she just went to a different seat."
08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,"You know like, but he was making uh, I don't know how you describe it, you know how you can be like a nuisance to someone."

08_RICK,"No, <XX>."
08_REBE,In these areas.
08_RICK,I don't believe so.
08_REBE,"Okay. Alright. So then, what did he do."
08_RICK,"Um, did the newspaper uh... you know, looking at it, you know, making loud noises, I guess so I think like that or whatever, then, he just kept doing that to the newspaper like that, and then, he went in, and then he just, you can just see him going like this, you know how you have to unzip your pants."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"Or something, like that, and I'm looking through the window... and then he's still making noises with the paper, and then um, I kinda looked, and then I didn't and I kept making like, s uh you know like, you know like I know what you're."
08_REBE,He was making noises like that...
08_RICK,"No, he was making those, you know, the rattling paper."
08_REBE,Unhunh.
08_RICK,"But I was making noises like, you know like, I wanted him to know, I know what you're doing."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"You know I remembered him for a year... from a year ago. And so, then I just kept, you know I just turned, you know, away from him, and I looked in the window, and he just kept hitting the paper... like that, you know. But you know what he was doing."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"He kept hitting the paper, and um, uh, let me see, then one time I just, you know, kinda looked over, and then you can see it. You know, you can see it."
08_REBE,"Had he lifted up the paper in any way, or."
08_RICK,"Yeah, just like, you know, I'm trying to see how a paper goes, likes thi-."
08_REBE,Like this.
08_RICK,"Okay, uhuhuh, like, he has the paper like, like this, just like, you know, moves it. Like that. You know, like that."
08_REBE,Oh.
08_RICK,You know and you can see it.
08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,You know.
08_REBE,Was he looking at you at all during that time.
08_RICK,Yes. The whole entire time.
08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,"I mean, not looking, at first he would go like this, even, with the paper. And look at me. You know, trying to get my attention."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"Like he wanted me to look at him. And, then the whole time under here, he'd just look. I mean, uhuh he looked so hard, that it was like burning, you know what I mean."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,It-...
08_REBE,Tell the jury that.
08_RICK,Okay.
08_REBE,That's. I mean that's great.
08_RICK,"He just, alright... uh."
08_REBE,"Um, Because that's what he does."
08_RICK,Okay.
08_REBE,"And that's his way, of drawing your attention to him."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"Because, if somebody's doing that to you, there's no way you're gonna, you know, just totally ignore them."
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,Cause you're always going to wanna keep them in your peripheral vision...
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,At least.
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_ARNO,Mhm.
08_REBE,To make sure where they are.
08_RICK,"Mhm. Yeah. Cause I was, you know, I didn't know what he was gonna do."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"Or anything, so."
08_REBE,"So, um-, part of our burden is to prove, that he's deliberately doing th-, that he has the specific intent to draw your attention to him."
08_RICK,Okay.
08_REBE,So let them know that he was doing that.
08_RICK,Okay. Alright.
08_REBE,"Um, okay. So then, and then, he sort of pulled the paper aside, and he's still staring at you."
08_RICK,"Yeah. Unhunh still staring and, just, you know, and then, but when uh uh, like you come to a stop, see that's all through the tunnel. You know, that's a long, like about."
08_REBE,Mhm.
08_RICK,"Five minute ride or something. A couple of minutes ride, and we got to like Embarcadero, he would just, you know, go like this, you know, before anyone got on, and wait, and then just do the same thing, until I had to get off at my stop."
08_REBE,"Tell the jury about that too, because that indicates that he knew what he was doing was wrong."
08_RICK,Hm. Oh okay.
08_REBE,And if there was a chance that any man might walk by.
08_RICK,Y-. Mhm.
08_REBE,"You know, I had another case, or, I have a pr- report from another case where, um, he wa-... he was crouched down, and doing it."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"And then when a man would walk by, he'd sit up."
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,"And, you know, do nothing, and then once the man was through the doors, then he'd go back <XX> <XX> doing it."
08_RICK,Yeah. Okay.
08_REBE,"So. Um, okay so then you got off..."
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,At your stop.
08_RICK,Yeah.
08_REBE,"Um, and how were you feeling."
08_RICK,"Well, it was like, s- I don't know, sorry."
08_ARNO,You doing alright.
08_RICK,"Just, I don't know, like disgusted, you know, wh-, why I really wanted to report it this time because, it was like summertime..."
08_REBE,Unhunh.
08_RICK,And the kids. You know the kids and everything.
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"That's what I was scared of, because I know how, uh I was, you know, a victim of, you know, abuse like that or uh, I just, you know, I just, That's what I was think-, the very first time I reported, it was just like this dirty old man, just that that."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"And this time, it was during the summer and there was lots of kids, and um, I just felt like, you know, upset. You know."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"And I just, you know, I just felt upset."
08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,"You know, n-."
08_REBE,"Tell the jury that. Um, it's it's really important that they understand..."
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,The feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you.
08_RICK,Uhuh.
08_REBE,Cause...
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,"My one concern about this case is, um, that some people may have the attitude of..."
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,"Well, he never touched you."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"He didn't make any verbal threats to you, it's no big deal..."
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,"And, especially, I have some young single men, on my jury panel."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"And, uh I... my worry is that they don't relate to what a woman feels, when something like that is happening."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,Because their experience would be totally different... if a man exposes himself...
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,"Which, a man would never do that."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,Because...
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,"Number one they pick out, I think more vulnerable people."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"But if, um, a man were to be exposed to, they would laugh, or, you know, be disgusted."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"Or be mad, but they wouldn't necessarily feel..."
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_JUNE,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,Scared or threatened...
08_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
08_RICK,Unhunh.
08_JUNE,Hi.
08_REBE,Hi.
08_JUNE,Can I sit with you.
08_REBE,"Sure. Um, so r- relate that information to the jury..."
08_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
08_RICK,Okay.
08_REBE,"Okay. Um, and then, uh, so then when you got off, you called the police."
08_RICK,No.
08_REBE,Right.
08_RICK,"I went upstairs to the BART, and told them, and I tried to tell them what train it was, and I just, I was still kind of like shocked, so I I was like, well I have to go, cause I have to make an appointment, but I did tell someone, I said I'll be back to make a report or whatever I had to do, and then there was a different person down there, and, when I called the BART police, they said oh no one's even said anything to us, you know and uh."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"That was that, and then I think, uh, couple of days after, one of the uh, detectives, called me and then I made a report. He wanted to see if I can ID him first, and then, we just made a report and he said, he'll submit it and everything."
08_REBE,Okay... and you ID'ed him immediately...
08_RICK,"Unhunh, he just showed me. He's all okay, come with me, come with me, you know."
08_REBE,"Okay. Alright. I have uh, a- and this is, i- if they make an issue out of it, this is what you looked at. Right."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,Like a folder with different.
08_RICK,"Yeah, yeah, right there."
08_REBE,And I have the one where you signed right underneath it.
08_RICK,"Unhunh, yeah."
08_REBE,"And, we've got the statement where you immediately said I'm hundred percent sure this is the guy."
08_RICK,Mhm. Yeah.
08_REBE,So. Okay.
08_ARNO,What is he a old man.
08_REBE,He's like sixties.
08_RICK,In his. Yeah.
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_ARNO,God.
08_RICK,And he's like balding like.
08_REBE,Yeah. You can come in the courtroom.
08_ARNO,Oh good.
08_RICK,Okay.
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_ARNO,"Um, she has anxiety attacks when she gets excited and."
08_RICK,See that's why I'm s-.
08_ARNO,She gets real nervous and scared.
08_RICK,That's why I am tra-.
08_REBE,Unhunh.
08_ARNO,She has bad anxiety attacks.
08_RICK,I can't breathe.
08_ARNO,She she'll ju-.
08_REBE,Oh really.
08_RICK,That's why I'm trying to.
08_ARNO,"Yeah sh-, That's why she's crying."
08_REBE,Okay.
08_ARNO,So.
08_REBE,"Okay. Um, uh m- how."
08_RICK,"Do I have to look at anyone, just you, or."
08_REBE,"No, you can just look at me."
08_RICK,Okay.

08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"And, sh-... cause she had testified, when he walked in initially and he looked at me, Walter Munson, she said, I I knew he was a pervert, just by the way he looked at me."
08_RICK,Oh.
08_REBE,"So this man walked up to him and he said, I'm standing close to you, I'm looking at you, does that make me a pervert."

08_RICK,Okay.
08_REBE,"He'll be very polite, um."
08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,"He's going to try and focus more on, uh, discrepancies, like if you testify to one thing, and there's something written differently in the report."
08_RICK,Unhunh.
08_REBE,"He might say well, you know, in your..."
08_RICK,<NONVERBAL>
08_REBE,"In the report it says that you, um, you know, he sat down, right across from you."
08_RICK,Mhm.

08_REBE,"Um, what hap-... well tell me about the year ago incident."
08_RICK,"Um, that one was at night time. And, um, I was working late, and it was around, I remember I used to get off ar- around nine, and I used to get to um, the Bart station around ten o'clock. And, he would be uh, I think, I'm trying to think, would he get on, or would he already be on. Well that's the Daly City one, so he would get on, when I would get on, but I think probably like a different car, and, same thing, exact, identical. Go up and down the aisles, but..."
08_REBE,<NONVERBAL>
08_RICK,"I would be the only one in the train. You know, because at night time there's not many people on there, and, he would do that, and I was, I was terrified then, because I was the only one, there was no one around."
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"I, you know, I was a little scared this time but, uh you know, but there's people around, like, you know, I don't think he would do anything, when people are around."
08_REBE,Right.
08_RICK,"You know, down at the other seats or in back."
08_REBE,Right.
08_RICK,I could scream but.
08_REBE,Yeah.
08_RICK,"At night time he was doing the same thing, and I called that night, to the Bart police, and I told them what he looked like, and everything, and, I never heard anything again. So."

08_RICK,Mhm.
08_REBE,So identical.

08_REBE,Okay.
08_RICK,"And then I even told them, I said, and the funny thing is, he just... the only thing he changed this time, is um, he wore a new bow tie, and uh a different bag, cause he always had a bag, cause the, what made the interested in this case, they s- told me, well, everyone's telling me he has this bag, he carries around, and he has a bowtie, like that, and I go."
