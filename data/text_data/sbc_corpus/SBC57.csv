57_NICK,Go get him.
57_X,Little boys' room...
57_BENT,Iai...
57_NICK,God.
57_DARR,No.
57_NICK,That whale got beached.
57_MART,He's not ready for that one.
57_DARR,No.
57_NICK,Now.
57_MART,You know how I.
57_NICK,Alright...
57_X,<XX> <XX>.
57_NICK,Let's us three get together. Us four.
57_DARR,You want the mat.
57_NICK,"Bill, you wanted to learn Hane-makikomi."
57_BILL,Yep... <XX> sensei.
57_NICK,Right.
57_BILL,Right.
57_NICK,"Darren, drag that crashpad to the center of the mats and."
57_X,Bad connection.
57_NICK,"Okay, when I throw you Darren, I'm gonna want you to, slap real hard. Okay, it's gonna be a rather hard fall. This way y'all two can see it."
57_DARR,Oh boy. Okay.
57_NICK,"Well not an oh boy anything, it's."
57_DARR,Oh man.
57_NICK,No you're.
57_DARR,Oh God...
57_NICK,<NONVERBAL>
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,There you go. There you go...
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Didn't you wanted to hurt my new Brown Belt tonight... Alright, take an inside sleeve grip with it. And, go ahead and grip my gi, normally. Darren. Now with the Hane-makikomi, you know how Makikomi, the springing hip works. You jerk em up to you onto your chest."
57_X,Mhm.
57_NICK,Pivot...
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,And then spring em out.
57_DARR,Ow. Fuck.
57_NICK,With their thigh. I mean wi-... with their thigh.
57_BENT,Put your ankles together Darren.
57_NICK,Thigh.
57_DARR,Nope.
57_NICK,And uh calf. Hunh...
57_BENT,<XX> <XX> ankles together.
57_DARR,"Um, actually in this case, this to that, don't do it. I don't recommend it."
57_NICK,We try not. We have a little rank. W- only White Belts do that Darren. That's okay...
57_DARR,Well...
57_NICK,<NONVERBAL>
57_DARR,I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
57_NICK,Okay.
57_X,Okay.
57_NICK,This w- this time you won't get a chance to.
57_DARR,It's gonna be a lot faster isn't it.
57_NICK,"Well, yes and, you're gonna be carrying the weight of both of us when you're on your heels."
57_DARR,Oh okay.
57_NICK,"Alright. Now w-. Just relax. I'm not gonna hurt you at all. Uh, when I do the Mak-... uh the Hane-goshi, instead of pulling him all the way up. Like this, I'm gonna come, and let go with this hand. With my right hand, I'm gonna wrap his right arm up."
57_DARR,Like so.
57_NICK,"Just like this. Just like you would in a regular, Sode-makikomi. Then I'm gonna slam this leg up..."
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,And let fly.
57_DARR,Interesting.
57_NICK,"There's not much difference, I mean, it's a little more dynamic, and it's good, when you catch a bent-over opponent. Out there in shiai... uh Or randori. No need to fix your gi right now. It's gonna get messed up. Bend over for me Darren, No not. Yeah. Bend over like a-. Grab my gi."
57_DARR,Alright.
57_NICK,"From right here, then I come..."
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"I'm doing a. Pardon me. Let me go back to Hane-makikomi, I'm doing Sode. Bend over. I'm just gonna kinda scoop his arms up. Bring it across..."
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Notice how high I get up into his crotch with that foot. That gives me more lift to him. Uh bow. Come here. Bend over. I've got my, my high collar grip on, on a bent-over player. Who likes to watch my feet and mess around. I'm gonna give him something to watch now. I'm gonna come all the way around here, and as I've got him wrapped up, I'm wrapping up tight, aren't I Bill."
57_BILL,Yep.
57_NICK,I'm gonna slam that up...
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"I'm gonna come all the way around on him. See it's okay if I get this foot, all the way up into the side of his crotch. I want to really get that lift. As I get that lift, I wanna get that outer winding pull. That Makikomi. Okay. Let's give it a try. Bill I wanna see you throw Darren. We need to practice Darren's Ukemi... I love it, the only Hebrew I've ever seen make the sign of the cross..."
57_DARR,It takes too long to do the sign of star of David Nick.
57_NICK,Hush...
57_JED,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,Sammy Davis Junior used to do it just fine. Ha-jime.
57_X,Na-.
57_NICK,"Now you gotta let go with the right hand Bill. Get going, wrap around. There, pull. Pull, outer winding pull..."
57_DARR,", And don't elbow me in the face."
57_NICK,Ya-. You need to let him have a chance to slap.
57_DARR,That's good etiquette.
57_BILL,You're right.
57_NICK,"Watch Bill. From here, come all the way around."
57_BILL,Okay.
57_NICK,To here. See how I got him up on that one leg.
57_BILL,Gotta keep that on. Okay.
57_NICK,Then I'm gonna kick his leg up...
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Boom. In a Hane-goshi. That spring hip. With an outer winding pull. It's okay if you hit it low, but if he's bent over, you can-... and you hit it low, you're not gonna hit nothing. From here, I don't have. I have too much distance between us. But from here..."
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,I get more of a spring off with it. It's gonna be hard not to call it an ippon.
57_X,Mhm...
57_NICK,"And even if they don't, I'm going right into Ude-garami. Go..."
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Not bad. Lug, you wanna give it a try. Try it on Bill. You're in front of a Black Belt... <XX> where <XX> he can see if he wants to."
57_DARR,Oh. I'm sorry.
57_NICK,Alright...
57_X,<XX>.
57_NICK,Gotta pull going this way.
57_BENT,Okay. I need to have him here.
57_NICK,"Jerk him. You don't have to g- wrap both arms up. Just one really, uh jerk him around."
57_BENT,"Okay, <XX> and then spring the hip up."
57_NICK,"Spring your hip. Take a high collar grip Lug, if he's bent over that far, you wouldn't start off like that. Now. You can just swing all the way around, and grab that arm."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,Just. No...
57_BENT,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,There's no such thing as a Hane-uchi-mata. You fall straight on your face.
57_BENT,Oh.
57_NICK,"Alright, you don't have the outer pull going for you. You still don't have enough outer pull. He oughtta be wound up on his tiptoes. Way out to here. Now spring your hip."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,Spring your hip...
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"There. It's hard too, for you, w- your legs are so short, and he's so tall. Try it again. And Martin if your hip joints were okay."
57_BENT,Yeah.
57_NICK,"He'd b- be just perfect for you to, okay, for one thing you're backing in."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,"Watch. From here, bend over. From right here."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,Jock him into it.
57_BENT,Mhm.
57_NICK,"I've gotta still jerk him up on his tiptoes to throw him, from here. See that half half instep."
57_BENT,Spot the hip.
57_NICK,"I'm jerking, I still get under him don't I..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Then I'm on him. It's hard to control that throw, Did you land off the mat."
57_BILL,No no.
57_NICK,Good. Uchi- mother. Koka...
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Tell you what. Martin let's pull this down <XX>. Okay. Alright. Lug, Give a more upward, round pull. From here. Watch. I get s-... best- best way to do it is to feel it I guess. Bend over. Alright, I'm gonna come to here, now I jerk up, first, then I spin around."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,"And I'm gonna let it go, God you're heavy... Then I'm gonna let go here, here, see how I got you wound up..."
57_BENT,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,Down here. This is not a good throw to throw Lug in...
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"I would suggest doing this throw, on combatants and opponents of equal height. And size. Lug would be much better, for a Sode-makikomi, but not a Hande-maki- Hane-makikomi. Cause the Hane, you add that spring. Alright, I'm having to use my legs, to throw his weight. Instead of using Sode-makikomi..."
57_BENT,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"And get the outside of his legs, and I can make that a pretty throw. Alright. And with the Makikomi technique with it, you don't have, the Tsuri-komi. The lifting pull... that you would normally have. You don't have your right hand to help you with it. All you have is an outer winding pull with the left hand. It's gotta go up, out, and around. Let's give it a try. Throw throw Bill again..."
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Now, spring the hip..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,That's better.
57_JED,Yeah.
57_NICK,"Much better. Now let's throw it again, and not have to stop, and think about where the foot goes. Now, Just one moment. The more acute angle, that that knee gets at, the more power w- you have with your spring from your hip joint. From here, even if I'm doing Hane-goshi... if I get that, that knee bent, at ninety degrees right here, well I can blast him, from here..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"I've got a lot of spring with it. Also, lay the instep of the foot. Toes extremely well-pointed. To the inside, of his calf, I mean his, his uh thigh, at the bend of his knee. I don't care if your heel slides up into his crotch. For a a Hane-makikomi. Now, uh, Hane-goshi, I'd prefer that you do it a little bit different. But Hane-makikomi, the higher up it gets, the more spring you get. Yoshi."
57_BENT,Is this the right position here.
57_NICK,"Your knees need to be bent. Now pull. Pull pull pull, and spr- and spring. Spring."
57_BENT,Okay. I'm just trying to get this...
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_BENT,This middle position.
57_NICK,"Alright watch... even though he's bent over, I still have to get in."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,I've got to get him loaded. Look at his look at his heels. Is his heel up.
57_BENT,Yes.
57_NICK,"Alright from here, now I've g- I'm got to be lower, come on back side of the hands..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"And then I spring him off. If he's bent over, it's extremely hard for me to get under him, with a standard Tsuri-komi grip. Well this way I'm just scooting my butt in there on him. It doesn't matter if I hit him, a little bit above my- his obi, with my buttocks. As long as, that leg is automatically cocking as it goes in. Then I'm throwing my weight straight forward."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,With that outer winding pull. It's all-important. Jerk him around. In a big circle...
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Okay. Everything was there but the leg. Bill went into Uchi-mata. I might have to have you throw Uchi-mata a couple times, so you can throw a Hane-goshi. Think of it, as a very short, inverted kick. Like that. You know how you can use, inverted kick. Up very close range."
57_BENT,Mhm.
57_NICK,That's exactly what you're doing... Kicking the inside of his thigh.
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,This time do an inverted kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it. Go into it and load him up two or three times. Uchi-komi. Alright. Bend your knees as you go in too. You're just straight and... straight and lock-kneed. There... S better. Now throw...
57_BENT,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,Relax. Relax and throw...
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Better. Better. You're still sliding up that leg, you're not springing it. Bill, let's see you throw a couple times. Throw me... It's hot in here. Thank you..."
57_BILL,Okay it was.
57_NICK,"Now I'm gonna be a sucker, and watch your feet. This. Now you're just walking in on me man, you have- you have no outer winding pull here. Jerk me to you. Hoo, there we go, I'm on my tiptoes, what are you waiting for..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,<NONVERBAL>
57_BILL,Not quite far enough in.
57_NICK,"A little shaky, but basic, as long as you're getting my head, to where it'll clear, and, won't snap my neck, you'll be doing fine. Make me a happy camper, Ah... here, an added exp-... an added attraction. What are we gonna do now. I've got my hand on your hip. Whoa. There we go. That's it beau. Throw..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,", I was gonna get that arm free."
57_BILL,Stop whispering.
57_NICK,Good. Have you played a player yet. One of these. You will.
57_BILL,Think I did...
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Jed, you've seen these, haven't you."
57_JED,Mhm.
57_NICK,"Turn on in on s- with something. Turn in to anything. Ah. Can't, can you. Go into O-uchi. Now I'm playing you back. But."
57_BILL,Okay.
57_NICK,"You can hook that arm, Oh, there we go. Hane-makikomi now... Ow."
57_JED,Alright.
57_NICK,Boy that's a hard fall.
57_JED,Oh.
57_NICK,"Ippon... Alright, that's where Hane-makikomi comes in. Now, the traditional way to do it, is not all bent over. It's from a regular grip. And I'll still go..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,Not a real. Which w- that one wasn't a very clean pretty throw...
57_BILL,<XX> functional.
57_NICK,"Ah f-, well, it would have been better, had my leg stayed lower. Traditional Hane, Hane uh, Goshi leg..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,There.
57_BILL,That was pretty.
57_NICK,"But I like the Hane-makikomi, when it's used on a player, who's fighting you in that, extreme defensive stance. While he's down in a deep jigo. Preferably, with his left foot forward. Pressing against you with that left hand. Keeping you out. Doing this number. Goes in, see he's already eliminated this place, All you have to do is jerk me around to it and come to me. From there. Jerk, Hook, And then spring me right there. That's it. Alright, practice it on Darren a couple times. I wanna see it. Think if you tried the throw."
57_BILL,Okay.
57_X,Can you tell.
57_NICK,On Darren. Lug's a little bit heavy for you.
57_BENT,Where is he-. Here it is.
57_JED,Don't throw him off the mat now Bill.
57_BILL,Do we wanna do it using. Yeah.
57_DARR,Ah the only thing I.
57_NICK,Yeah. Take your position on the mat.
57_DARR,All I do is <XX>... <XX>. I'm keeping you out like that.
57_BILL,Well that's fine down.
57_DARR,Uh Are they on the chalk.
57_BILL,Yes you are.
57_DARR,Okay. You gonna make <XX> <XX>.
57_NICK,Throw...
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Well, it's coming off as a winding Uchi-mata."
57_BILL,"Was I above your leg, It did."
57_NICK,"It's not the time for uh, for uh extreme resistance yet. We're in practice."
57_BILL,Okay.
57_NICK,"Just put your hand up there, and push a little bit..."
57_BILL,<XX>.
57_NICK,"Not a lot of resistance from it. And, <XX> <XX>... <XX> <XX>. Thank you. Cause you're throwing him over toward this edge."
57_BILL,Okay...
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"That's it. Pu-. Ippon. Alright. Lug let's see you throw uh, throw Bill."
57_X,Okay.
57_NICK,Turn and bow to that Brown Belt.
57_DARR,I did.
57_NICK,Okay I didn't see you. Sorry.
57_DARR,He didn't bow to me though.
57_NICK,"Throw, throw from there... That would've been fine... Man that would have been as fine as frog's hair. Throw..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"Nice winding Uchi-mata. The o- the only way that you're gonna get it Lug, is to keep practicing it. Alright, now, hook the arm, hook the arm here. All the way, and just shoot this on across. Release his head, and shoot the arm, straight through. Now go. Throw. Throw..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"There. You're still shooting up, with a bit of a uh, Uchi-mata. Now I'm gonna throw him with left side. Here. It doesn't matter, you can keep your right hand grip. Alright, now I'm just gon- gonna shoot it to here."
57_DARR,Uh.
57_NICK,Now I'm coming in with my knees bent.
57_DARR,Yeah but that makes.
57_NICK,I've got him up.
57_DARR,Yeah but an elbow in my f-.
57_NICK,"Don't worry about it son, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm just doing Komi. And from the right hand side. Bend over. Put your hand against my hip. Hold me out."
57_DARR,Okay.
57_NICK,"Alright from here, he's holding me out. I just come, just like this. See how I shoot this hand down. I don't have to try to grab him around the head. I shoot this hand down and I, I'm gonna follow it. With this shoulder..."
57_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"All I'm doing is my, my roll out then. Then I've got him all locked up, now I'm good and tight against your chest Darren."
57_DARR,"Uh, are you, yeah. Well."
57_NICK,"Am I tight against your chest. Yes, I'm right against your chest. No space between us. One of the secrets about making this throw work. Bend over Bill, put your hand there. Alright from here, I'm gonna roll it around here. See how I got my chest. Have I got your chest Bill."
57_BILL,Yep.
57_NICK,"But my butt is in it, that's okay..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_JED,Oh.
57_NICK,Doesn't matter...
57_JED,Textbook.
57_NICK,"I think about ninety percent of your problem, is the, legs. Try it on me. Up now."
57_X,Uh.
57_NICK,"Alright I'm right here. S- get over here. Alright Lug, swing that arm out of your way. Swing it all the way around. That's fine, see I'm getting my arm out, trying to step over now. I think you're going to go, and do, uh, a m-... a uh, Sode-makikomi. This is just what it feels like from this position. So I'm gonna get ready to step over."
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,"To get away from that Sode-makikomi, I wanna step, so I can drop you with Tani-otoshi."
57_BENT,Right.
57_NICK,"And just as I get ready to step from here, kick that leg in..."
57_BENT,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"There I go. Alright come here Bill, Watch it Darren, I mean uh, Benton. Alright, tell me if this, you know, Sode-makikomi. Now. Ah, there we go, there we go, no, just don't counter, just step over the damn thing. There. Alright now, he stepped over, so..."
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,"I can finish up, with a Hane-makikomi. He off mat."
57_JED,No... he just hit his hand.
57_NICK,"Oh, back of his hand again..."
57_JED,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,<NONVERBAL>
57_JED,"I guess since he's off the mat, he didn't wanna hurt his arms."
57_NICK,"Yeah. He's used to wearing a watch, try and protect it. Come throw him a little bit Benton. There, Now th-, shoot that leg, shoot it now. Ha. You had a perfect position with the foot... <XX>. Jed, can you add anything, cause I'm out here on the."
57_JED,Yes.
57_NICK,"In the front, I can't see what's going on, you're out here, right here on the side..."
57_JED,"<XX> <XX>, I've noticed something that your sensei is doing that you're not doing. He's reaching for the mat. He's in there and winds up."
57_NICK,Yeah.
57_JED,"He's reaching for the mat, with this arm. And your arm's way up here high. You're like way up high off the ground, and your sensei, is way down like this. By the time he gets to the end of the throw. See the difference. So you're wrapping, and you're thinking, I gotta make this throw, what am I gonna do, and Nick, is going for the mat with this arm. He's into a f-, almost like a forward roll mode. The other difference that I noticed between you and your sensei is that, this foot is way out here. This the, your."
57_NICK,Are they trying to throw over the entire hip section.
57_JED,"With th-. Mhm, And and and and, when Nick throws it, so pretty like he does, he's got the, his foot, much closer to the middle, of his opponent's center of gravity..."
57_BENT,Kay.
57_JED,"S- you're so wide that, if you lift up, when you lift up to make the springing motion, what happens is, you fall this way real quick."
57_NICK,That is it.
57_JED,"And you don't have, enough to go like that. Try it one time. Reach for the ground with your wrapping arm, Uh uh uh..."
57_BENT,<NONVERBAL>
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_NICK,Better there.
57_JED,Yeah. It's better. Reach.
57_NICK,But.
57_JED,"Reach, reach way into the ground with this one..."
57_NICK,"<XX>, Here here here's... it's right here."
57_JED,Reach way like this. Like you were doing a front roll out...
57_NICK,<XX>.
57_JED,"And and stand on this foot, so that you, are more balanced. Just a little bit more, but you- you're going down. I mean."
57_NICK,"Step in when you have his b-, right between his legs. No step deeper."
57_JED,Won't settle.
57_NICK,Step deeper.
57_BENT,Okay.
57_NICK,Look how d-. Now. Get your foot over here.
57_X,Bit more.
57_NICK,Step right between his legs.
57_BENT,That foot.
57_NICK,"Now, shoot your arm and, and kick."
57_JED,Oh.
57_NICK,"Ho, Hane-makikomi."
57_X,Woo.
57_BENT,Ah so...
57_NICK,"Try it again. Alright, you notice the difference in the foot position, what- hi-... what... how much that helped."
57_BENT,Mhm.
57_NICK,"Step directly between his legs, with your advancing foot. No no no no no."
57_BENT,Ah.
57_NICK,"You're not, not between his legs."
57_JED,Now reach that arm. Reach that arm.
57_NICK,Shoot it.
57_JED,Reach that arm through...
57_BILL,<NONVERBAL>
57_JED,"The more you reach that arm through, L- let me add one-. Let me add one thing to it, to make it... cause it is a hard fall if you're, throwing it contest style, if you're throwing it demo style, somebody once told me, that that, the way to practice, all the Makikomi-waza, was to go down like this. To take this foot if you're throwing right-hand throws, and to take this foot, and stick it all the way through like this."
57_NICK,Yep.
57_JED,"And just stick it. All the way, behind you, like this. And as you go down, uh and you roll like that. Okay, and if you do this, in demo, uh in demo fashion, you'll be so low to the ground, by the time that your opponent hits the ground, that you'll be real nice to him. And that way I mean, you can intensify, you can always intensify throwing... throw it harder. But the mark of a good judo throw, is to be able to, do you see the people throw Seoi so nice, they can do... they could throw their grandmother, and it doesn't even hurt. She goes ah. That felt good. So you can do that."
57_NICK,Mm.
57_JED,"By sticking that leg, all the way through, just like that. As you get. You follow what I'm saying."
57_BENT,Yes sir.
57_NICK,You don't have to drive em through the mat.
57_JED,"That, that's a way that you can, practice it over and over, in a demo style, and be so low to the ground, that it's a real nice, it's about as good as you can get a Makikomi for your uke. It's really not that bad. And you could... it's it's."
57_NICK,"Throw him, and let him see."
57_JED,"Alright, Alright, S- so we're coming over like this, coming in like this..."
57_X,<NONVERBAL>
57_JED,Alright.
57_NICK,Nice easy clean fall. Look how tight he is to my chest. Look at his body position right here. There is no. You couldn't slide a postcard between us.
57_BENT,I don't think you'd even do it between the hip-... to- to- get the hips.
57_JED,Well do you wanna do one more.
57_NICK,<NONVERBAL>
