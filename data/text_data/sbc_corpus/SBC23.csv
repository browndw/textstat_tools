23_EVEL,"Another thing I thought was interesting, was the, this uh, the emphasis on transportation. Do you remember the automobile. This was the beginning of the uh change."
23_LIND,Mhm...
23_PATT,<XX> <XX>...
23_EVEL,"uh trains, and uh."
23_PATT,Carriages.
23_EVEL,Automobiles.
23_LIND,Unhunh.
23_EVEL,And uh.
23_X,Hm.
23_PATT,I think Margaret though.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,"I- uh. I don't think we can underestimate her. I mean, I think she's a like a lot of women, that I have known. I mean she's in control..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"There is no doubt. I mean, Henry Wilcox may think he's in control, but he isn't."
23_X,Hm.
23_PATT,And there would never be a Jacky Bast...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"While she is uh the head of of that h- household. Whereas I thought Missis Wilc-... the first Missis Wilcox, Ruth."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,"Was so other worldly, and everything else."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,"She didn't even have a clue, as to what was going on."
23_X,Mhm.
23_PATT,"So I felt that, that uh Margaret is..."
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"Is, and I thought for this time, she was tremendously, uh, just in charge."
23_LIND,She's very practical.
23_PATT,Yeah.
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_PATT,"And she didn't care, the- to b-... to... she didn't care about emancipation."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,I mean.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,She was.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,"So she... when you really are already that way, you don't have to make a big to-do about it."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_X,Mhm.
23_DIAN,But she also-.
23_LOIS,"I thought also, in the movie, she had a very strong personality. A lot of charisma."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_LOIS,And very positive.
23_DEBO,Did you see the movie Diane.
23_DIAN,Hm-m.
23_LOIS,Which is also what you're saying. But.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_LOIS,But she just radiated something which was personality.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"You know, a funny... there are two young people that I have talked to about the movie, and I haven't seen it but, one of them, uh was my niece, and I said something about Margaret talking about her, feeling that she was the, I think I used the word heroine. And she said heroine. And she couldn't see Margaret as a heroine. I think Margaret..."
23_X,<XX>.
23_EVEL,"And then she went on, to explain, she said, maybe she was too strong. Uh, we're used to seeing someone as the uh, you know, the protagonist, or the, the woman on the screen, as a romantic, as uh all of that, And I. I haven't seen the movie, but that was her feeling about it."
23_X,Hm.
23_LIND,Hunh.
23_SUE,Had she read the book also. You.
23_EVEL,No... no.
23_SUE,T-.
23_LIND,Just the-.
23_EVEL,No.
23_SUE,Because-...
23_EVEL,<XX> goes to movies.
23_SUE,Okay...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,And an-.
23_SUE,"Be-. Because, the other thing about Margaret that would be uh- a heroine, is that she..."
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,"Marries Henry even though all this has happened... and then she, she sticks with Henry."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_SUE,"Even though, all, You know..."
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_SUE,The son ends up killing...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,You know...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,"All this happens, and she sticks it out with Henry..."
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,Yeah.
23_SUE,"And that, maybe, young people nowadays wouldn't have done..."
23_EVEL,<XX>...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,"They wouldn't have thought that heroic. They would have thought that, marching out and saying I won't stay, you know or."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_SUE,I won't marry you or...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,Whatever.
23_EVEL,MM.
23_LIND,"I- I wanted to know, excuse me. I wanted to know what you thought about, why she agreed to marry him to begin with. Because although I understand the reasons that are given in the book, I still couldn't quite decide that, that's something she would have decided to do."
23_EVEL,"Uh but I n-. I know what you mean. The only thing I was thinking, maybe she was older. Her chances were, You know, it was changing."
23_LIND,Mm.
23_EVEL,"And uh, because she was very pleased when he asked her."
23_JANI,Ha-.
23_LIND,"And she admired him, according to the b-."
23_EVEL,Mm.
23_JANI,Well I don't think Henry was the horrible person that.
23_LIND,But.
23_JANI,"Uh, a lot of critics felt that he was, I think maybe Forster wanted him to be that way, and I just didn't look at it that way."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_JANI,When I read about him. But I thought he had a lot of good qualities.
23_LIND,Did you see some charm there.
23_JANI,Mhm.
23_SUE,Hm...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Okay.
23_JANI,Mhm.
23_LIND,Hm. This is for the movie.
23_X,She evidently did. Uhuh.
23_JANI,Mhm.
23_LORI,Well the book she kept saying he was charming.
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_JANI,Well I read the book too.
23_LORI,I mean he.
23_JANI,And I.
23_LORI,"He r-... he uh, she described him as a charming."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_LORI,"When she was talking about him to somebody, Helen or th-, in her thoughts or something, Margaret said, you know he, I mean Mister Wilcox is a charming man."
23_EVEL,Hm.
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_JANI,Hm. Well as long as things are going his way.
23_LIND,I guess I couldn't see any charm. Either place...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,"And, and I. I guess that's what kept kinda s- bringing me up short on..."
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Believing this marriage.
23_EVEL,"After all... or, and the times too, Linda, you know nineteen ten."
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"There wasn't a great deal of opportunity, for a uh."
23_DIAN,"I was gonna say, didn't she think she really had to be married."
23_EVEL,I don't know...
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,But she.
23_JANI,Well the-.
23_LIND,I don't know.
23_JANI,The thing I didn't understand is.
23_LIND,I don't know.
23_JANI,Why both families were so against Paul and Helen...
23_LORI,and then the rest of em <XX>.
23_JANI,"And yen-... then Hen- Henry and Margaret got married, and there didn't seem to be any dissension there."
23_LIND,Well the her-.
23_JANI,You know.
23_LIND,His kids didn't like that.
23_JANI,"No, his kids didn't like it, but Henry was against."
23_X,But.
23_SUE,But the.
23_EVEL,Well Paul had no future.
23_SUE,But the. Yeah but that was.
23_EVEL,Y he had no money.
23_LIND,Paul hadn't made his money... um.
23_EVEL,"Or anything, and uh."
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_JANI,I thought it was mainly because of the difference in the families...
23_NORA,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,"Though, that they, perhaps I misunderstood that."
23_LIND,I don't know.
23_SUE,I.
23_LIND,I don't know that either.
23_SUE,I uh I agree more with Linda... that... that I think it was a situation where Paul couldn't marry anybody...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,Because he had to go uh overseas.
23_JANI,He didn't have any money.
23_SUE,"And make his f-... you know, make his way in the world, cause he couldn't support a woman."
23_JANI,Mhm.
23_SUE,"And, and maybe, those families see, rather than the Basts, who would get married, whether they could support somebody or not, they strongly felt that you had to have a certain amount of money, or, or a certain future in order to... end up."
23_LORI,Position.
23_SUE,Yeah. Position in order to have a wife.
23_LORI,Ready to go.
23_LIND,Mm. Did Helen not have enough money to support them I wonder...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Why couldn't Helen have just supported them.
23_SUE,"Well, I think that that was."
23_LORI,That wasn't.
23_SUE,They... they wouldn't have allowed that.
23_LIND,That's not a.
23_LORI,The Wilcoxes wouldn't have.
23_SUE,That wouldn't have been alright...
23_LORI,Look at Missis Wilcox <XX>.
23_SUE,According to the Wilcoxes.
23_EVEL,The- the- the-... their code of honor. Remember... the uh.
23_SUE,Yeah.
23_EVEL,"Strong English honor, that they uh, that Charles had to defend."
23_PATT,Men would take care of them.
23_EVEL,You know.
23_PATT,Right...
23_KIM,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,Except in Out of Africa.
23_KIM,"When uh Margaret uh, when Margaret married uh Mister Wilcox."
23_DIAN,Which is about the same time...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_X,Mhm.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_KIM,"What-... uh did uh... it seems to me <XX> in the movie, they were looking at this big house, interior of this big house, did they move to a big house. Where did they live."
23_JANI,I think they lived in the big house.
23_KIM,They did live in the big house.
23_JANI,They ended up living in Howard's End.
23_LIND,For a while.
23_JANI,Didn't they.
23_PATT,No.
23_LIND,"Yeahl, at the end. They were in Howard's End."
23_LORI,Who was at Howard's End at the end. I thought it was Helen and the little boy.
23_LIND,"No, all of em were at Howard's End."
23_JANI,I thought all of em...
23_DIAN,<XX>.
23_LORI,They all lived in Howard's End.
23_LIND,"Henry, Margaret."
23_DIAN,Buffalo.
23_LIND,"Helen, they were all one big happy family."
23_LORI,Whole family.
23_PATT,Oh my God...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_KIM,W- when uh.
23_JANI,"That was kind of unbelievable, wasn't it..."
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,Tell me another one.
23_EVEL,And Margaret brought em all together.
23_LIND,Well.
23_KIM,And when they married.
23_LIND,And the other thing.
23_KIM,"And when uh they married, did uh, uh what was his name, the uh wimpy little son."
23_X,Tibby.
23_KIM,The bro-.
23_SUE,Tibby.
23_KIM,"Did Tibby, and the young girl come and live with them."
23_LIND,Tibby.
23_JANI,I don't know what happened to Tibby.
23_LIND,Tibby was.
23_JANI,I don't remember from the book.
23_SUE,Well.
23_LIND,Tibby wasn't there.
23_SUE,"When when he- they-... at the wedding, see, is when Helen, uh, conceived, and so then, shortly thereafter, she me- went away. She went to like, Germany."
23_JANI,Germany.
23_SUE,Or some place like that. And she stayed in Germany.
23_LORI,Okay.
23_LIND,Oh.
23_SUE,Until.
23_LORI,Friend of t-.
23_JANI,"But that wasn't Margaret's wedding, that was Evie's wedding. That was before they got married."
23_SUE,Okay.
23_LIND,Yeah. That's right.
23_SUE,That was before Margaret even got married.
23_LIND,Right.
23_SUE,So by the time Margaret gets married...
23_JANI,Maybe they didn't live there the whole time.
23_SUE,"Helen's pregnant, and she's away somewhere."
23_PATT,Tibby was gone.
23_SUE,Because she isn't.
23_EVEL,Yeah.
23_SUE,She's hiding...
23_JANI,I see.
23_SUE,Essentially...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LOIS,Isn't it also basically a woman's... the women are much more developed characters than the men...
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_LOIS,And the men tend to be.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_LOIS,Not such good people.
23_LIND,Yeah. I think so.
23_KIM,Isn't that interesting.
23_PATT,Weak.
23_KIM,An-... that he would write that way if he was a homosexual.
23_DIAN,Except he was raised by his mother.
23_LOIS,I don't know that everybody agrees with that.
23_DIAN,And.
23_LOIS,But.
23_DIAN,Aunt and so on.
23_LORI,"Yeah, so the- the mo-."
23_KIM,Pardon.
23_LORI,"The mothers have always been uh, women figures in his life were so strong obviously."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_KIM,Uh Bu- but but the fellow.
23_LORI,Isn't that what you're saying.
23_KIM,Tibby... is... was- isn't that is name. He- but he was such a wimpy.
23_NANC,Mhm... sure.
23_KIM,"Physically weak, uh person. Uh."
23_EVEL,They all had asthma.
23_LORI,I wouldn't know who-... they always.
23_X,Hm.
23_EVEL,And uh.
23_LORI,And Paul wasn't.
23_EVEL,"Even living on the farm, they all had uh."
23_LORI,Hm... even Charles wasn't.
23_PATT,Diane.
23_EVEL,"What was it, hay fever, or asthma or something..."
23_X,<XX>.
23_LIND,Yes.
23_PATT,Diane started to say something about Out of Africa.
23_LIND,Yes.
23_DIAN,"Well, you're talking about the woman having the money, and why th- m- a man couldn't."
23_LIND,Mhm. Mhm.
23_LORI,Marry her.
23_DIAN,Marry the.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,"Y- yeah, in uh Out of Africa, I think, is about this same time period. Or may- well maybe it's s- second world war. But Isak Dinesen."
23_LORI,Later.
23_DIAN,"The heroine of out of Africa is Danish, but she's the one with money, and she ends up... a-... the brother of the person that she's in love with marries her."
23_LIND,"Yeah, yeah."
23_DIAN,"Because he has no money, no family money, but she has money, and she has no way to get a husband, so they agree to get married, because he will then have access to her money and title, and she'll have a husband. So it was done, my point of all that was..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,"That it was sometimes done, that a woman of means, married a man of no means, as uh, an arrangement for what ever reason."
23_LIND,Yeah I.
23_DIAN,And so it could have been that this.
23_LIND,I guess.
23_DIAN,That her money could have been the s- source of marriage if they'd wanted it to be.
23_LIND,"That's to me uh uh, kind of a m-... not taken care of, very well in the book. I I guess I don't know why they didn't."
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_LIND,Why that was such a no no...
23_DIAN,"And I didn't realize Forster grew up with money. That sort of mixed me all up now too, because."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,It sounded to me like he hadn't and.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,"Yeah. I have a question about England in nineteen ten, too. Which shows that my lack of history. Was England the strong world power in nineteen ten... still. The w- empire, English, the sun never sets on the English empire."
23_EVEL,Tha- that was where uh.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"A- a- Wilcox made his money. Wasn't it. In s-... what was it. Some kind of trade in uh, I g- I've forgotten what it was."
23_LIND,Hm.
23_EVEL,Uh was it.
23_JANI,"He had, I think he had rubber tr- plantations."
23_EVEL,Rubber plantations...
23_X,<XX>.
23_PATT,Yeah.
23_DIAN,Cause I read Passage to India...
23_LORI,<XX>.
23_DIAN,"A hundred years ago in college, and that was all about the colony of India."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,And English colonial things.
23_LORI,Mhm.
23_DIAN,"So I thought England was in a position of great strength, in nineteen ten."
23_EVEL,I think it was.
23_X,Hm.
23_JANI,I think it probably was...
23_MANY,<XX>.
23_NORA,I think it was...
23_MANY,<XX>.
23_LORI,But it was getting ready to.
23_LIND,But the winds of change.
23_LORI,Move away...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,That's right.
23_DIAN,Were beginning to blow.
23_LIND,Had begun to blow...
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_NORA,Wonder who was the ruler...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_NORA,In nineteen ten.
23_DIAN,Who was the king or queen.
23_NORA,Mhm.
23_LORI,I don't know.
23_DIAN,Hmm.
23_PATT,When... what was Victoria's reign.
23_NORA,Well that's what I'm trying to think of.
23_EVEL,"About, well close to that, w-... uh, remember, they uh."
23_LORI,Well when did Edward give up.
23_EVEL,Upstairs Downstairs.
23_DEBO,I should think it would have been George the Fifth <XX>.
23_EVEL,The uh.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Mm.
23_EVEL,Uh.
23_LOIS,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"What was it, uh the, her son came in..."
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,In about nineteen ten.
23_LIND,Yeah <XX>.
23_EVEL,Victoria's son.
23_LIND,Was that Edward.
23_EVEL,The one that. Yeah.
23_LIND,The ward in a England.
23_EVEL,"The one who was a, such a."
23_NORA,Well he was weak. Wasn't he.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_LORI,The one that abdicated.
23_SUE,Yeah.
23_LIND,No.
23_LORI,That was later.
23_PATT,No. That was later.
23_EVEL,Mhm...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"Well at the beginning of World War One, in The Guns of August."
23_NORA,It was nineteen eighteen.
23_PATT,They.
23_NORA,Fourteen...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"All of the crowned heads, was... that was the last time they were all together. So it had already... was, well over the horizon into setting..."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,By nineteen fourteen.
23_LORI,AOkay.
23_MANY,Mhm.
23_LORI,So nineteen ten it just.
23_PATT,So in nineteen ten.
23_X,Mhm.
23_PATT,There would definitely have been.
23_LORI,Undercurrents.
23_PATT,The winds of change beginning to.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Okay.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,"But England really didn't start losing her colonies, did she, until more like second world war."
23_EVEL,That's when they div- divested.
23_DIAN,Well maybe.
23_LIND,Mhm. Mhm.
23_EVEL,Was after r- Second World War.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Okay.
23_LORI,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Maybe the power over them was becoming weak...
23_EVEL,<XX>. Mhm.
23_LORI,I uh.
23_DIAN,By this time.
23_LORI,"Wasn't that part of the problem they had. Cause they were trying to, hold the colonies together, and then they also had to deal with the war in Europe."
23_PATT,I thought so.
23_LORI,I mean wasn't that the problem.
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_LORI,That they had to be.
23_PATT,"Was that World War Two, or World War One."
23_LORI,"I don't know. I don't know. But I think that was part of the problem, because they couldn't be."
23_DEBO,"More World War Two, <XX>."
23_LORI,Was it Two. Deborah.
23_KIM,I think.
23_LORI,Yeah.
23_DEBO,"I think more, more was World War Two."
23_LIND,"Well they were transferring the power in India, weren't they."
23_LORI,To be in the thirties.
23_LIND,"Uh, more like World War Two."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_LIND,I mean Neru.
23_PATT,When Gandhi.
23_LORI,So the thirties and forties maybe.
23_LIND,Was.
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_JANI,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"Time of Gandhi, and all of that."
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_LIND,Unhunh.
23_HARR,Unhunh.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_JANI,It was kind of interesting to read these uh.
23_DIAN,Hm.
23_JANI,Critical reviews. I got this out of the book review digest... since it was written in nineteen ten. Reviews were written in nineteen ten...
23_EVEL,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Hm...
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,Hunh.
23_JANI,Here's one.
23_NORA,When was the book written...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Nineteen ten.
23_DIAN,Nineteen ten.
23_LIND,"It was published, yeah."
23_JANI,"Published in nineteen ten. Um, Mister Forster, this is from the New York Times... in nineteen. February nineteen eleven..."
23_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Mister Forster seems to write conventional comedy... for that his sense of character values is entirely adequate...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,"While there his blith- blithe manner, and journalistic uh wittiness of phrase serves him well. But he invinces neither power nor inclination, to come to grips with any vital human problem..."
23_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Which totally disregre-... disagrees with everything we've been saying this afternoon...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,But what a different wording of a review...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,Too. It's so proper.
23_LIND,Yes.
23_EVEL,Mm.
23_JANI,Yeah.
23_LIND,True.
23_DIAN,And stilted.
23_MANY,Unhunh.
23_DIAN,And.
23_SUE,Yeah.
23_LIND,True...
23_LORI,<XX>...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,"Saturday review said, whether one likes it or not..."
23_LORI,<XX>...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Howard's End is a real novel...
23_X,<XX>.
23_JANI,That was in nineteen ten...
23_SUE,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,"And, something that, uh it was abbreviated capital SPEC..."
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,I don't know what it was...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,"But if his defects are exasperating, his qualities are remarkable. Vivid characterization, a happy command of dialog, and a f-... and a freakish humor. The clash of modern culture."
23_X,Hm.
23_JANI,And modern materialism...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,"Has seldom found, a more vivid interpreter..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Oh.
23_X,I've never seen that.
23_DIAN,Does the library have these magazines on microfilm.
23_SUE,Oh my.
23_DIAN,Clear back to nineteen ten...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Well this is from the Book Review Digest. So they have all of these little reviews.
23_LIND,Ah.
23_NORA,Oh I didn't know they had that at-.
23_JANI,On this one page.
23_LIND,Uhuh.
23_JANI,That they've collected.
23_NORA,That early.
23_DIAN,Oh.
23_JANI,Of...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"Oh, My."
23_JANI,Of his book.
23_PATT,I didn't... haven't seen that...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,But Janice. You did an awful lot of research on it.
23_NORA,Cause I took that uh.
23_EVEL,I mean those reviews...
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_EVEL,That was wonderful.
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_JANI,Well I didn't spend too much time putting it together.
23_SUE,But.
23_EVEL,Yeah...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,But modern...
23_LORI,<XX>.
23_SUE,"Modern culture, and modern materialism, I mean that's essentially what we're saying."
23_EVEL,That's what we've been saying.
23_LIND,That's right.
23_SUE,Culture.
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_SUE,And materialism.
23_LIND,That's right.
23_JANI,That's right.
23_SUE,"So, So they."
23_JANI,That was.
23_SUE,Even there they hit it on the head.
23_LIND,Uh.
23_JANI,That's right.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_SUE,The the humor we're having a little trouble with though.
23_JANI,That's right.
23_LORI,Yeah I...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,<XX> the humor.
23_SUE,Well...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,"Although, it was..."
23_X,<XX>.
23_SUE,"There were-... there were times when it w-... it was under- underlying humor, a little bit."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_SUE,You know.
23_DIAN,English humor.
23_SUE,"The-. The like... like the t-... in the movie at least, that, when the Basts come to the, to the wedding reception, and, and."
23_LOIS,Oh yes.
23_SUE,"Jacky, sits down there and starts shoveling in the food, and drinking the drinks, and it's really. It's funny until then they have the confrontation with Henry."
23_EVEL,Right.
23_SUE,And then it isn't funny anymore.
23_EVEL,Right.
23_LIND,Mm.
23_SUE,But it is kind of humorous.
23_EVEL,"Well I... uh I was gonna tell you of the one oth-... the other, uh young person, that I talked to about the book, was a former student, who is now a psychiatrist, who lives in California. We were talking about the book, or about the movie. He hadn't read the book. He said, it was a good movie, but not a great movie. And he said it was without passion."
23_LIND,Oh my.
23_X,Hm.
23_DIAN,Hm.
23_EVEL,"So, Now."
23_X,"Oh, good heavens."
23_EVEL,What do you make of that. I don't know w-...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,M.
23_JANI,I think that's typical of English movies.
23_DIAN,He definitely wouldn't like Michael <XX>.
23_EVEL,Well.
23_JANI,That's.
23_EVEL,Uh uh yeah...
23_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,I I really do.
23_EVEL,"I thought, uhuh. I thought, and I think I said, well, maybe it was because it was English. They are."
23_LIND,Unhunh.
23_EVEL,It's all kind of uh.
23_LIND,I don't know how you can say it's without passion...
23_EVEL,"<XX>, I didn't think so either."
23_LIND,I mean.
23_EVEL,But I didn't argue.
23_PATT,"Well the passion of Leonard Bast, and and Helen, and then the passion of Charles, and the confrontation with Leonard."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_LORI,No but that's tragedy. That's not necessarily passion.
23_LIND,The-. Well what uh.
23_PATT,NO but it was <XX>...
23_LIND,<XX> what are we talking about passion.
23_EVEL,Well I think it.
23_LIND,Let's define passion.
23_EVEL,Well <XX> I think how we define it...
23_DEBO,<XX> passion means to <XX>.
23_EVEL,Yeah. Passion.
23_MANY,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"I think probably he meant, well, trong feeling."
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_EVEL,Not sex.
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_LORI,Mhm.
23_EVEL,But more strong feeling.
23_LORI,Mhm.
23_LIND,Look at Margaret's uh.
23_SUE,Well certainly there wasn't passion between Henry and Margaret.
23_DIAN,Yeah there was.
23_EVEL,No.
23_LIND,Oh yes there was.
23_DIAN,No.
23_EVEL,But strong feelings.
23_JANI,But.
23_SUE,Strong. Well.
23_JANI,Strong feeling.
23_SUE,Strong feeling.
23_JANI,I mean it isn't.
23_SUE,But not passionate.
23_LORI,I don't think there's strong feelings in this book that much... uh only for Howard's End.
23_JANI,Ruth had.
23_LORI,"Uh Ruth had strong feelings for Howard's End, and it didn't do her one bit of good, because it-... her bequest was ignored, and the rest of the people are just kind of floating along."
23_LIND,Oh no no no no no...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,"See, I don't get that."
23_LIND,Helen has tremendous passion about her beliefs. Margaret's speech to Henry.
23_LORI,"Well about her beliefs, but they don't make one bit of difference, in the whole world."
23_LIND,Margaret's speech to Henry...
23_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Is one of the most passionate things I have ever read.
23_LORI,Well I found that part <XX>.
23_LIND,I thought.
23_EVEL,"She mowed him down, didn't she."
23_XEVE,I thought it was beautiful.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_LIND,"And later it says, she thought back over that, and she wouldn't have changed a word of it..."
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,"Absolutely, oh I think there was a lot of feeling, a lot of feeling."
23_DIAN,Was this novel popular when it was published.
23_EVEL,"Uh, according to the professor..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,"That it is a classic of change. It is w- uh one of the uh, classic novels, that has to do with change."
23_LIND,But did the people like it.
23_JANI,Tradition and change.
23_LIND,When they read it. Back then.
23_EVEL,I would imagine that he was popular with <XX>.
23_NORA,Well is it being revived now.
23_LIND,I think he was popular.
23_EVEL,Or.
23_DIAN,Seems to be.
23_KIM,"Well, in the introduction it said."
23_LIND,I don't know.
23_KIM,That in the forties.
23_NORA,They are doing that with so many of those now.
23_KIM,"When they w-... you had uh, Fitz- uh gerald, and uh."
23_LORI,Hemingway.
23_KIM,"And other well-known writers, uh, Hemingway and Faulkner, and, and yet this guy was still up there in the forties. And this book was written in nineteen ten. I didn't care for it. I... well you know what turned me off. The the hi- the big description about the dumb old umbrella."
23_XKIM,"And did the umbrella have uh, a smooth end on it."
23_KIM,Or did it have a knobby end...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_KIM,"And I thought, for crying out, why am I sitting wasting my time reading about umbrella hands..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,and then Helen says.
23_KIM,"And, and the description of the music."
23_SUE,"Oh, we gr-... we steal umbrellas all the time."
23_KIM,And <XX> <XX> <XX>.
23_LORI,We steal em all the time...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,That was part of the humor.
23_KIM,There's got to be something better to read...
23_SUE,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,Hunh...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Now that was supposed to be part of the...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,I did. I did not enjoy.
23_KIM,Was that supposed to be humor. I- I-.
23_JANI,That's English humor.
23_DEBO,Did you enjoy it.
23_LIND,Somewhat.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_LIND,Or at least Helen and Margaret's humor.
23_JANI,I did not enjoy reading the book...
23_DIAN,<XX> above average.
23_LIND,That was their humor.
23_MANY,Mhm.
23_DEBO,I just couldn't <XX>.
23_JANI,But I enjoyed the movie.
23_DEBO,Couldn't quite get into it...
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_JANI,I think that helped me appreciate the book.
23_LORI,"Well Evelyn helped me stay with the book. Because she said it was written in a different time, and of course it's British, and so, because I was having trouble getting started. I got hung up..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,"And it doesn't make any difference, but, uh when you were reading the review, you talked about the affair between Helen and Paul, did I get the right names, And I thought, all that happened was."
23_LIND,Was a kiss.
23_LORI,He...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,"He kissed her, and, and they had."
23_SUE,I thought so too.
23_LOIS,I thought so too.
23_LORI,"And they had this, and they had this understanding of the souls."
23_JANI,"Oh, yes."
23_LORI,That they were in love.
23_LIND,Yeah. I think that's true.
23_LORI,And...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,"And I'm thinking, what is the big deal about this. This aunt is coming down here..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,Everybody's getting in an uproar...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,"Because somebody thought they liked somebody. I... you know, I got lost in that, and, I talked to Evelyn, and she said now y- just stay with it, it's written in a different time, and I thought okay, a different time, yes, maybe that is important..."
23_EVEL,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,You know...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LORI,Come on.
23_LIND,Well Lori...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Did you see the movie.
23_LORI,"So, No, I'm going to rent it. After I leave here today."
23_LIND,See I think. I think it's better to see the movie first...
23_EVEL,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,I am too Lori.
23_LIND,And then read the book.
23_LORI,I think it'll help.
23_LIND,I think it.
23_LORI,"I think, Well, and it's getting a little f-."
23_EVEL,M.
23_LIND,It's a good way to do it.
23_LORI,"You know, I'm getting more into the characters..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,Well.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_PATT,One time in this group...
23_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"And I think it was, I don't remember if it was Evelyn or Deborah. But it was probably... it was one of those people who are so knowledgeable..."
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"It wasn't, was..."
23_EVEL,Oh.
23_PATT,Certainly wasn't any of us.
23_LORI,Might have been Nora.
23_EVEL,Come on. Tell me about it...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"He. He talked, uh They talked about what makes a classic..."
23_LIND,", Oh."
23_PATT,And they had several criteria.
23_LORI,Oh.
23_PATT,And I've forgotten some of them...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Oh.
23_PATT,"But the ones I can think of, is that it has to be able to be read on many levels."
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_PATT,And I think that this is one of those books.
23_LIND,This one does.
23_PATT,"That you can read, as just a story about these people who are wanting to- to live at this Howard's End, or you can read it as the clash between the intellectual, and the practical, or between England and Germany. Which is really what they're getting down to was the basis of that."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_X,Mhm.
23_LORI,That was something.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_PATT,"It can be read at any time, it can apply to England in nineteen ten, or it can apply to America in nineteen ninety-three, with how far are we going to go with entitlements..."
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"How much are we going to take from the uh, so called really wealthy, who's the only people that's going to be touched by this budget..."
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,"Yeah, how nice."
23_PATT,"And all of these things, and give to these poor."
23_DIAN,You forg-...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,I mean even the.
23_DIAN,"You forgot the corporate income tax which is going up and up and up and up and up, and if somebody says entitlements one more time I'm gonna scream."
23_PATT,"Okay, I won't say that."
23_DIAN,Why are these entitlements.
23_PATT,I won't say that.
23_DIAN,Why are you entitled to this.
23_KIM,The corporate income tax is going to be raised one percent...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_KIM,And so therefore the g- big corporations in the U S are backing this budget change in Washington.
23_PATT,"Well, at any rate, I think there's..."
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,That is as...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,"As typical today, I mean as topical today as it was then. And then it has to deal, with the big questions. Uh the-... of moral values, and of w- how you uh perceive the world."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,And all of this with it. And I... there were some others. And I can't even remember what they all were. But I.
23_DIAN,"I know, but it was Evelyn who did it, and we ought to make her get her notes out again. Because sh-."
23_PATT,Yes...
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_PATT,If you can find this.
23_LOIS,She probably remembers...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_JANI,Uh Evelyn.
23_EVEL,I don't remember.
23_JANI,Will you do that again sometime.
23_EVEL,Oh...
23_JANI,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,I will remember. I just I just can't remember what it was.
23_PATT,"But I thought there were five, and I've only come up with four..."
23_LIND,Hm.
23_NORA,I thought she had five.
23_LIND,"Oh, I only heard three. What was the."
23_NORA,Let's.
23_PATT,"The. Well the eternal truths, at any time, on any level."
23_LIND,Oh eternal truths.
23_PATT,Yeah.
23_LIND,I missed the eternal truth.
23_PATT,"At any time, on any level, and by any age."
23_LORI,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"Uh, well you didn't mention one thing, I thought it was very interesting, and I thought you all w- i- who are married, would have picked up on it, the relation between a man and a woman. I thought there was one phrase in there, the crystal... what was it. The crystal uh shield... that comes down, after, a couple is married."
23_PATT,Oh.
23_EVEL,And I have realized that...
23_PATT,<XX>.
23_EVEL,So many times with friends.
23_LIND,Hm.
23_EVEL,"With whom I was very very intimate. You know. And yet, when they are married."
23_MANY,Hm.
23_EVEL,There is a conjugal.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"Oneness, that is uh, something that I was never able to penetrate."
23_NORA,Stoods.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_LOIS,Hm.
23_EVEL,And I thought that was an interesting phrase.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"I also thought it was very interesting, her relation, with her husband."
23_LIND,Mhm...
23_EVEL,"Why she married him, I don't know, but..."
23_NORA,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,She was able to see the good in any. As well as the bad.
23_LIND,Mhm...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,Hm.
23_EVEL,And to live with it.
23_SUE,And continue to.
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_SUE,"Sort of, push at the bad."
23_KIM,"You know, um."
23_SUE,And try to improve him.
23_LIND,She kept see-.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Maybe it's because she did it with open eyes.
23_LIND,Mhm yeah.
23_KIM,"In the movie, you see her, looking out her window..."
23_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
23_KIM,"Across the street, into the Wilsons' apartment. And they seem to be a happy, very happy congenial family. They seem to have a lot of interaction going on in that family."
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_KIM,I don't know.
23_LIND,It's.
23_KIM,Maybe there was something.
23_LIND,That's true.
23_KIM,"By the fact that she, she saw, uh, a happy family, they talked and communicated, and laughed, and, had a good association with each other. As she peeked out her window, looking at this uh family."
23_LIND,That's a good point.
23_PATT,"Well, and I think."
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_LORI,But.
23_LIND,I think so.
23_PATT,Ruth. Miss-... the first Missis Wilcox thought highly of her husband... and Margaret thought highly of her.
23_MANY,Mhm.
23_EVEL,And do you remember when she was going to go down to Howard's End with her.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_EVEL,And all of a sudden he appeared. He came back.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"And Missis Wilcox said, well I'm so glad to see you, and she walked away with her husband."
23_PATT,Hm.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_LOIS,"Well I think Janice is right. That he was charming, and I'm forget. I think we forget, that we all have that innate need to have a partner. I mean."
23_EVEL,"Well, and, and a provider. Too."
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_EVEL,You know.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_LIND,Yeah.
23_EVEL,He took care of everything.
23_LOIS,"I mean, we all... we all envy that oneness."
23_LIND,Mhm. Mhm.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_DIAN,Mhm.
23_LOIS,"And when you don't have it, you really envy it."
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_LOIS,"So, I mean, that's a r- a strong drawing point. We look over a lot of things, I mean none of us would be married if we were married perfect partners."
23_EVEL,Mhm...
23_SUE,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,Definite-.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_X,Yeah.
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_LOIS,Uh Or if they were looking for perfect.
23_X,Hm.
23_LOIS,In us.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_MANY,Mhm.
23_EVEL,"Well, we are h-... we are all human. I thought that was the b-... the thing about Margaret that I could uh see."
23_PATT,Ten minutes.
23_EVEL,Well... uh that's what I considered spiritual vision.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_PATT,Mhm...
23_DIAN,<NONVERBAL>
23_EVEL,That she could see the human qualities.
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_SUE,"Maybe that's one thing about the book, uh what what Evelyn... what uh Lois said..."
23_X,<NONVERBAL>
23_SUE,"Was that, you know, it translates to everybody. Nobody's husband is perfect."
23_X,Mhm.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_SUE,Y- n- or no... and nobody is perfect...
23_DEBO,<XX>.
23_PATT,Or no person.
23_DEBO,Mhm.
23_PATT,Mhm.
23_DEBO,Mhm.
23_SUE,No person is perfect...
23_NORA,<XX> <XX>.
23_SUE,And therefore.
23_LIND,Mhm.
23_SUE,It's real life.
23_NORA,"Did you take a nap on the floor, or."
23_KIM,Yeah.
23_LOIS,And that's classic.
23_NORA,Jump up and down.
23_SUE,Yeah...
23_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
23_LIND,That's right.
23_ALIC,That's classic.
23_X,That's a classic.
23_SUE,"Every d-, e-."
23_LIND,That's right.
23_SUE,It's every era...
23_LOIS,<NONVERBAL>
23_DIAN,Yeah.
23_EVEL,Mhm.
23_KIM,Before uh...
23_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
23_KIM,Bef- before we break up today...
23_LIND,<XX>.
23_KIM,"Whether it's now or ten minutes from now, could you tell me anything about the book for next month."
23_DEBO,<NONVERBAL>
