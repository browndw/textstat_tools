53_BAIL,Oh okay...
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_BAIL,Are you <XX>. Are you the uh plaintiff.
53_ROSE,Yes. No. I'm the defendant.
53_BAIL,Oh.
53_ROSE,"But I 'm the plaintiff, on the countersuit..."
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_BAIL,Oh.
53_X,Let me have this pen for a minute.
53_X_2,Oh...
53_X_3,<NONVERBAL>
53_X,<XX> that's never worked.
53_X_2,Yeah.
53_ROSE,Sign here.
53_X,Yes.
53_JUDG,"Okay now, this is a case that a v-... originally was filed by Walter Komak, who is now present, uh not present, against Rose Black, um, asking for a security deposit, and since he's not here, uh, we will not rule in favor of him, and then there was a cross complaint, defendant's claim, uh, by uh Rose Black, for five-hundred and thirty-three dollars, balance of rent due, at the end of the lease. And Miss Black, I presume you're the landlord. Is that correct."
53_ROSE,Yes. Mhm.
53_JUDG,"And was there a uh written agreement, or a uh lease."
53_ROSE,Yes.
53_JUDG,"Was it a l-... uh month to month, or a uh."
53_ROSE,A year.
53_JUDG,A one-year lease.
53_ROSE,One year lease.
53_JUDG,"Let me see that please. Okay. So now, uh, how do you arrive at the five thirty-three, you say that they, that Mister Komak owes you."
53_ROSE,"Uh this was the, um, breakdown of the security deposit."
53_JUDG,Let me see that please. So there was original security deposit of eighteen-hundred and seventy-five dollars.
53_ROSE,That's correct.
53_JUDG,"And then you did some repairs on uh, reinstalling screens."
53_ROSE,Right.
53_JUDG,Okay. How come they were... it was necessary to do that.
53_ROSE,Uh They had removed the screens.
53_JUDG,"Okay. Alright. And then um, they owed some rent. They were behind in their rent."
53_ROSE,"Uh, they were not behind in the rent, the. The lease was terminated, because of their behavior. They broke uh s- one of the conditions of the lease, which was not to disturb the other tenants there."
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_ROSE,So I had to give them a three-day notice to leave.
53_JUDG,"T- uh, three-day notice to."
53_ROSE,Quit.
53_JUDG,"Well I know, but, normally you would give em three-day notice to perform uh..."
53_ROSE,"<XX>, Okay."
53_JUDG,"One of the covenants, such as uh..."
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_JUDG,Keep quiet...
53_ROSE,They were not able to be quiet... uh uh Um what ha-.
53_JUDG,"Okay, so then they. So then they left within that three days."
53_ROSE,No. They left a month later. At the end of June. They paid the rent for June.
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_ROSE,"And they left, uh July first. And there were two months left of the lease."
53_JUDG,D-...
53_ROSE,<XX>.
53_JUDG,"And rent's uh, thousand uh, two-hundred."
53_ROSE,Twelve seventy-five.
53_JUDG,Five. Okay.
53_ROSE,Mhm.
53_JUDG,"Now, um, did you rerent the... rerent the premises."
53_ROSE,"Yes I did. As of August twenty-eighth. So it reduced, uh, that seven-hundred three, to five thirty-three."
53_JUDG,"Uh, seven thirty-thr-, I'm not sure wh- where the seven thirty-three comes in."
53_ROSE,Seven o three was the balance that they owed me.
53_JUDG,Seven o three.
53_ROSE,After they moved out.
53_JUDG,"Right. But there's a credit, because they m-... you got."
53_ROSE,That's correct.
53_JUDG,"Okay. So you're giving a three-day's uh credit, and how much is the daily rent."
53_ROSE,"Mm, It was forty-two fifty."
53_JUDG,"Okay. So, how much do you say they now owe you."
53_ROSE,Five-hundred and thirty-three dollar-.
53_JUDG,And I don't... and that's what you put down on your cross complaint.
53_ROSE,That's correct.
53_JUDG,I see.
53_ROSE,Mhm.
53_JUDG,"Okay. Well that seems uh, fundamentally fair, and they're not disputing it, so I will grant you your request. And I will hand back your documents."
53_ROSE,Thank you very much. And how do I get them to pay...
53_BAIL,"Go to the small claims court office, they have some paper work."
53_ROSE,Thank you...
53_X,<XX>.
53_BAIL,There's a small-claims advisor that you can ask.
53_ROSE,Thank you.
53_JUDG,"Okay, the next case will be uh, Mitchell Roberts, versus uh Matthew Collins, ABC Builders Interiors."
53_BAIL,This... both sides are here. Is this contested...
53_MITC,<XX>.
53_BAIL,Who's Mitchell Roberts.
53_MITC,Right here.
53_BAIL,Okay. Sit on this side here... <XX>.
53_X,Sure.
53_BAIL,Who's the party being s- served. You are.
53_X,Thank you.
53_BAIL,Nice pen. Alright.
53_JUDG,"Okay, let's see, who's here now. Mister Roberts."
53_MITC,Right here.
53_JUDG,"And you brought an action, against uh Matthew Collins, for um, roughly seven-hundred dollars, for labor installing a carpet. T- uh, during last uh August to September, okay, and uh, just tell me about how you arrived at uh this claim."
53_MITC,"Uh I was called by Matthew here, to do the job for him. So I went out and looked at the job."
53_JUDG,"Okay, you run a... you run a a carpet business I presume."
53_MITC,Yes. I'm a licensed contractor.
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_MITC,"Um, the job was out at UCSB, I went and estimated the job for myself, to see if I could take the job, for what he wanted to pay for it, and I let him know that I could not. Do the job. I wouldn't make any money. So uh, upon me telling him that, he offered, to pay my employees, fill out, he had em fill out double-u two forms all of em, and he paid him, to lessen the burden of payment on me, so that I in turn would make more money off the job. I agreed to that, after about."
53_JUDG,Ca- uh is that a normal procedure <XX>.
53_MITC,"Not at all. He wanted me to do the job, so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back, so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on."
53_JUDG,"So in other words, your... your helpers would really be his employees for the purpose of this job."
53_MITC,That's correct. He had em all fill out the plo- proper forms.
53_JUDG,So then your costs would be reduced there as far as.
53_MITC,That's correct.
53_JUDG,Alright.
53_MITC,"Uh, I went to receive my check, of which, we had agreed, that he would deduct, the amount of the hourly wage, that he was."
53_JUDG,"Was this agreement in writing, or verbal."
53_MITC,"Completely verbal. I've been working with him for like six years. Uh, upon a reve- uh... uh receiving my check, uh, for about two and a half weeks of work, approximately between fifty and seventy hours, I was paid three-hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents. So I approached him with it, and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here, and noted that, what the employees made, and uh, at twenty-six percent less deduction on these two employees. Which was the employer contribution. So I noted to him that he was supposed to pay that, he said, uh n-, no, you're gonna pay it. So I said that's not as per our agreement, he said yes it is, he handed me my check, rolled up his window, and drove off. And he's there to state, he's... he saw that, and was witness to that. I have a letter."
53_JUDG,I don- I don't think it's relevant that he rolled up his window and drove off <XX>.
53_MITC,"Well, I know. But, that-... that was the end of our thing, I tried to contact him everything, finally I uh contacted my attorney, I'd like to present this letter to you here."
53_JUDG,"Okay. If I may look at that. And, have you shown that to uh Mister Collins."
53_MITC,Yes please. Yes. He has... he has received a copy of that letter...
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_JUDG,Now Stu Roberts is an attorney. Is that correct.
53_MITC,Yes sir.
53_JUDG,You're uh.
53_MITC,I'm his nephew.
53_JUDG,You're his nephew. And you're Nick Ro- Roberts' nephew too then.
53_MITC,That's correct.
53_JUDG,"Okay. So uh your uncle then wrote uh Builders uh a letter, that's what I'm reading now."
53_MITC,Yes sir.
53_JUDG,"Uh I do emphasize that I'm reading it, this is not evidence, this is only y- your story, that you've told Mister Roberts."
53_MITC,"That's correct, That's correct."
53_JUDG,Okay. So really the dispute then boils down to this twenty-six percent.
53_MITC,That's it sir.
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_MITC,"That's the reason why I had him fill out that portion of, or he wanted to write those checks. Was so I would save that money, so I would do that job."
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_MITC,At the end of the job.
53_JUDG,"Mister Collins I know you're, biting at the bit there, you wanna say something, so why don't you go ahead."
53_MATT,"Okay thank you your honor. Um, uh pretty much, um, what Mitchell has stated is untrue. Mitchell, uh did do some work for me out at the college, we did the Anacapa Residential Hall. And this is a, eight-thousand-yard job, that we did this summer. It required us to, employ, oh five or six crews, uh Mitchell Roberts was one of them that we used, on the job, Uh Mitchell expressed a desire to do the work out there, he expressed, he did not know how to handle the payroll. Most of the uh contractors here in town, that are independents like Mitchell, don't know how to do prevailing wage statements..."
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_MATT,"The college is a state-funded uh uh remodel, and on state-funded remodels, we're required, to pay prevailing wages. Uh prevailing wages, that, um, that indicate different levels of agility, of the different men working. And so, uh a lot of the crews, uh, like Mitchell, who have people that work under him, around town, in regular situations, come to the people like me, and ask us to do payroll for them. When we do the payroll for them, we state to them up front, that uh, we will pay the payroll, we will make the deductions, and then the employer contribution, which is approximately twenty-six percent, over and above the hourly wage, is also deducted, from the um subcontractor's check."
53_JUDG,"Now this uh th- twenty-six percent, that'd be be social security, and what else would it include."
53_MATT,Um.
53_JUDG,Sorta like um.
53_MITC,That's anything above that.
53_MATT,Well you have. You have...
53_X,<XX>.
53_MATT,"You have that. I have a breakdown here, of what we paid Mitchell's men..."
53_JUDG,<XX>.
53_MATT,If you'd like to see that.
53_JUDG,"Okay. I mean, do... yeah, y- you got a total of uh, seven point six five percent employer contributions on the."
53_MATT,"Um, that explains it pretty well, there's quite a few deductions, of course-... <XX>."
53_JUDG,"Oh and and the oh the... the f-... the annual unemployment insurance, and uh."
53_MATT,Right.
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_MATT,Worker's compensation.
53_JUDG,Right.
53_MATT,"FUDA FICA, et cetera. Now that's, um, in any payroll deduction situation, you have, the employee contribution, which is deducted from the employee's wages, gross wages, and then you have the employer's contribution, which is over and above that..."
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_MATT,"Which the employer has to pay. Now the agreement that we had made, with all of the um, subcontractors, uh, Mark Preston's sitting here, which is testifying for Mitch Roberts, also did work for me, and he was treated the same way. We paid him, we took his deductions out, as well as that, and, so we, uh did that, with everybody."
53_JUDG,Okay wai- uh. I wanna make sure now... uh That would be fine if that was the agreement. Now you say that the w-... you under-... you explained that to Mister Roberts.
53_MATT,Uh yes sir. Before he went to work.
53_JUDG,"Okay. Mister Roberts, did you have any conversations."
53_MITC,Absolutely not.
53_JUDG,With Matthew Collins about that.
53_MITC,"The reason, and I stress this. And I don't like to waste the court's time. But, my total, I agree. If whatever he just said right there was true, with withholding and everything."
53_JUDG,Right I'm.
53_MITC,That was fine.
53_JUDG,It really boils down.
53_MITC,But.
53_JUDG,What- what was the discussion the agreement regarding this.
53_MITC,The discussion...
53_JUDG,<XX>.
53_MITC,"The agreement would be, that he would pay everything. So that I wouldn't."
53_JUDG,Did he say everything.
53_MITC,"Y- everything. So that I wouldn't end up making, after fifty hou- fifty hours work, which I knew I was gonna make, when I had to play my em- part of an employer contribution, I have my own payroll service. They do all that for me, and they're very familiar with all types of pay. This is why I didn't wanna take the job to begin with."
53_JUDG,Uh I can u-.
53_MITC,He in turn.
53_JUDG,I can appreciate that... now.
53_MITC,Okay.
53_JUDG,"Mister Collins says, he denies that you said, everything. Right. He just."
53_MITC,I wouldn't've. I wouldn't've done it.
53_MATT,Well.
53_JUDG,"You have a different story, on what the agreement was."
53_MATT,"Right. Um, uh Karen here, uh, does all the payroll, and uh, she's here to testify about a conversation, that her and Mitchell had, in our office, about this very thing, and I'd like to."
53_JUDG,Before or after the agreement was entered into.
53_MATT,"After the agreement was entered into, he had been on the job for about a week or so, and, it was time, I believe for the-, first or second pay period for his men, Uh he came into the office, and had a conversation with Karen, about, A the payroll, and B this twenty-six percent that we're talking about. And she'd be happy to tell you."
53_JUDG,"Okay ma'am, why don't you please, explain the conversation you had with Mister Roberts."
53_KARE,"Okay. Um, he was... we were going over the wages for Phil Nigel, who was one of the gentlemen on there, as to how much Phil was to get, for the job. On an hourly basis. And, he had mentioned to me, that he was wanting him to get ex amount, and I said okay, if it's ex amount to Phil, then, plus twenty-six percent means, I take out this amount, from your check. And he goes oh. Well then no, I don't wanna have the, you know, take out that much. So we were going back and forth with the figures, and so finally, this is the, uh, wage that we came up with, which was thirteen fifty to Phil..."
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_KARE,"And then have seventeen dollars an hour, taken out of Mitch 's check. Mitch Roberts' check. And this is the note that I'd written down on that. And then, you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty-six percent, which is three fifty-one, would actually equal to seventeen o one, and I said."
53_MATT,Why don't you show him the note.
53_KARE,"You know, just the seventeen was fine."
53_JUDG,"Oh this. So, d- did you have that conversation."
53_MITC,"I don't. I had that perfect conversation with her. And that's very true, exactly what you said. But she never told me anything about, this twenty-six percent, that was coming a- come out of my check. Why-. It's."
53_X,Go ahead.
53_MARK,"I was offered, Matthew offered me, I'm Mark Preston, I'm a licensed contractor also, and Matthew offered me the same situation. And it was my understanding, that he was to pay everything. Supply the glue, supply... and take care of my guys, and make the payroll, and pay all of the employer's stuff. If you're an employer, you gotta pay the stuff. You gotta pay all the extra things."
53_JUDG,"But, you don't have any... y- you can't testify..."
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
53_JUDG,"Unless I'm wrong, about the conversation those two had. You weren't there. Is that correct."
53_MARK,"I know for a fact that, Mitch was mak-."
53_MATT,He was not there.
53_MARK,"M- and-... he just mentioned that he. Matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check. He did not. I worked strictly by the yard, and I paid my people. Prevailing wages."
53_JUDG,Well any agreement he had with you is not relevant to the agreement he had with Mister Roberts.
53_MARK,"Well, uhuh I saw the people's checks, and, I'm just drawing a pi-, verify what Mitch said. H- Ma- Mister Collins was supposed to pay everything."
53_MITC,He approached him with the same.
53_MARK,"Fir- f- f-... with the exact same thing, And he d-. Jerry Stillman he did the same thing, he did the same thing with Marco Villaremo. Who're all licensed contractors."
53_JUDG,But I still. I still don't know...
53_MARK,<NONVERBAL>
53_JUDG,"That may have been on other cases, the question is, did he do it in this case."
53_MITC,"He... it would be, if it may please you, uh, the whole reason why I'm here. Is because he took that twenty-six percent out, that he told me he wasn't gonna take, he used it as, more or less bait me to do the job, and went ahead and withheld it from me. Without saying a word to it, I had nothing, I was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job."
53_JUDG,I understand that.
53_MITC,"And, when he wrote my check. He wrote my check to me, handed it to me through a window, says that's the way it is, and th-... and and you know... it wasn't... and- he uh totally evaded me, he has to this day evaded me."
53_JUDG,"Mister Roberts. That's beside the point. What I'm trying to uh. We have to really hone in on-, what was the agreement. Not how he paid you."
53_MITC,The agreement was.
53_JUDG,If he.
53_MITC,That.
53_JUDG,"You know, I don't care if he folded an airplane and ma-... and sailed it through the air."
53_MITC,He would pay all my employees. That was the agreement. Everything.
53_JUDG,But he di-... he disputes that.
53_MITC,"Well, I understand that. That's why we're here your honor."
53_JUDG,"Okay. But, you're the plaintiff. You have the burden of proving your case. That's the problem I have is, you've gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence, that what you're saying is true."
53_MITC,Well then if.
53_JUDG,"More-... more likely than not. Now you say one thing, and he says another."
53_MITC,"Then... when- when a person fills out, or has other employees fill out the double-u two forms and everything, why would I become liable, for that contribution. When h- when he in fact by law, is now employing those employees. He's the employer. I am doing nothing. Isn't there a law that states that fact. When you have, uh people, work for you, and fill out specific forms to the state, stating that."
53_JUDG,Tell me again. Wh-... what were the... what was the agreement again. Go- go through the... y- conversation as you saw it.
53_MITC,"Conversation was, Mitch, if you do this job, I'll go ahead and pay all your employees, and you in turn will be able to pa- make more money."
53_JUDG,That was pretty much it.
53_MITC,That's it. That's to the point.
53_JUDG,Oh so he in effect said.
53_MITC,And that's it.
53_JUDG,I will pay your employees.
53_MITC,"That's correct. And he did sir. And then when it came to the employer contribution, without my knowledge or anything, until I received this check, he just yanked that right out of my check."
53_JUDG,"And Mister Collins uh, that conv-... tell me about the conversation you believe happened."
53_MATT,"Well, um, Mitch and I, um, Mitch had come to me and said he would do the work out there, but he wanted to do the work under the basis that I paid his men, and I told him about, what I said earlier here."
53_JUDG,About the twenty-six percent.
53_MATT,Yes.
53_JUDG,That was mentioned to him.
53_KARE,Always.
53_MATT,"Oh yes. Uh, always, it was mentioned with Karen here, on her note of nine two ninety-three, that she wrote down her note that she talked with him."
53_RADI,Twelve fourteen.
53_MATT,"And at uh, at every juncture. He was... uh made aware of, the uh, the contributions, were made by the employer. These were his men, and we were doing a service for him, under this agreement that we had between us."
53_JUDG,"Now just... uh just seems from a logical standpoint, I wasn't there obviously, it seems like if you had said that to him, he would've said wait a minute, it's not worth it to me."
53_MITC,That's correct.
53_JUDG,Would you. Would you think he would say that.
53_MATT,"Yes, I would think he would. Why would he do the work."
53_JUDG,Okay.
53_MITC,So you would trick me into doing it. Tho-.
53_JUDG,"Well not if he, not if he said to you."
53_MITC,"No, but then..."
53_MATT,<NONVERBAL>
53_MITC,"Then, with all my... with my fourteen years experience. Why would I do that amount amount of work, and knowingly for over fifty hours of work."
53_JUDG,Well I <XX>.
53_MITC,Know I was gonna take him three hundred and sixteen dollars to do it.
53_JUDG,"That may be a like a buyer's remorse, so I... uh I don't."
53_MITC,Well that's not. I have fourteen years experience in the trade. That's why I turned the d- the job down to begin with. Without doing any work at all.
53_JUDG,"Well, I'll tell you... uh if Mister Roberts' testimony is correct he should win, and Mister Collins' testimony is correct then he should prevail."
53_MITC,And I agree with you.
53_JUDG,Now-.
53_MITC,"But the fact remains, that I would not have done the work, for this amount of money. That's why I turned the job down to begin with. That's why I'm here in the court today, to make the court decide. It shouldn't. It shouldn't be legal for guys to do this."
53_JUDG,"Well I'm gonna make... uh. I'm gonna make, uh, in my mind, a bad decision today. Now, you both seem very truthful and honest. I wasn't there."
53_MITC,"But, I'm the one that's bearing the burden of this monetary amount."
53_JUDG,"You have to bear the burden uh proving it, but."
53_MITC,I understand that.
53_JUDG,"Uh I'm gonna award, um, Mister Roberts, three-hundred fifty dollars. Approximately half. Now Mister Collins may not like that... now y-... if he doesn't like it, then he can go ahead appeal it across the street superior court. Running the risk that he might face, the full amount of seven-hundred and four dollars."
53_MATT,I will appeal.
53_JUDG,"Okay. But I'm going to get it... and uh award mister Roberts, uh three-hundred and fifty dollars, and if neither party is happy, maybe there's an old saying in court that, both parties are unhappy, the judge made a good decision. So."
53_MATT,Thank you your honor.
53_JUDG,"Make it for the uh, plaintiff of three-fifty."
53_X,There's some.
53_JUDG,And I will allow the court costs of twenty dollars and thirty cents.
53_X,I think there's some papers up there.
53_MITC,Thank you your honor...
53_X,<NONVERBAL>
