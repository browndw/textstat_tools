50_DANA,It's empty.
50_ARIA,Yeah...
50_KELL,<XX>.
50_ARIA,It's totally empty.
50_KELL,"It's totally empty, there's like pans on that shelf there, but that's okay, the whole bottom's empty yeah. I don't know, what... whatever. Mm."
50_ARIA,"Cause last year, we said, oh, well we'll all share food."
50_DANA,Unhunh.
50_KELL,Mm.
50_ARIA,"And then, like, with Moll, who you do not wanna be sharing food with."
50_DANA,Unhunh.
50_ARIA,Then we each had our own cupboard...
50_X,<XX>.
50_ARIA,And that worked out pretty well.
50_NANC,Yeah.

50_ARIA,Right.
50_KELL,I mean that's different.
50_DANA,But like little things like.
50_ARIA,Or like drinks. Like when we even mixed iced tea or something.
50_DANA,Yeah. Yeah.
50_ARIA,They just drank it. We can do that.
50_DANA,"Like there's, gra- I bought cranberry juice so."
50_ARIA,Mm.
50_DANA,Free for all man.
50_NANC,Mhm.
