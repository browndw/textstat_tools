51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,The. Up in the penthouse. There are some larger apartments...
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"Because people have bought neighboring apartments, and expanded and mixed them. You know, but, they're mostly, well there're some studios, and some one-bedrooms, and two-bedrooms."
51_SEAN,And has it always been an apartment house.
51_FRAN,Yeah...
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,What-. What is the real e- estate market doing. Is it down now.
51_FRAN,"Well, it's down in general."
51_ALIC,In New York.
51_FRAN,"But certain areas, yeah. Certain areas sort of held their value..."
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"And what happened would be, rather than have it, things kinda crashing. S- a-. W-... uh It would just... uh Things would be slow to sell. But, they would ho-. The Village is one of the few areas that held its value. Um, but, certain things are a drug on the market..."
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"If you have a studio apartment, you're stuck with it..."
51_SEAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,For the rest of your life. Like herpes.
51_FRAN,"Certainly for the next ten years. And, and..."
51_SEAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"If you have a one-bedroom, it has to have something kinda going for it. Or you're gonna be sorta stuck. You could be stuck with it. Um, two-bedrooms and up are, are f-... easy to se-, easier to sell."
51_ALIC,"Cause Beth. You know, my friend."

51_FRAN,Now see the Upper East Side took one of the.
51_SEAN,East Side isn't it.
51_BERN,Real nice Sutton Place.
51_SEAN,It's nice.
51_FRAN,One of the hardest hits for dropped values.
51_BERN,Because it had soared so high.
51_FRAN,Th- They. Two things. They had soared really high.
51_BERN,That ch-.
51_FRAN,"And, there was an awful lot. Because they soared so high, that area had less zoning, uh."
51_ALIC,Restrictions.
51_FRAN,"Restrictions. And they w-. There was uh. There was a lotta building in the area. And so, between those two things, that market was."
51_BERN,Lotta new buildings.
51_FRAN,"Yeah. And the new buildings are, I don't like the new buildings."
51_ALIC,Do you like living in New York.
51_FRAN,"Yeah. I love it. We traveled all over. We looked around. We thought, my husband and I stayed out on the road, for two years. And we went all over the United States, and we d-, we didn't find any place we liked better."
51_ALIC,So you went from New Orleans to New York.
51_FRAN,Yeah. Oh that I did years ago. That I did.
51_ALIC,But it's the new. That part <XX>.
51_FRAN,"God knows, s- nineteen si- sixty something. Sixty-three. Thirty years ago."

51_ALIC,Thirty years in New York...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,Yeah.
51_ALIC,Wow.
51_FRAN,"I did take five years off. I went to uh, Florida, which was a terrible mistake. We needed a vacation, and we accidentally moved instead."
51_ALIC,Oh.
51_FRAN,"And then, we realized that, Well, The first year we were there, we visited New York six times, and we looked at each other and said..."
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"God, we certainly do go back up there a lot, what do you think that's about. You know, and we were just getting increasingly bored down there and, you know, you- get occupied fixing up a house, and that's kinda fun, and then."
51_ALIC,Where in Florida were you.
51_FRAN,"On the Gulf Coast, Fort Myers Beach. We had a nice house, right on the sea."
51_SEAN,In. Yeah.
51_FRAN,Right on the sea.
51_SEAN,I saw pictures.
51_FRAN,"It was beautiful. But the poor house, was in fucking Fort Myers Beach..."
51_ALIC,<XX> curbs...
51_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,They have ramps on all the curbs for the wheelchairs.
51_FRAN,Yes...
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"Right, We had to, W- i- the building code, you have to have a ramp..."
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,But anyway uh.
51_ALIC,"You know, handicap bars on your bathroom-. In your bathroom."
51_FRAN,"That's right, But uh..."
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"But, we didn't like it. At all. And so, that's when we said, well let's not do anything precipitous, like we did moving down here, before we race back to New York, let's look around a little bit. So we hit the road. And we stayed out for a couple years."
51_SEAN,Two years they'd been looking.
51_FRAN,Looking all over.
51_SEAN,For other places.
51_ALIC,"Looking round, Really. And."
51_FRAN,Unhunh. Round the US.
51_ALIC,Wow.
51_FRAN,"And we, kept finding these nice places..."
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"And we'd say, isn't this place nice. And, Larry would say, yes, it's lovely. Look at these beautiful homes. Isn't that nice. Yes. Isn't that nice. Isn't that nice. Yeah, but it's not New York."
51_BERN,It's...
51_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,You w-. Wow.
51_FRAN,And so we'd drive on. We found lots of places that we like to spend.
51_BERN,"Oh, if New York's under your skin, watch out."
51_FRAN,"Uh Yeah, it's like a drug."
51_BERN,You can't get out. It. It is.
51_FRAN,You're finished.
51_BERN,It is a drug.
51_FRAN,"That's it. You're consigned, the rest of your life."
51_ALIC,Do they have New York AA.
51_FRAN,To ludicrous rents.
51_ALIC,"You know, or maybe they've been to New York."
51_BERN,Well...
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>

51_ALIC,I'm a New York-a holic.
51_FRAN,Weren't we saying.
51_BERN,"No she's s-. She's asking if they have, they should have an addiction to New York."
51_SEAN,Or.

51_ALIC,Didn't matter <XX>.
51_BERN,But they do have a.
51_SEAN,But in fact.
51_BERN,They do have an AA.
51_SEAN,AA is dif-... completely different in New York City.
51_BERN,"Which is, different."
51_SEAN,Than it is anywhere else in the world.
51_BERN,That's right.
51_FRAN,Well the Village is.
51_BERN,Don't you think.
51_SEAN,Much more exciting.
51_FRAN,"Yes, it's true."
51_SEAN,Better speak-.
51_ALIC,Really.
51_FRAN,"Well, the thing that."
51_SEAN,Oh the best speakers in the world.
51_BERN,"You know, you know what the saying in AA is."
51_SEAN,Because you have all those famous people.
51_BERN,"If you can, or in New York, we- we've always heard that the saying is, if you can stay..."
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_BERN,"New Yorkers say, if you can stay sober in AA, you can stay sober anywhere..."
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,It's true...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,And we even say that about certain meetings...
51_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,If you can stay sober at.
51_SEAN,Plus really smart people-.
51_BERN,Jessa. Calm down.
51_SEAN,You know.
51_BERN,Quit that crying.
51_FRAN,"Well New Yorkers are extremely candid. And, also, very, emotionally accessible. Which is not the reputation we have outside. Of New York. But, you know. I mean, if you ask a cab driver, if he speaks English. Okay, let's assume you got one who speaks English. And he's sorta been a little bit acculturated... you know. But if you g-. Not- not the Pakistanis fresh off the, off the boat."
51_ALIC,Yeah.
51_FRAN,"Or any of that. You know, but you get your basic New York cab driver."
51_SEAN,They talk.
51_FRAN,"And you, You say, you know, how's it going. He'll tell you."
51_SEAN,Yep he-. Unhunh.
51_FRAN,"You know. I mean, I had one guy, he talked to me the whole time I was dr-, about this new diet he was on, and, he ate apples, and his wife was really happy, and, and their sex life had improved, and, and this is a guy like seventy years old, or something, he'd been driving a cab for forty years, and proud of it, and, his kids went through this school and that s-, I mean, very open. And, the. But the r-. The new. The b- New Yorker is usually in a hurry. And so they'll tell you anything, they'll give you anything. But just hurry up and tell em exactly what you want."
51_ALIC,I I can never get a cab in New York. Cause everybody takes it away from me...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,"I mean when I am, I'm just there for hours, fo- i- wi-."
51_BERN,Y- you gotta jump.
51_ALIC,I. I can't do it.
51_BERN,Yeah.
51_ALIC,I go.
51_BERN,It's a.
51_ALIC,"Okay, I'm outa here. If you don't wanna take me, I won't go..."
51_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,I just can't get a cab.
51_SEAN,Well how do you get around.
51_ALIC,I just wait for that hour. Until.
51_SEAN,Oh...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,"You know, it's like two AM. Okay, no one is here, no competition. I'm gonna get this cab..."
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,My kids said.
51_BERN,Oh.
51_ALIC,"Come on, you're. I said, I'm doing the best I can..."
51_SEAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,"You know, I really am, this is me being assertive."
51_BERN,Jump out...
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_BERN,And open the door fast.
51_FRAN,Well there's also a lighting system...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,That if you don't understand it.
51_ALIC,Ah.
51_FRAN,"It's confusing. Because, there's a light on the top, that tells you if they're on duty or off duty, and if they have a fare or not. And you can wave forever, and if they have fares, they- c- they won't stop."
51_ALIC,"No, they would always stop and, I would get em, it's just the person behind me, pushing me out of the way. Getting into the cab."
51_FRAN,"Where were you, in front of Saks or something..."
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,Grand Central Station probably.
51_FRAN,Oh Grand Central...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"Oh, I'm guilty. Grand Central. I had a client in the office building next to Grand Central..."
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,And I used to get in there and muscle people in front of me.
51_ALIC,It's impossible.
51_FRAN,Yeah really...
51_ALIC,I've always.
51_FRAN,"Cause it's an, a constant flow."
51_ALIC,It's horrible.
51_BERN,"New Yorker's are. Yeah. It's. You're in a hurry, you're in a rush, and you learn to be a little assertive."
51_FRAN,Yeah.
51_BERN,Or is it aggressive.
51_SEAN,Um.
51_FRAN,Well it's.
51_SEAN,Who would like what to drink with dinner...
51_ALIC,It's ballistic.
51_SEAN,Here's the choices.
51_ALIC,I have.
51_SEAN,"Mineral water, root beer, diet soda, or um, kinda strawberry so- soda."
51_ALIC,How about regular water.
51_FRAN,"I think re- um, mineral water is what I want."
51_SEAN,Okay.
51_ALIC,"Regular water, do you have that."
51_SEAN,Yep. Oh we have lots of that.

51_SEAN,"Oh, that one goes with. That's um, um, God <XX>, Isis and Osiris. Osiris."

51_FRAN,"For one thing, I had uh."
51_SEAN,You bring the plates.
51_FRAN,"Such a tiny apartment. Um, when we went back to New York, um, I had kept a studio there. And of course, that was small and, and then, we found another studio, in uh, in our neighborhood, that we liked, in the Village, and we moved into that, and we just got so busy, we didn't get around to moving into a real apartment."
51_SEAN,Mm.
51_FRAN,Until this past year. So that's why I'm doing it now.
51_SEAN,This is alright.
51_FRAN,"But I also know, that I wasn't really ready to do it until now. So. You know, but it's okay now."
51_ALIC,"Yeah, you know I take care of people's estates, and my... my garage is filled with dead people's things."
51_FRAN,Yeah.
51_ALIC,"That, I don't. I wanna toss em. But it just. Maybe worth something, maybe somebody'll surface, so I have like four years' worth now... of, well-... you know, an antique mirror, just. And every once in a while somebody'll show up and say, do you know where such and such is. And I'll say, I've got that... and I'll hand it to em... and they're, I mean that just happened to me."
51_FRAN,Yeah.
51_ALIC,A few weeks ago.
51_FRAN,They're excited and happy.
51_ALIC,Mhm.
51_FRAN,Yeah... that's great.
51_ALIC,"And, But it's stuff."

51_FRAN,"Oh, heaven."
51_ALIC,It should be going up.
51_BERN,Where's the microphone.
51_ALIC,This red one. Here. I'm not mechanical Sean.
51_SEAN,It's a Sean concoction.
51_ALIC,It's. Looks like it's going too fast to be recording.
51_FRAN,What is it.
51_BERN,"No, that looks right."
51_FRAN,Oh trust the machinery.
51_ALIC,It-. I don't.
51_SEAN,If it didn't it didn't.
51_FRAN,Oh this is great.
51_SEAN,Hey.

51_ALIC,Where do I sit. Here.
51_SEAN,Here.

51_SEAN,I looked at the navy.
51_FRAN,And.
51_ALIC,Oh wow.
51_FRAN,"Uh, because, I had another fabric, it's uh, it's a gorgeous blue with gold beads."
51_BERN,Do you need to scoot.
51_ALIC,Wow this is great.
51_FRAN,And I wanted to mix the two fabrics. And the red didn't work with it.
51_BERN,Yeah.

51_SEAN,It. The chair's died.
51_BERN,It was horrible. Yeah.
51_FRAN,Yeah.
51_SEAN,"And so I went to the design center, and I went to all the places, and, that was the one."
51_FRAN,Yeah.
51_ALIC,Why do we have to look at the one I'm uh on...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,"Because you're the s-... you're- you're the slimmest, and show the most cu- uh."
51_ALIC,"Oh, chair."
51_FRAN,Cushion cleft.

51_SEAN,"We took care of Jerrod, and that's when we really. Well, we had heard of Fran."
51_FRAN,That's when I really got to meet em.
51_SEAN,"For a long time from Jerrod, and, but that's how we really met."
51_ALIC,Brother and sister.
51_BERN,I thought he just made it up.
51_SEAN,And then she's come.
51_FRAN,His faux sister.
51_SEAN,Almost every year.
51_BERN,Yes.
51_FRAN,His fantasy sister.
51_BERN,Right.
51_FRAN,Well I used to come out here.
51_ALIC,To see your brother.
51_FRAN,"With great regularity. I mean, I was out here about every year-."
51_ALIC,"Don't you love it out here, don't you love it."
51_FRAN,"I do, I adore it."
51_ALIC,This is-. Wouldn't this be in the top three of.
51_FRAN,"This would be, if. Were I going to leave New York. This would definitely be, I think this would be my second choice. And, the other thing I would maybe do is, go back to New Orleans. But then like, I don't know."
51_SEAN,New Orleans.
51_FRAN,"Maybe come here in the summer or something. Because, it's just beastly there in the summer. You know, but this is definitely, and, oddly enough, do you know where else I might go. Buffalo New York. Is a wonderful city."
51_BERN,I've heard.
51_FRAN,It has.
51_ALIC,Buffalo.

51_ALIC,Sean this is great.
51_FRAN,Well it's a good day for people to be indoors listening to the radio.
51_BERN,Buffalo uh.
51_SEAN,Is that where Linda's from.
51_FRAN,Linda's from Corning.
51_BERN,Or is she up farther. Up farther.
51_FRAN,Which is uh not too far away. But it's in the s-...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,In the same general area.
51_SEAN,Mm... came out good.
51_ALIC,It's great.
51_FRAN,Mm. Is this. We. This looks like something we used to call grillades. In New- in New Orleans. What is it.
51_SEAN,Grillades. Hunh.
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_SEAN,"This is red beans and rice, with some steak."
51_FRAN,Unhunh.
51_SEAN,"And um, green and and red peppers cut up."
51_FRAN,It's delicious.
51_BERN,It is delicious Sean.
51_ALIC,Mm. It's great...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,Did you invent this. Cause it's very like a New Orleans recipe.
51_SEAN,Mhm. I invented it.
51_ALIC,Mhm.
51_FRAN,Mm. Wonderful.
51_SEAN,"I had red beans and rice, for dinner, last week, and it was so great, and I thought, I could make this for a dinner party."
51_ALIC,"Yeah, what can I. You know."
51_SEAN,"And just. And I'll just add to it, and, that's what I like. Is to add."
51_FRAN,And jazz it up.
51_SEAN,I couldn't really follow a recipe.
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_SEAN,"I mean I could but, Hm."
51_BERN,"I used to say, well how much did you put in. I don't know."
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_SEAN,I don't know.
51_ALIC,"Can you do it again. No, I don't think so."
51_SEAN,No.
51_FRAN,"Well, my cooking comes out different, differently every time. Every time I make something."
51_ALIC,Every so-.
51_FRAN,"The only thing that's consistent is, my fried chicken, pretty much tastes the same, and, spaghetti sauce I make, tastes pretty much the same."
51_SEAN,Do you cook a lot.
51_FRAN,"I used to, I haven't in several years."
51_SEAN,Hm.
51_FRAN,"But now, I have a kitchen that, again I'll cook. I at least I."
51_SEAN,You're on the twelfth floor.
51_FRAN,"Yeah, I have great views. I'm thrilled with the views."
51_ALIC,You can ki- cook on the twelfth floor.
51_FRAN,Mhm...
51_SEAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,<XX>.
51_SEAN,Are you sure.
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_ALIC,"I think there's something, the pressure though. The air is thin."
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_ALIC,As you go up.
51_FRAN,You have to adjust for altitude.
51_BERN,I was thinking of the barbecue...
51_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,That's right. Everything cooks faster.
51_BERN,I always run outside and cook.
51_FRAN,Mm.
51_BERN,"The altitude. You have to be careful. Right, Especially with you're baking."
51_FRAN,Right...
51_BERN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,<NONVERBAL>
51_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_SEAN,"Well Fran, I've been looking, really, for a year or two, at different places to live. I went back to Europe."
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_SEAN,"To London and Paris, I've been in Sun Valley, Tucson, I've been... and Montana, Seattle, I liked Seattle a lot."
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_SEAN,"But I couldn't live there. And. Outside of New York, and I couldn't go back to live in New York again, it's been, I'm over it."
51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_SEAN,This is the best place I've found.

51_SEAN,"Might as well not look Sean, I've looked everywhere."
51_ALIC,I've looked everywhere...
51_SEAN,<NONVERBAL>
51_ALIC,You know.
51_FRAN,It's pointless.
51_ALIC,I've looked everywhere.
51_FRAN,Right.
51_SEAN,This is a tiny little geographically wonderful.
51_ALIC,Haven. This is.
51_SEAN,Mhm.
51_FRAN,Bloom.
51_SEAN,And it is the geography Alice.
51_ALIC,It's whatever it is. It works.
51_SEAN,"It's geography. But I do miss, a lot of things about a city. And about New York."
51_FRAN,"Well we go to the opera, and I go to museums."
51_SEAN,Mm.
51_FRAN,"And, I would miss that."
51_SEAN,Mhm.
51_BERN,The New York opera.
51_FRAN,The Met.
51_BERN,Mhm.
51_ALIC,That's the best part of Age of Innocence. The beginning of it. I just saw that today.

51_FRAN,"But the, uh I don't know when it-. You know, they tore it down, and I don't remember. I was too new."
51_ALIC,"You'll be able to see in the movie, if you recognize."
51_FRAN,"I was too new in New York, to understand what it meant. You know."
51_SEAN,Mm.
51_FRAN,So.
51_ALIC,"Well I grew up in Philadelphia, and that's too close to New York..."
51_SEAN,<NONVERBAL>

51_FRAN,Mhm.
51_ALIC,On the train. Every Wednesday. On theater day.
51_SEAN,Oh you went a lot.
