In Spring Grove Illinois, there is a festival, children under twelve are free, I'll just mention that to all you parents, Um, and it's called the Illinois storytelling festival, Have any of you ever gone. I know you have. Alright..."
54_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"Put your hand down. Uh uh. When I found out I was telling here, I didn't realize, that Dusty, uh had attended your church a number of times, he's also a storyteller, uh, from the Illinois storytelling festival. And uh, we would love to have you all come. There are four tents, a children's tent, an adult tent, a general tent, and then a traditions tent. Where everyone can come and just, share their memories of growing up, or, world war whatever, or, f- first time you ever rode in a train, all of those things, it's a wonderful family event. And I hope that some of you would be able to come..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"The next story that I have, is from, the Native Americans. It's called how the stars got in the sky. Did you ever wonder how the stars got in the sky. This is the way the Indians think that the stars got in the sky. And I learned this story, from, a white man, who had been adopted into a tribe in Michigan. In Wisconsin, he has taken on all of the Native American ways. And the people thought so much of him, that they have given him, uh, also a Native American name. And he gave me permission to tell the story. Long ago, in the sky there was only the sun and the moon. And on the nights, when the moon didn't shine, it was very dark. Indeed. Well all of the animals got together, and decided they were going to go to the creator. To see if he could help with the problem. Well, when they arrived, the creator said, I will help you, but first you must do something. All of you are to go down to the lake. And gather stones. Now not round stones, like the moon, but jagged stones. And when you have got as many as you can carry, bring them to me, and then I will help you. And so, all the animals went to the lake. All except coyote. Because coyote was lazy..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And he was asleep. So, all the animals gathered as many stones as they could carry, the large animals had a great many stones. And the little animals like grasshopper and bumblebee, they could only carry one..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"But they all brought them to the feet of the creator. All except coyote. Because, he was lazy and..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"He was asleep. So the creator looked over all the stones that were brought, and chose one. Not too large..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And reached up, and placed it in the sky. And when he did, it began to twinkle. And he said, this I will call a star. And this one a special star. A homing star. The North Star. And this evening, all of you animals, are going to go, off the edge of the Earth, into the sky, to make your pictures. With stars. And so, that evening, all of the animals, gathered their stones, and they walked off the edge of the world. Into the sky. To make their pictures. With the brilliant dots, that would turn into stars. They all went except coyote. Because he was lazy. And he was asleep. Well after all the animals had gone, the creator called to coyote..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"He said, Coyote, come on now, get up. Time-. Enough of this being lazy, come on over here, I have a job for you. And coyote, he yawned and, he got up, and he dragged himself to the presence of the creator, and said ye- yes, what, what do you need me to do. And the creator said, well all of the animals have gone off the edge of the Earth, to make pictures in the sky. But some of them can't carry very many stones. I want you to take this..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"This great big bag of stones into the sky, and when any of the other animals need them, then you give them the extras that they need..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"Well, coyote was lazy. And he took one look at that bag and thought, hoh, I don't wanna do that. But you don't argue with the creator..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And so, he said he would. And he, got up and he, took that heavy bag and, put it on his back and, he walked off the edge of the Earth..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,Into the sky. Well he hadn't gone very far...
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,When that bag started to feel very heavy. And so he looked one way...
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And then he looked the other, and he put that big bag down, and then he dug both paws in, and threw a whole bunch of stones behind him one way, and a whole bunch the other way..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And of course, as soon as they hit the sky, they all began to twinkle behind him..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And then he picked that bag up, put it on his back again. Well it wasn't so heavy now. So he walked a little further, and a little further, but that bag began to feel heavy again..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,And he looked one way...
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And he looked the other way. And then he put that bag down, and he dug in again. Flung one paw full of stones one way, one the other way, and no one had seen him. But the sky was getting brighter behind him. He put that bag right up back on his back..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"Walked a little further. Well it felt good for about a minute or two, and then lazy coyote, he just couldn't stand it anymore. He looked one way, he looked the other, then he put that bag down, opened it real wide, and like a puppy digging a hole, he just dug, all of those stones, right out of that bag, until he got right down to the bottom. And all those stones, started sparkling behind him. Then he took that bag, made sure it was empty, folded it up, made a little pillow, pulled up a comfortable cloud, laid down, and went to sleep. Well, pretty soon the animals were running out of stones, they started calling... coyote, we need some more stones over here, right over... where are you coyote. Well..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"Coyote didn't hear them. Because he was lazy, and he was, asleep. Well, the first rays of morning, started peeking over the edge of the Earth, and all the animals had to scurry, back onto the Earth. Before day broke. Some of them had to leave their pictures, half done. Some had only had one stone. They could just put up in the sky. A few were finished, like the swan, and finally when a ray of light hit coyote in the eye, he woke up and, he realized, he too had to hurry back onto Earth. So he did. But that night, when he looked up at the sky, that's when he learned how to howl. Because he saw all the other animals with their pictures in the sky, and his wasn't there. Because he'd been lazy. And he had been asleep. And that's the story, of how all the stars got in the sky..."
54_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,Well...
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"Some of my favorite kinds of stories, are stories where the audience gets to help a little bit..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>

54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And I need you to be the tiger. Now this tiger keeps changing his mind about things, sometimes you're going to say, that's good said tiger. Can I hear you say that."

54_CYNT,"Alright. Well let's see, what keeps flipping this tiger back and forth. Shall we. Boy was sitting on a big rock. In the middle of the jungle. Just sitting. When along came tiger. Run boy. Said tiger. Run. And then, I will chase you. And I will catch you. And then, hm-hm-hm-hm. I will eat you. So run said tiger. Well said boy, Eat me then. I have no run left in me. What. You won't run. Tell me why you won't run... and then I will eat you. Said tiger. Well it's like this said the boy. I was walking. Just walking in the jungle when, I bumped into rhino. You know what a rhino is, don't you. A great big animal with a horn..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"Or rhino bumped into me. I was willing to forget it. But not rhino. So he got mad, and I ran away from there fast. Now this is where you say, that's good said tiger-. That's good said tiger."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"Well I ran, and I ran and I ran and I ran, but all the while, there was rhino. Running right after me. He can't see very well but, boy can he run fast. That's bad said tiger."
54_MANY,That's bad said tiger.
54_CYNT,"Well I ran and I ran and I ran and I ran, until I found a low tree. And I climbed up in that tree, and I sat on a branch, and rhino, he ran right under me, and he kept right on going. That's good said tiger."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"But, he came back looking for me. That's bad said tiger."
54_MANY,That's bad said tiger.
54_CYNT,"So I got down, and I picked up a stone, and I threw it at rhino to scare him away, That's good said tiger."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"But, it didn't scare him away."
54_MANY,That's bad said tiger.
54_CYNT,That's bad said tiger...
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"So I got down, and I ran a little more. A little slower now, because I was so tired but, at least rhino was getting tired too. That's good said tiger."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"And then, then, I was running, and I tripped, into a shallow ditch, right in front of rhino."
54_MANY,That's bad said tiger.
54_CYNT,That's bad said tiger.
54_AUD,Yes.
54_CYNT,"Well, but rhino was going so fast this time, he ran right over me. That's good said tiger."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"But I got up, and, there was rhino. Right there back again. That's bad said tiger."
54_MANY,That's bad said tiger.
54_CYNT,"So I ran and I ran, until I saw uh a vine... and I grabbed the vine, and I swung across the river, to the other side."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"That's good said tiger. But on the other side, was crocodile. With his mouth wide open."
54_MANY,That's bad said tiger.
54_CYNT,"That's bad said tiger. So I swang back, and I let go of the vine, and I landed with a thump, and I didn't see rhino anywhere."
54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"That's good said tiger. So I got down, and then I realized, I had been on rhino's back..."

54_MANY,That's good said tiger.
54_CYNT,"That's good said tiger. And then tiger said, And so then, you ran away. And you got away from rhino. And boy said, well. No, I was so tired, I just sat down here, and, and, and now I'm going to get behind this big stone, because, here comes rhino now."

54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"But the frog prince, who was sitting on his lily pad in the middle of the pond, huh, was he lonely. I mean the birds were flying above him, the fish were swimming below him, but no one was paying a bit of attention to him. When, who should he see, walking along the path with a book under her arm, but the most beautiful princess he had ever seen. Well uh, finally a little company. He said to himself..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"And he took off his little gold crown, put it next to him on the lily pad, hopped into the water, and swam across, poking his little head up through the reeds. Oh uh, pardon me. Beautiful princess, he said in his most pitiful and pathetic voice. But uh..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"I was wondering if, if you could help me. Well, the princess was quite surprised to be spoken to by a frog, but she felt so sorry for his pitiful and pathetic voice, that she said, Why, you dear little frog. Whatever can I can I do to help you. And he said, Oh, well you see, I am not really a frog. I am really a handsome prince. Who has been turned into a frog by, the spell of a wicked witch. And in order to break the spell, I must be kissed, by, a beautiful princess. Well, somehow the princess, had the feeling that he was gonna say that..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
54_CYNT,"But she looked down at him, and felt so sorry for him, and she thought, Well. What do I have to lose. And so, she reached down. And she picked him up, and she brought him right up close to her face... and she closed her eyes..."
54_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
