22_RAND,"Uh You know it's, it was really pretty straightforward this morning..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"And, y- z-. I thought you did a good job all the way through. I mean you were on top of what you were scanning."
22_LANC,Hm. Thanks...
22_RAND,Um.
22_LANC,"Should've kept that one Horizon, Fauker jet... just t- keep em on the right."
22_RAND,Why did you switch em.
22_LANC,"Well, uh, looking at something, I would get... it didn't seem like I could get someone else out. But, um, and, part of it to provide a good service, but then."
22_RAND,"Yeah... uh Well, uh that- that-. I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of... well, two eight's kinda nice sometimes, because, uh uh I mean when we're on ten, all the departures seemed like they're going out the left..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"So you really want your arrivals on the right. When you're landing two eight, then you can get departures off of, almost both at any time..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,So you always got a hole.
22_LANC,N yeah. Yeah.
22_RAND,"So, but uh, don't feel bad about keeping Horizon on the right, boy, because."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"Sure doesn't hurt them to taxi any. They're so used to having, A number one service."
22_LANC,Yeah... plus when they're departing.
22_RAND,Every one of em came.
22_LANC,"They're right by the gate. Everyone-... even, even one or-... one or two of em I said, I'll advise if the left becomes available... and they said w-."
22_RAND,And they... they still ask.
22_LANC,"We'd like the left, if it becomes available..."
22_RAND,"I know, they still ask..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,And Viking is the same way...
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"So. There's sh... there's sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though. Um, Traffic Watch Eight we discussed."
22_LANC,So radar service terminated.
22_RAND,"Um, call me inbound, or. You wanna say radar service terminated, frequency change approved. Report back inbound. Or, I I think that something a little little more like that's better, than just saying radar service terminated, because, he's kinda..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,Left hanging.
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"And you could just say, radar service terminated, report back inbound, and then he'll... he'll either come back and say, well I'm departing the area, now back to Hillsborrow, Or I'll call you back inbound. So that gives you an idea."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"But uh, and uh, uh Along with that, Let TC, do more of the work for you."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"You know, Um, just tell her what you want her to do..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"I was thinking of a couple instances, where you could've used her more than you did."
22_LANC,"Okay. I was thinking that for my rundowns, you know that would uh, that's... that would have been a help, but, on the other s- the other hand."
22_BILL,"I wanna get it on tape, heck of a job Lance..."
22_RAND,<NONVERBAL>
22_LANC,Oh thank you very much. Did you hear that... um.
22_RAND,"The problem with doing rundowns, is that it's kind of over in your face."
22_LANC,"Yeah, Yeah. So."
22_RAND,"Cause the D-light's kind of, pretty far over to the left there, but sh- you can, you can have her do it if you want."
22_LANC,"Um, I would. I'm just working at, doing as much of these other things as I possibly can, Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC, and just... just challenging myself."
22_RAND,And that's okay...
22_LANC,"Um, what were some of the things, other than... what- what were some of the things that, that I should have used her for that I didn't."
22_RAND,Depending on who your...
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"Who your TC is, if c- certain people sit down there, they d-... they have a tendency to do everything for you. And sometimes that is p-... that is really pretty nice. If you just, if you just, all you have to do is stand up, and look out the window, and look at the bright... and talk... uh You- no other w-... no other coordination, or, or ARTS functions, or anything, That really is nice."
22_LANC,That's ideal.
22_RAND,It it really helps.
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,The situation.
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"So, but, uh Right now, like you say, maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff..."
22_LANC,"um, I don't think there was, I mean I had, just a couple that I switched to the left, you know maybe three or so, that I switched to the left, uh p-... uh probably two or three, and so there was that, I didn't have any ARTS entries, I had, you know, Traffic Watch to slue out to..."
22_RAND,<NONVERBAL>
22_LANC,Um.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"For the most part, I mean I was able to k-. I think I was able to keep up with that stuff."
22_RAND,With the ARTS.
22_LANC,"Yeah. I mean, there wasn't really nothing much to do... um."
22_RAND,"No, there wasn't."
22_LANC,So.
22_RAND,But there could be.
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"If there's VFRs departing, or."
22_LANC,Yeah. I told her to do my VFR guys.
22_RAND,Oh Yeah.
22_LANC,"And um, to write down my VFRs... That's one thing I gotta kick myself to do."
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"Now are we still required to w-... write, like, the Empires that coming in through the gates VFR. Don't they. We are."
22_RAND,Any VFR...
22_LANC,"Now isn't that, aren't they when they c-. But what if they've... c- well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR, and then cancelled VFR."
22_RAND,"Well yeah, because they have a strip on it downstairs."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"So. I don't... uh actually, uh I'm like you, I don't really know what the point is of that. Because we do have a record of em anyway. But."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"Uh when the... when the... order came across or whatever, or this memorandum that said, to write down all VFR arrivals."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"So, if they're a VFR arrival, you're supposed to write it down."
22_LANC,Okay. I'll do that then.
22_RAND,Unhunh. When Horizon one-thirty-eight didn't answer you there.
22_LANC,Go back to ground.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,Or just move on to something else.
22_RAND,"I mean you tried him a couple times. You say Horizon one-thirty-eight, <XX>, if they don't get the hint, if he's... but if you can't get him, just go on... and do something else that you can do. United was calling ready to go."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"So, shoot... just let United go. Horizon."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"You can't do nothing with him, so just have him hold there. So just go on to the next."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"Next thing, and do tell ground. He might be still on ground frequency, which is..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"Uh, usually not too likely, because, you know."
22_LANC,At that point.
22_RAND,"At that point, well he's out there."
22_LANC,"You know, He's."
22_RAND,And he's probably sitting there...
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"And th- he's not hearing anything, from the tower you know."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"He's probably, looking at his radio about then."
22_LANC,"Yeah, I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that, cause I wanted to... had to plan, to get him out at that point... and, I should've been more flexible and."
22_RAND,"But uh, you know, everything else I saw, you- your separation was, was really good this morning. I mean you really tightened em up. Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight."
22_LANC,A little too tight...
22_RAND,"Cause uh, uh. I don't know, y- a couple times you had, like one just barely at departure end, a jet at departure, and you cleared another jet for takeoff. And it worked out great."
22_LANC,Oh. One guy out the right and then... oh th-... both guys out the left.
22_RAND,Both guys out to the left...
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"And it worked out good, but, uh I think it worked out because, this guy, was real slow, on on starting his departure roll. You know."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"Usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end... before you clear the next guy. And watch out for the uh, the seven-thirty-seven, four-hundreds."
22_LANC,"Four-hundreds, Okay."
22_RAND,Or three hundreds and.
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"Because uh uh, they'll really climb. And they can go fast, too."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"So, well you know, just take into consideration the type of aircrafts. It takes the seven-twenty-seven a little b- while to get wound up, while the seven-thirty-seven'll really go. But uh, uh. I mean it was really good. Good departure separation."
22_LANC,Thanks.
22_RAND,"I was impressed. And, you saw, a little bit about the two-sixty. Heading... uh Listen to the readbacks for."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"If I know he's at two-thirty. But you can wrap em around, to one-thirty or one-sixty, to avoid the MBA, and that works great, because, otherwise you got two-sixty. There was that one time you had... two south plan aircraft, and one westbound-... or, river, metro and."
22_LANC,Mhm...
22_RAND,<NONVERBAL>
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"I d-. I actually didn't think, you were gonna have three miles between the two first."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"South plan air lane, but you did. That was perfect."
22_LANC,The one that I kept on runway heading for a bit.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,Or.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"And that was good, it was real good planning, to keep that one Caravan on runway heading, when you had the other one going two-sixty. To ensure that you had, oh and you had the one going two-forty..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,Or something...
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,And then you had the Metro going s-... going two-sixty.
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"But you kept the Metro on, this runway heading. Which is really good planning. So."
22_LANC,"I'm. I'm... less and less impacted. For lack of a better word... by, these g-... for some reason, with all these, um, I think, the bulk of my planning, seems to revolve around these little guys, when I can turn em, fitting em in with all my other guys, for some reason, I mean y-, and that is, you know, those guys, having a very fec- affective part, in the whole fan, of all our departures. And um."
22_RAND,Hm.
22_LANC,"I think they're, they're a- affecting me less than they did in the past."
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,Does that make sense.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"Do you know what I mean. Um, cause i-... there was a time where, I mean that sequence was good too... but there was a time when, yeah an i-... it it may happen again."
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"Who knows... where I've got, the little West Coasts in here, and all these guys off the right and left, where am I actually gonna fit these guys in, and they're all calling, they're ready way early. And."
22_RAND,"Well the sequence, uh, can't be too bad. When you got... when you can feed from charley..."
22_LANC,<XX>.
22_RAND,"And from bravo, and from alpha. You know uh, the sequence can't be too bad, I mean all he did."
22_LANC,You got something you can do.
22_RAND,Yeah. All he did is send em all out. I mean you got all the West Coasts in the row over on charley...
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"You got the jets in a row on bravo, and you got n- various things over here. So, you can pick and choose. You know, y-. I mean as a ground control, you can just send em all out there, and then, when they get there, then you can start arranging the strips..."
22_LANC,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,"You know, the way you want, almost."
22_LANC,Yeah...
22_RAND,"You know th-, that's."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"That, it works great. That way."
22_LANC,"Because you don't have to sequence em at some other point, in their taxi route, you know."
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"They're b-... they... e... essentially on their own taxiway, up through... up to the approach end. So."
22_RAND,"So that was about all... that I... you know, that I had. I mean, I was paying pretty close attention there, and I didn't really see much of a problem."
22_LANC,Oh. Thanks.
22_RAND,"No significant problems... <XX>, to talk about."
22_LANC,I'm glad.
22_RAND,"See there was, S-. Oh um, don't always, uh um, don't insist on always saying, seven hundred. If you say."
22_LANC,Oh.
22_RAND,Why hadn't you.
22_LANC,"At some point after he is leaving seven, just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you mean."
22_RAND,Sometimes you can do that.
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"Yeah. There was a couple times, you didn't need to say it when, when you did."
22_LANC,It was out in the... yeah.
22_RAND,Yeah. Well I mean y- w-.
22_LANC,Could've either waited just a bit.
22_RAND,It was at. He was at a five-hundred climb and.
22_LANC,"Or, he was a-."
22_RAND,"Just go ahead and say, turn left heading one six zero."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"Or turn left heading two six zero. For a Metro. I mean if you leave em on runway heading, for a little bit."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"They're gonna be at the altitude you need so, but that's no big deal. And uh, I was watching Jet Speed come in, and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"It seemed like you were a little tense with that but, really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in. He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there. Did you see that."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,So that... that worked out great.
22_RAND,I wondered if you'd saw-. Yeah. I mean there was lots of room. Lots of time.
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"He wasn't, he z- wasn't flying as a normal."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"For some reason, he just used the."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"Or is it uh, Exec Jet. One of those guys is usually really fast."
22_LANC,Jet Speed is th- I know fast on the pr- departure.
22_RAND,AM-Flight.
22_LANC,It seems.
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"Uh I think. It seems like that was the one, but, yeah AM-Flight, when they fly the later jet. Um, yeah. And I think I might have said for delta niners or to, no delay, or something like that and."
22_RAND,Yeah. I think you did...
22_LANC,And he was actually floating at... uh the Jet Speed wasn't... yeah.
22_RAND,"Yeah, you had a lot of time."
22_LANC,Yeah.
22_RAND,"When the Twins get airborne, you got a jet following, the twin- twin's gonna go southwestbound. If you got six-thousand feet, and the twin's climbing out of four or five hundred, you can start your transmission, then to the, to the jet."
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"Twin Cesna ahead is, will be turning southwestbound, momentarily, runway two eight left clear for takeoff. It says in sight."
22_LANC,Just didn't wanna be sure he gets his turn in.
22_RAND,Mhm...
22_LANC,Okay.
22_RAND,"The Caravan's coming across, if you wanna get."
22_LANC,"Yeah what do you say. Cause I've heard different phraseology, and I af- feel like I was stumbling over that, I think I said it-, couple different ways."
22_RAND,"A mile west, or something. I'll- I just say, uh you know on a day like this, it's so easy to see em, I would just say the Caravan ahead, is southwestbound. Runway two eight left, clear for takeoff. And and they'll, a lot of times they'll say uh in sight. If they don't say in sight, they'll say, uh they'll, I would assume they have em in sight, because they won't go."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"Unless they seem em. I mean that's important to them, to see the traffic... but it's safe, it's a safe operation. Because, uh one thing, you could do, is is turn the Caravan to two-forty..."
22_LANC,Mhm.
22_RAND,"To get him across. And then, just before you ship em, send em back to two-fifty <XX> something like that."
22_LANC,Hm...
22_RAND,"Cause the track's what im- what's important. But, but two-fifty was working out fine today. Fifteen degrees and a mile. Is what you need so, or less... using visual."
22_LANC,"Yeah, In fact it was a, Was the West Coast that... was it the Horizon who said he could do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead, or was it vice versa, one of the two..."
22_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
22_RAND,Yeah.
22_LANC,"And at that point I said, don't need it now... They got it."
22_RAND,Somebody in there.
22_LANC,"I think Laura went in there, yeah."
22_BILL,"Comm, line for you... <XX> have a call on the other line."
22_RAND,This is Randy. Okay. NA
