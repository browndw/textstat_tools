56_GARY,I've never heard of it. So.
56_JULI,"P- he uh. That's what I need to know, he said if there was a prior brand inspection, then he would have to go off of that one."
56_MATT,Trash.
56_JULI,If there was no prior brand inspection...
56_MATT,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"Then he could just go off of this, and issue me a new one."
56_GARY,"If. Is there a brand inspection, if we bring one in from out of state."
56_JULI,"Well, she said since it was not required in California when she bought the pony, which it is now, they reinstated it about a year ago."
56_GARY,Oh.

56_GARY,Oh.
56_JULI,"But, if she didn't."

56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,And they look like this. In. In either pink or blue...
56_ENV,<NONVERBAL>

56_GARY,Department of Agriculture. I guess. Okay.

56_GARY,And what do you call that. That's uh.
56_JULI,Well it's.
56_GARY,State Board of Stock Inspection.
56_JULI,"You know it doesn't cost much to do it, but it is a law... and."
56_KARE,So long.
56_JULI,You leaving.
56_KARE,Mm.
56_JULI,"Pull your horse in h-. You wouldn't believe how good he felt, when I took him out to grass this morning. He was dancing on the end of the lead rope, And arch."
56_KARE,Cause he knew where he was going.
56_JULI,But he did it on the way up- back too.
56_KARE,Oh.
56_JULI,"He had his neck arched, and he's just like vibrating with energy."
56_KARE,Oh good. Maybe I should go out and ride him now.
56_JULI,I guess you should.
56_KARE,Woo...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_KARE,Bye...
56_JULI,Bye. Did you see my patio I'm putting in. Look how much is done now.
56_KARE,Oh it's a patio. I thought you were gonna grass it.
56_JULI,No. I told you I'm gonna do a flagstone patio.
56_KARE,You told me you were gonna grass it.
56_JULI,That's why I took out all these rocks over here. That's my roommate Karen.
56_KARE,Oh.
56_GARY,Okay. Is.
56_KARE,Well I never know what you're gonna do from week to week...
56_JULI,<NONVERBAL>
56_GARY,"Okay, uh, it's a law, Who's supposed to do this. The buyer or the seller or, or what. I don't know."
56_JULI,I think the seller is supposed to.
56_GARY,Oh.
56_JULI,"Usually the seller's supposed to pay for it, but I just, I just do it and I pay for it, it doesn't really make that much difference to me, cause it's only like seven bucks. To do it."
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,"But, if she ha-... uh I mean it's not a big deal, I just need to know if she had one done or didn't have one done."
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,Cause it'll make a difference on what the brand inspecttor does.
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,"If she did have one done, I need to know about when. If she can't find the copy. So they can look it up."
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,And I doubt if they're terribly computerized...
56_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"Cause I had this happen once before, when I lost the brand inspection on a horse I'd bought, but I remembered the month that I bought it in. And I happened to buy it out at the auction. It was one of my."
56_KARE,There's a movie sitting on the desk out there.
56_JULI,What is it.
56_KARE,The Substitute Wife.
56_JULI,Oh. Was that any good.
56_KARE,It was very good.
56_JULI,Oh good. You mean Farrah Fawcett has learned to act.
56_KARE,Didn't we see. Well it was funny.
56_JULI,Oh okay.
56_KARE,It was different. I don't know how realistic it was.
56_JULI,I just didn't think she looked the part of a plains wife.
56_KARE,But it was different. No.
56_JULI,No...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Too many teeth and hair.
56_KARE,Bye...
56_GARY,"Well, Th-... okay this is what you get, and the guy hands it to you."
56_JULI,"Mhm, Yeah."
56_GARY,Okay. I have no idea. So I'll have to ask her.
56_JULI,And s-. I'm the. Okay I'm the agent. Let's see this is gonna go to the owner. So yeah. The owner would have the blue copy. The a- I was the agent on this horse. I'm not the owner.
56_GARY,So.
56_JULI,But course.
56_GARY,The.
56_JULI,"We got him last July. So it's been almost a year, I just. I just can't bear to bring the brand inspector out for just one horse, because it's only like seven bucks, now this one was seventeen, because, he's getting a permanent brand inspection. Which you can keep, for the, for as long as you own the horse."
56_GARY,What is a brand inspection.
56_JULI,"But it's. What it is is your only legal bill of sale, for horse or cattle, in the State of Colorado."
56_GARY,Oh.
56_JULI,Registration.
56_GARY,It's like registering a car.
56_JULI,Right. And and.
56_GARY,"Or or uh, not registering, but uh, passing title."
56_JULI,Mhm.
56_GARY,To a car.
56_JULI,"And, see the thing is, what makes it good, uh is if you don't have a legal brand inspection. On a horse when you take him to the auction, you can't run him through the auction, they will impound the horse."
56_GARY,Wow.
56_JULI,"So, if somebody goes and forges..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"A little bill of sale that looks like this, and steals a horse out of my pasture, and takes it to the auction, they're gonna impound the horse and check it out. Look for identifying marks. And not send that horse to the killers."
56_GARY,Oh okay. Okay.
56_JULI,That's why it's real important.
56_GARY,"Yeah... uh How do you uh, I guess you just look it up in the phone book, for uh."
56_JULI,Well you usually you can- you can.
56_GARY,Colorado State Department of Agriculture or something...
56_JULI,I can never find it in the phone book. Call the vet. All the vets know the number.
56_GARY,Vet.
56_JULI,Of the brand inspector.
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,"And I have it on file too. His name is um, our our current brand inspector is a real cutie. Let's see. What's his name. Bart Zuckerman. Is our current brand inspector."
56_GARY,Okay.

56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,"I had a hard time getting hold of him this time, his uh answering machine wasn't working."

56_JULI,"He is a cutie. I mean he he's. He models for Shepler's magazine. Really nice looking young fellow. I don't know. He's got-. I think he's got a couple kids. But, very nice. Polite cowboy type... And on our last."
56_GARY,Alright.
56_JULI,I just get used to a brand inspector and they switch em on us...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"Donald Bradbury was our brand inspector for years. And um, I mean, he knew me real well because I, I'd go through seven eight horses a year out here and."
56_GARY,Wow.
56_JULI,Well.
56_GARY,What do you what do you do here.
56_JULI,Cause I'm an. I'm an agent. I teach riding lessons.
56_GARY,Oh.
56_JULI,"And I buy and sell, and I'm an agent."
56_GARY,Oh.
56_JULI,"I'll. I'll find horses for people, that."
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,And so I act as an agent.
56_GARY,So you match a a a customer with a horse.
56_JULI,Yeah it's sorta like a dating service. It's wonderful.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,It's really a lotta fun.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,Yeah.
56_GARY,"So they know that, that you can do this, so they tell you, hey, I really need this kind of a horse."
56_JULI,Right...
56_GARY,<XX>.
56_JULI,Well uh m-. Most of the time it's my students. And when they're ready to buy a horse.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,Then I look for a horse for em.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"Like with uh Peggy's horse, I looked at twenty-eight horses in ten days..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Before I found the one that I thought would suit her...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,And she's a wonderful horse. And I didn't even dicker on the price for her. Because I thought the price was so good.
56_GARY,Mhm...
56_JULI,"<XX>, And we paid twenty-five hundred for her. And she was a nine-year-old Anglo Arab, Um, about fifteen three, lovely mare. She's cleaning up in competitive trail and, and doing reasonably well at the shows.

56_MATT,So what were. What was happening to him... <XX>.

56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Hopefully he's almost full-grown...
56_MATT,Yeah.
56_JULI,"Cause, cause male Great Danes can get upwards of a hundred and seventy-five pounds."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,And I don't want him to get that big. Hi Hap. That's Hap. He's one of those wild thoroughbreds.

56_GARY,What is that.
56_JULI,"It's a granary, it holds about four-thousand pounds of grain."
56_GARY,Oh. Wow.
56_JULI,Yeah. I have.
56_GARY,I've never seen anybody had one of those at a barn.
56_JULI,Well I feed between twenty and twenty-five horses all year round...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,So I can't buy it by the sack...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,I go through.
56_MATT,They have trucks come out here.
56_JULI,Yeah I go through about three-hundred pounds a day.
56_GARY,Oh man...
56_MATT,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,I go through ten.
56_GARY,Incredible.
56_JULI,"Ten to twelve tons of hay a month. Roughly, ten to twelve thousand dollars a year of hay."
56_GARY,You must have been hurting this last season. Hunh.
56_JULI,"No actually, my hay supplier was real good to me."
56_GARY,How did you do that. I mean it was hard for everybody.
56_JULI,"I've been buying hay, I've been buying hay from Bartlett's, for six years now... and I don't. I'm not his biggest customer, but I've been real steady and real loyal."
56_GARY,We had a r-.
56_JULI,And I've referred him to a lotta people. And um.
56_GARY,"We had a lotta, we had a."
56_JULI,He kept my hay price.
56_GARY,Shortage of hay this year. Because of uh.
56_JULI,He. Yeah.
56_GARY,It was the floods out in.
56_JULI,"But see he knows how much... he buys a lotta hay, he's a broker. And he buys hay, And actually I usually get the Wyoming hay, and it got ruined in the rain. So I was getting West Cliff hay, which I don't think is quite as good, it's good. But not quite as good."
56_GARY,Unhunh.
56_JULI,But he kept my hay price down to a hundred and twenty-five dollars a ton.
56_GARY,Which is how much.
56_JULI,All winter. Delivered and stacked.
56_GARY,Wow. Was that a.
56_JULI,Which is really good.
56_GARY,What does that boil down to per bale.
56_JULI,"Well he was selling it to other people, that came and picked it up, for a hundred and sixty-five. A ton. But I get twenty-two to twenty-five tons at a time..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,He just brings a semi-load in here.
56_GARY,I'll bet. What does that boil down to per bale.
56_JULI,There's Shiba.
56_GARY,Do you know. No.
56_JULI,"No it. It's roughly, anywhere from twenty-eight to thirty, um, bales per ton. But, I always buy by the ton, because then I know how much feed I have."
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"You know, when you buy this much, you can't go by the bale. It's kinda silly."
56_GARY,"Yeah, right."
56_JULI,See there's Shiba.
56_GARY,Yeah. Hey Shiba...
56_JULI,Come here girl...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"Are you sleepy. And that's her boyfriend Beamer. He's so. He's so happy, he thinks he has a whole mare herd now to protect."
56_GARY,Alright.
56_MATT,Hm.
56_JULI,She's been in high heat the last couple days...
56_MATT,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,He thinks that's wonderful.
56_GARY,Shiba's been in heat.
56_JULI,Oh yeah. See how she. See what she's doing. Squirting on him.
56_GARY,Oh yuck.
56_JULI,"Miserable old mare... He likes it, This one's in heat too, and he won't pay any attention to her, and she's really frustrated. Cause poor mare, she's been off her feet for two days because, Beamer rushes the fence, and bears his teeth, and, pins his ears at her, because he d-. He doesn't want her to get next to his mare. He keeps himself between his mare and, and that one, who might threaten his mare herd..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"He's really a funny character. I give lessons on him too, he's privately owned but, his owner doesn't ride him much. And he's real gentle. He um, he was shown out in California..."
56_GARY,<XX>.
56_JULI,He... he rides Western English and drives. He pulls a cart.
56_GARY,Wow.
56_JULI,And he's just as cute as can be. He's a little Morgan.
56_GARY,They're identical color aren't they.
56_JULI,Unhunh. And she's just sure that this one's going to be it. Actually he's doing better than my stallion.
56_GARY,Wow.
56_JULI,My stallion can't get it figured out...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"He's only three. And we tried breeding him to a mare the other day, and she was going out of heat, wasn't very strong, And he was just a lot more interested in the Gelding next to her, and I said, this is what I need is a gay stallion..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,<NONVERBAL>
56_MATT,<NONVERBAL>
56_GARY,A gay stallion.
56_JULI,"Oh I said, well, that way at least I don't have to worry about gelding him. And he'll keep his pretty coat, you know we just won't worry about him. And he's real even tempered but... uh We just had his first foal. He did manage to breed my old mare last year. But she's really experienced. And I just turned em out to pasture together for three days, and she was patient with him."
56_MATT,Hm.
56_JULI,But then he fell in love with her and it was...
56_HORS,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"He was. Um, what do you call it. He only wanted the one mare. He wouldn't look at any of the others last year. So we didn't get anybody else bred last year. But two is a little young to be asking anything. Watch this now. Watch him rush at her... rush at her. See if he goes. See and her buddy, um, the reason she's here, this black mare, she's here for board and training, she hadn't been ridden in five years. And her um, pal of ten ye-, ten years had to be put down a few weeks ago. He just was so crippled up and old and."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"Suffering and, she didn't want to keep the mare at home, after they put the other horse down, cause she figured she'd get frantic. So she came here to have more friends. To make friends."
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,Well these are.
56_GARY,So what did you do to your arena.
56_JULI,"Um, well last year I put in a whole new ring. I spent about three thousand dollars leveling it. Because it wasn't quite level, I. I'd had it leveled when I moved here, but it w- really wasn't level."
56_GARY,Mhm.
56_JULI,"And the sand that I had in it uh. There was natural sand in it when I bought the place, It had all washed down the road, and I p- think Kettle Creek scooped it up and put it in their ring, So it was hard as a rock..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"And it kept washing out. And it was terrible and, like riding on asphalt. So, I had."
56_GARY,Well you were probably down to the hardpack.
56_JULI,I was down to clay.
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"And I had Havens come out, and... with a bulldozer. And he leveled the whole thing, he took a whole bunch out of this corner you can see."
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,And put it down in that corner.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"And, it just was a lot nicer. And then I had, three-hundred tons of sand brought in and spread..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"It was great in the winter time. When it was all frozen, and I had this much soft stuff on top... but when it thawed, we couldn't ride in it, it was this deep."
56_GARY,Oh.
56_JULI,It was horrid. And the horses have had a hard time.
56_GARY,Too much.
56_JULI,"So today. Finally it's been dry enough for Tad to come out and, and take the rest of the sand off. And I sold it to him."
56_GARY,Oh he was taking it out.
56_JULI,He was taking it out.
56_GARY,"Oh okay, I saw the big dumptruck."
56_JULI,"Yeah. Well, that was Havens was taking it out. Um, Orville Havens... and uh his son. Which I can't remember his name. Starts with an el. Lenny or something."
56_GARY,And he was taking it to someplace else.
56_JULI,"Lenny and Orville. He was taking it to one of my students, who lives on the road behind me, who put in a ring but didn't have any sand yet."
56_GARY,Okay. Okay.
56_JULI,"So she got a great deal. She got about a third of my sand, that I paid, twelve or thirteen-hundred dollars for delivered, and she got it a-, got about a third of it, for about two-hundred and fifty bucks."
56_GARY,Hey that's good.
56_JULI,And so it was a lot cheaper than if she'd bought it.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"Cause I only charged her, a buck, a buck a ton, which is what I paid for it. But then I had to pay a lot more to have it hauled in."
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,The hauling is what costs so much. But I'll sh-.
56_GARY,"So uh, yeah, you know, My, my arena isn't very level."
56_JULI,"Well it cost her a lot less to level hers, but it wasn't as big as mine, or as unlevel. This is my tractor. It's masquerading as an Isuzu. But it really is my tractor..."
56_GARY,Foggy meadows.
56_JULI,"My handyman did that. I haven't seen him for a while, I think he quit. And didn't tell me. That's my roommate. One of my roommate's horses is here, and one's in there but, he's hiding. And then, this is the field. This is what we call the witch field, the mares live out there, they get turned out there during the day, and then that's the gelding field, and my stallion lives out with the geldings, And Bruge stands here half the day wanting to come in, and then after he goes in he wants to go out..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,He's like a lotta people's children in the winter time.
56_GARY,The mare field and the gelding field.
56_JULI,And the Chestnut. You see a dark grey on this side. And then a chestnut with his tail to us.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"The chestnut is my stallion. And he's just as mellow as. He's mellower than most geldings. He's a sweetheart. And the mare and baby, are up the road, a half mile, If you go through the gateposts. Th- where it says Stray Winds Two. And just go through there and look to your left, there's a pasture. And I've got the mare and baby up there in a seven-acre pasture."
56_GARY,Wow.
56_JULI,And we've got.
56_GARY,Wow.
56_JULI,"Right now we're down to twenty horses here. Which is great. And then, my roommate's old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too. He's um, had a real rough year, he had cancer, and, he lost one eye, and the other eye is going blind, and this'll probably be his last summer and."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"She's not riding him a whole lot. But he's still pretty happy. So we'll put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer, and, see how he is in the fall. And if he's, if he's, looks like he's gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally, we'll put him down in the fall. I'm not gonna let him wander around blind. It's not fair to him. He's been a grand horse. But none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life."
56_GARY,Where do they go.
56_JULI,"They get put down, and then either buried or just hauled off. But we put em down at home. I don't. I don't put them through going out to the sale and, being menh- manhandled, and stuck in semi trucks, and scared to death at the l- end of their lives. I just."
56_GARY,Hm.
56_JULI,"Don't believe in that. That's probably why I'll always be poor. But I do a lotta horse rescue. I've bought a lot from the killers. Um, in fact, this black horse of my roommate's came from, he was going to the killer's four years ago. Not this one. The one that is b- blind now. And he was considered a killer. An unmanageable. And he's been perfectly lovely, I give the little kids lessons on him."
56_GARY,Hm.
56_JULI,"So, I've had him four years. Sold him to my roommate a couple years ago, it was her second horse. And uh, they've cleaned up in competitive trail and, just had a great time and, fox hunted him and, He's just real game."
56_GARY,Hm.
56_JULI,"He's a purebred Arabian. All black. And he's just great. And uh, an- nother one I saved from the killers, three years ago, the light chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us."
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"He's a mustang. And he was four years old going to the killers out at Calhan, and he was way down on the sales list, and he was pretty spooky. So I m-. I had eight horses at the time, so I made one of my customers buy him. I said he's gonna make a wonderful hunt horse, when he gets broke..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"And he did. And he's absolutely lovely, and he now belongs to a sixteen-year-old girl, who competes him in, hunter jumper."
56_GARY,Gees.
56_JULI,"Naytrack, and she hunts him."
56_GARY,That's great.
56_JULI,"And she does dressage on him. And he jumps great, he does dressage, he does everything you ask him to do, except drive. We tried driving him, I used to h- h-."
56_GARY,"Driving as in, putting... loading him."
56_JULI,Driving him with a cart.
56_GARY,Oh. With a cart...
56_JULI,<NONVERBAL>
56_GARY,"Mean, making you pull a wagon."
56_JULI,"Yes, making him pull a cart."
56_GARY,Oh okay. Okay.
56_JULI,Well we did all the groundwork.
56_GARY,There's.
56_JULI,"This horse was doing great on the ground, we'd harnessed him, We'd been doing for two years. You know, let's break this horse to drive. Cause he's part Belgian. He's pretty cute. He's about a quarter Belgian. And he came from around Reno Nevada. And uh, so we did all the groundwork, just had a great time with him, and I had this guy come out that drives Belgians and, and he was gonna put in fence posts, but the ground was too frozen. So, he said well I don't have anything else to do, and I told him about this horse, he said let me see this horse. And he had Belgians, he said wow, he does look like a baby Belgian. He's real cute. And he asked me what I'd done to him and..."
56_GARY,Baby Bel-.
56_JULI,"And I said well, we've done all this groundwork, we've drug a drag with him, and he's doing really good-. So he put the harness on, checked it all out for me, cause I don't know as, that much about it, which is why I'd never hooked him to a cart. We just played on the ground. And um, he said well, everything's good here, and he drove him around, put the drag on him, he said oh, this horse is ready to drive, I said are you sure. I said when this horse spooks, it's a pretty tremendous spook."
56_GARY,Hm.
56_JULI,"I said and you don't want him to spook. He said nah, he's gonna be just fine. He hooked him to the cart, He got in, told me let go, I stepped back two steps, the horse took two steps, bucked, kicked the guy out of the cart, took off, the barn door was open. This used to be set up a little differently. Um..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"This fence went straight across and, this was one big field. And I had a different gate. Because, he destroyed it. He came out the end of the barn, jumped a four-and-a-half-foot gate..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"The cart of course, smashed the gate. And he went tearing around this whole field, with all the other horses in here, for probably ten minutes. And he jumped."
56_GARY,"With paraphernalia, probably straps hanging to him, right."
56_JULI,No. The cart was still attached...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,The cart was still attached.
56_GARY,The cart went through the gate. Gee.
56_JULI,"The c- uh the cart went through the gate, knocked the gate flat..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,I-. It was one of the aluminum type- type gates...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Like that little one...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Only it was the big one.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,"And it was flat, it was mushed, that's why I had to get a new gate. And uh."
56_GARY,Incredible.
56_JULI,"Well I've replaced fences since then. But he went tearing around, scared all the other horses to death, and there was a section down there which, used to be a part of a fence, You can see it. See the part tha-. It just makes kind of a upside-down U."
56_GARY,Yeah. Yeah.
56_JULI,"He jumped that with the cart too, and knocked it over, I mean, he cleared it. But the cart knocked it over. And sent that all flying. And finally the cart's wheels got smashed enough, that it just wasn't dragging too well anymore, and he was dragging dead weight. And he fi-, he stopped up on top of this hill, and I was going holy cow."
56_GARY,Golly day.
56_JULI,"And in the meantime-, I had a little mini about this big that was out there, and he got trampled by the other horses. He was okay."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"He was on Bute for a couple days. And he liked it. Real strange. Give me my Bute... All other horses hate it. But he got tram-. He had hoof prints on his shoulder and ribs. And another horse, was permanently lame after th-. He was, borderline lame anyway, he was doing walk trot and that's all, an old lame Appaloosa, but he broke a bone in his foot. He just. He made a sharp turn. On the hill, and just. He broke off a piece of his side bone. So he's retired totally now. Just getting fat and not working."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"And uh, but."
56_GARY,So much for uh carts.
56_JULI,"I walked up there, and, hoping he wouldn't run over me, with what was left of the cart. And I took a knife with me, and I was a-. And I didn't have to use it, I was able to just unhook everything pretty quick, and let him out of the shafts. And um, he h-. The only injury he had, And part of the time the shafts, and it's a metal cart, the shaft was under his belly, and in between his front legs, and I thought, he's gonna tear himself apart."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"Not a mark on his hind legs. He had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here, Small tiny puncture wound. But it swelled up like that. He did a lotta bruising and muscle damage."
56_GARY,Mm.
56_JULI,"And um, the vet happened to be out, yeah I think he was. He came out about an hour la ter, and I showed him what had happened, and he said yeah, he'll be out for six weeks. Which was the b- rest of the hunt season. He hunted two weekends later, and was never ever lame..."
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Never lame. He's really tough. And for three weeks.
56_GARY,Hi.
56_JACK,How are you.
56_JULI,After I took... after that. When I take the cay- hay cart out. To feed the horses. They'd all run and scare and spook...
56_GARY,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,Cause it sounded just like that pony cart.
56_GARY,I'll be darned. I tell you what.
56_JACK,When do you need to go.
56_GARY,Forget that cart.
56_JULI,"I don't need. Oh. Um, shoot. I need to go now."
56_JACK,Okay.
56_JULI,Okay.
56_JACK,I'm just gonna put this away. I'll just ride Canso tomorrow.
56_JULI,Okay.
56_JACK,"Um, I can stay after the lesson and work some <XX>."
56_JULI,Alright. God I didn't know it was so late.
56_JACK,It's okay.
56_JULI,But I have to go. That's right. Anyway. This is my barn.
56_GARY,Okay.
56_JULI,And then then I have another barn down here and.
56_JACK,This is her barn.
56_JULI,"And, These are the turn-outs, there's only five-and-a-half acres. But it's pretty well arranged."
56_JACK,I'm her slave.
56_JULI,This is my slave for the summer.
56_GARY,"You're her slave, oh alright, that's good..."
56_JACK,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,"There's a tack room, oh you did great slave."
56_JACK,Doesn't it look good.
56_JULI,It looks wonderful.
56_GARY,Wow... you did that.
56_JACK,My name is Jackie.
56_JULI,She cleaned it.
56_JACK,It's not really slave.
56_JULI,This is Jackie.
56_GARY,"Hi, Jackie slave. Alright."
56_JULI,This.
56_JACK,Yeah.
56_GARY,That looks nice.
56_JACK,You wanna look through it.
56_GARY,My wife wants a a tack room.
56_JULI,"This is Matt, and this is, I'm sorry."
56_GARY,Gary.

56_GARY,That's nice.
56_JACK,Well.
56_JULI,And this is.
56_JACK,No it. It wouldn't look right if this left.
56_GARY,"What do you use to put your... put your uh, these are real."
56_JACK,I'm gonna p-.
56_GARY,Yeah.
56_JULI,Saddleracks.
56_GARY,Those are real racks.
56_JULI,"Yeah, they're only about twelve bucks apiece."
56_GARY,"We have uh, a triple rack."
56_JULI,Mhm.
56_GARY,But I haven't hooked it up yet. Since we moved.
56_JACK,If you want me to do that lesson schedule for you.
56_JULI,"And it's only been three years a-. Yeah, maybe you can do that."
56_JACK,I'll do it. I mean it's.
56_JULI,Clean that up and.
56_JACK,It's kinda old.
56_JULI,"Fix it, I. I really need a keeper. I need an organizer to keep me straight..."
56_JACK,<NONVERBAL>
56_JULI,It's awful in the summer...
56_JACK,<XX>.
56_JULI,"I get terrible. This is the other tack room. It doesn't look quite as nice, Elaine's mess is still a mess in there."
56_JACK,Yeah.
56_JULI,But I'm gonna get her a tack trunk of some kind for her birthday.
56_GARY,Looks nice. That looks nice.
56_JACK,This rubber bit right here is Canso's bridle.
56_JULI,Mhm.
56_JACK,We got it out <XX> <XX>.
56_GARY,"See, this is a real barn Matt. Our barn isn't real. This is..."
56_JACK,<NONVERBAL>

56_JULI,And the location.
56_JACK,Yeah.
56_JULI,Not for the house...
56_GARY,<XX>.
56_JULI,"The house is a piece of garbage, but, you know I'm getting attached to it."
56_JACK,The inside is starting to look nice.
56_JULI,The only thing that was done well on that house.
56_JACK,Because you're decorating it.
56_JULI,Was the masonry work though. Hm.
56_JACK,It's starting to look nice on the inside.
56_JULI,"Yeah. Is it. Do you have enough time to br-... uh run me by the vet clinic, before we go pick up my truck, because they close at five thirty."
56_JACK,I'm fine.
56_JULI,Okay.
