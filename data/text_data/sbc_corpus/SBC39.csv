39_KIRS,"Um, first of all, maybe you guys, can tell me, we talked a little bit about it, last time you were here. Or did we not, talk about the history of the penguins."
39_AMY,Thanks.
39_DON,I wasn't here that weekend.
39_LORI,No. No.
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_LORI,We talked about the endangered species.
39_KIRS,Okay. We have...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"On exhibit now, about twenty-five of the thirty penguin chicks."
39_AMY,Wow...
39_KIRS,That you have...
39_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Um.
39_LORI,Oops...
39_KIRS,"Last year, I s- want to say around Christmas time, we went down, the Shed Aquarium, as well as other researchers and scientists, went down to Antarctica, to collect."
39_LORI,Mm.
39_KIRS,"Gentu penguin eggs. Okay, so, I want to go into a little bit about, the history of the Gentus here, um, for you-. For Don and Lori, where. Where did our original Gentu penguins come from."
39_DON,"Uh, Faulklands. Wasn't it."
39_KIRS,"Where did the. But, specifically."
39_DON,"Oh specifically, in the islands."
39_KIRS,"Where did we get them, for display here at the Shed Aquarium."
39_DON,"Oh. From the um, was it Edinburgh uh Zoo."
39_KIRS,Yeah. Great.
39_DON,Yeah.
39_KIRS,In Scotland.
39_DON,Yeah. Right.
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_AMY,Are those the ones that don't like people. The hands-off ones.
39_KIRS,Hands-off ones.
39_AMY,That came from. Where's Ten from.
39_KIRS,There.
39_AMY,Or is that. Oh okay.
39_KIRS,Yeah.
39_AMY,Well is. What's the other species.
39_KIRS,Rockhoppers.
39_AMY,The. No.
39_KIRS,Magellanics.
39_DON,Magellanic...
39_LORI,<XX>.
39_AMY,Yeah. Okay.
39_KIRS,"Ra-. Magellanics came, from the John Ball Zoo, in Grand Rapids Michigan."
39_DON,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"So, the Gentus, which. I take it you work mammals as well."
39_AMY,Yeah.
39_KIRS,"Okay, so feel free to add in."
39_AMY,"I worked with the baby penguins, when, cause I've only worked like a weekend, but both days were spent with the penguins. Feeding the baby penguins and then, Ten and, all of them."
39_KIRS,"Great. Great. So, feel free, after I've go through this information, you know..."
39_LORI,<XX>.
39_KIRS,Share any information you might have.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_AMY,Well I'll probably have a lot of questions for you...
39_KIRS,From your experiences.
39_AMY,Okay.
39_KIRS,"Cause that's, uh you know."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"Usually the best way that we can get, some good detailed information is from, volunteers, that actually work, uh in mammals. So, we love that. Um, anyway, so, we got the penguins, our original batch of penguins, from, from this zoo in Scotland, uh and, um, you know, as you know, you ship them over, and they go into a quarantine period. And, I do believe it was thirty days. Don't don't, it's in my literature right there, I'll check for certain. Uh, that is required by the USDA, basically there's, there's a disease called n- Newcastle's Disease, that, is is very uh- contagious apparently, and so there's always the potential, of, when you bring a bird over, contamidate-. Contaminating the poultry."
39_AMY,Mm.
39_KIRS,"Business. Okay, and so that is, th- background information, for the reason for quarantining. Um, with our uh- other penguins, uh we brought them over, from Scotland, and, as it turned out, in a quarantine period that they had, that a vi-... or I should say a fungus, okay this Aspergillosis fungus, had come to fruition, and we had lost, you know a good portion of penguins. So."
39_AMY,Wow.
39_KIRS,"Okay, now it's time to consider replacing these penguins, how do we want to go about doing that. Well, really didn't want to go, through, transporting the birds. Didn't work last time, a potential for bringing over diseases, is obviously there, so, the thought was okay let's get some eggs. Um, Sea World San Diego has Gentus, and, apparently just not enough eggs to share. If they had them they would gladly. Same situation with the Edinburgh Zoo, they would gladly send us birds, but, they didn't feel that they had enough eggs, to send over. So, we really didn't want to go the bird route, and so, that left us the choice of going down to Antarctica, and collecting some peng-... some penguin eggs ourselves. So they went to, and I don't know if this is pronounced correctly, Wiencke Island."
39_LORI,"Yeah, that's where a lot of seals are from as well."
39_DON,Hm.
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,Cool.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,Cool.
39_DON,That'll fit in with your class.
39_LORI,I know...
39_KIRS,Yeah.
39_ALIC,Nicole is here.
39_KIRS,"Hi, Nicole."
39_NICO,Hi.
39_ALIC,Hey let me.
39_KIRS,How you doing.
39_ALIC,Can I just interrupt for one minute.
39_NICO,Oh okay.
39_ALIC,Can I see your ID.
39_NICO,Mine.
39_ALIC,I don't think Darren put anything on it.
39_NICO,Mhm.
39_ALIC,Right. Okay.
39_KIRS,Why don't you have a seat.
39_NICO,Sure...
39_LORI,Oh I'm tired.
39_KIRS,"So, they went to Wiencke Island, where a lot of seals are from, and."
39_LORI,Mhm...
39_AMY,<XX>...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,<XX>.
39_KIRS,Collected eggs.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"Okay, so, the process was, I'm just gonna finish up on my story, the process was, was they, um, they went to the nest, okay from our staff, it was Mark Ryan from marine mammals, and Mike Mulligan from fishes, and, frankly I- I'm not quite sure who the entourage of other people were. But, they went to the nest, and basically, waited for the penguin to stand up, and checked to see if there were two eggs there."
39_AMY,Hm.
39_KIRS,"Gentu penguins, and this isn-... isn't true of all penguins, often, when a penguin lays eggs, if it lays two, one is smaller than the other. Gentus lay two equally sized eggs. Okay, um."
39_LORI,Hm.
39_KIRS,"The reason I mentioned that was, if one was smaller, he would have went for the smaller egg. Okay."
39_DON,Why.
39_KIRS,Because that would probably mean that.
39_LORI,Female.
39_KIRS,"Do you remember reading, in the exhibit for the Rockhopper penguins, downstairs, they lay two different sized eggs."
39_DON,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"Depending on the year, and depending on the conditions of light, um, if it's a bad year, or there's just not a lot of food resources, um, environmental conditions are rough, it's a stormy bad year."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"A penguin might lay two eggs, and at that point, I don't. I don't really wanna use the word decide."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"That's kind of anthropomorphic, but, somehow figure out, at this point I'm gonna kick out an egg."
39_LORI,Determine.
39_DON,Ah.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"I'm going to determine, through whatever."
39_AMY,Mm.
39_KIRS,However it does determine to do so.
39_NICO,Hm.
39_KIRS,Will kick out an egg...
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Otherwise, it will brood the two eggs, and hatch em out. It's not uncommon that, at this point, they'll kick out the smaller chick."
39_DON,Right.
39_KIRS,"If at that point conditions don't seem to be sufficient to support raising two of em, it's kind of like, hey, why bother."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"And kick out, one of. One of the chicks. If it's a great year, on fat, there's food, di- it's a beautiful day."
39_DON,It's called penguin euthanasia...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Okay...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"They'll they'll, they'll try to raise both..."
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,So...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,I didn't catch that. What wa-.
39_DON,It's called penguin euthanasia.
39_KIRS,Sh...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Ch, Yeah..."
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Um, so, anyway. Apparently what th- what they. Now at this point they wanted to see, okay, now, is there actually a fertile. Is there a fertile chick, or developing chick inside."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"And, apparently it was very very muddy, it was abnormally warm, and it was just a big mudbath out there, and they couldn't. They couldn't clean off the mud enough, to be able to see inside. To see if, if it was viable. So, they took an egg from nests, that had two eggs. And I think this this report says, within thirty-one hours, the eggs were back here in Chicago."
39_LORI,Wow.
39_KIRS,That's pretty neat.
39_NICO,Oh.
39_KIRS,"And then, they took them to an off-site incubation area, in Addison. Is anybody from Addison. I don't know where Addison is."
39_NICO,I don't either s-.
39_X,It's a west suburb.
39_KIRS,West.
39_AMY,Yes.
39_KIRS,So they were out in the west suburbs. And incubated there...
39_X,<NONVERBAL>
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,Mm...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"A nd, apparently now they're about, six to seven weeks old."
39_NICO,Wow.
39_AMY,"When I was here two weeks ago, they were sixty days."
39_KIRS,T- s- two weeks ago it was sixty days.
39_AMY,"I think, maybe it was four weeks ago."
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_AMY,Yeah.
39_KIRS,"I think, I think they're around six weeks old."
39_LORI,Mm.
39_KIRS,"Okay. But when you see them, you'll see that they're just about as big as number ten. They're big."
39_LORI,N-kay.
39_AMY,"Yeah. When I. Yeah, when I was here they had, they were losing all of their hair. And they looked, the two oldest ones looked like Ten."
39_KIRS,"Right. Right. So basically, what the process has been is, we brought them here as chicks, but they still had their downy feathers. Okay, so, as they lost their downy feathers, they became eligible to go out onto exhibit. And so what they did last time you guys were here, there was maybe ten. That were, you know, I say eligible, to be out on exhibit..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"And what they would do is, they would carry them in, let them hang out for about a half an hour, get acclimated to what was going on, and then take them off. And do this. Now they're out. Now they're, they are out on exhibit."
39_DON,All of them.
39_KIRS,Uh Almost all of em. Two days ago there was twenty-five out on exhibit. So we have thirty chicks total.
39_DON,Right.
39_LORI,Hm.
39_KIRS,"So, twenty-five plus are out on exhibit."
39_DON,Okay.
39_KIRS,"Um, thing of it is, is let's think a little bit about penguin natural history. Okay. How, how long do penguins spend on land."
39_DON,Three months I think.
39_KIRS,What's your guess.
39_LORI,Uh.
39_DON,"Three or is it, three to six months."
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_LORI,"Um, four. Five."
39_KIRS,Six.
39_DON,Six.
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_NICO,Six months.
39_KIRS,"So, it's it's basically."
39_NICO,Wow.
39_KIRS,It's an even even split...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Between, life out at sea and life on land. So the sequence of events is, they come on to shore, springtime, they hook up with their mate, they build a nest, they mate, they lay their eggs, they brood their eggs, they hatch their chicks, they brood their chicks, they feed their chicks, they molt, and then they're out to sea. So all of that has to happen, within that six-month period, that's a pretty busy bird..."
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,So...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"The penguins need to grow, the chicks, in order to be ready, to go out there, for six months out at sea, really need to be very well suited for that..."
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"So they nee- need to be big, they need to be hefty, they need to have their adult feathers, so."
39_AMY,Mm.
39_KIRS,"Between the time that they actually hatch out, and the time that they're ready to go out to sea, is just a couple of months."
39_NICO,How long does it take for them to hatch.
39_KIRS,Well the incubation period.
39_NICO,"Or um, to have experience."
39_KIRS,"Is anywhere, depends on the species, it's it's one month to two months."
39_NICO,Oh okay.
39_KIRS,"Okay, so, therefore, you know basically, between building a nest, and mating, and all of that other stuff, you know they, I would say that they have three months, to- to grow and get ready. Okay. So they're big. Now the funny thing is, is that, according to Mark Ryan, well, hmm..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Or just interesting. I guess, Go watch them, um."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"If you watch the trainers, they walk into the exhibit, and they start throwing penguins into the water. And pushing them in, and they're all over the place, um..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"They try to get out, sometimes they make it, sometimes they fall back in, Gentus usually dive in head first, these guys are falling in..."
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Jumping in, diving in, so their behaviors if you will are, are really interesting. Okay."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"It's just, it's just a lot of fun to watch them. Um, they're doing something different with these chicks than we've done with the other penguins, is that they're trying to feed them crill. Um, yesterday I think is th- is th- is when they tried it for the first time, and that crill, is about as big as."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"You know from my joint, up to the top of my finger here, so it's very difficult for a person to hold a crill..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"And drop it into a penguin's mouth. So, very good f- s- food source for them, that's what they would feed on in the wild, in addition to other things, so, what they're trying to do is, they're throwing the crill into the water, and seeing if the chicks'll go for it. So they tried it yesterday, and they had some mixed success, you know some animals were interested, others weren't. So, y- a- apparently they- they'll keep doing this. So. Did. Were they weren't doing that when you were in there."
39_AMY,No. No no no.
39_KIRS,"Okay. When they were chicks, cause what is it. How does a mother feed a penguin chick."
39_LORI,Doesn't she bring food to it.
39_AMY,She regurgitates it.
39_KIRS,She regurgitates it.
39_LORI,Oh.
39_KIRS,"I sh- shouldn't say she, cause mother and father share."
39_LORI,Both.
39_NICO,Oh.
39_KIRS,"Share the duties, okay. But yeah, they go out, they feed, and they regurgitate up the food, and that's how they feed the chicks."
39_NICO,Mm.
39_LORI,Actually other birds do that as well.
39_KIRS,A lot.
39_AMY,Mhm.
39_LORI,"Don't they, a lot of birds do."
39_AMY,Yeah.
39_KIRS,Yeah. A lot of birds do.
39_LORI,That's right...
39_KIRS,"They never really did any, well, we h- didn't regurgitate for them, but..."
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"They started them off with um strips of fish, and they actually dipped it in a vitamin and um pureed crill batter."
39_LORI,Mm...
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Dipped it in, and then gave it to the penguin chicks. So they've been on solid food."
39_LORI,Hm.
39_KIRS,"For quite some time, and now it's just interesting to see if they'll just go for the crill itself."
39_AMY,"Are they, I mean, are they being hesitant about it."
39_KIRS,I didn't see it. Yesterday was the first time.
39_AMY,Because.
39_KIRS,They did it at eleven thirty and four o'clock. Where the.
39_AMY,"That's really interesting, because, I mean, going from being hand-fed."
39_KIRS,"Right. Right. So I don't know. So I would say, if you've got the time, or if you wanna make the time to be down there at four thirty, hopefully they'll do it again today, and it'll be interesting to see, so. I'll find out from Mark. Um, you know what the response with that is."
39_LORI,So four thirty's chick feeding.
39_KIRS,Yes.
39_DON,"Are there any particular trainers working with the penguins, uh, hm. Are all the trainers allowed to work with the penguins."
39_KIRS,"Yeah. Well basically here, um, all of the trainers work with all of the animals. So, they rotate them around, basically, Excuse me. So that the animals don't get attached to one person. Because if that person decides to leave, then, that could be detrimental to the animals. But, we do have a lead, a lead person for each animal..."
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Mark Ryan is lead penguins.
39_DON,Mhm.
39_KIRS,Meg is lead otter. Lisa Takaki was lead lag...
39_DON,<XX>.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"Greg is lead seal. So, Mark is basically calling the shots, for how the program's gonna be structured. So he's, he's the penguin trivia guy. So, it's a neat story."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"It's it's a very neat background story, and, I think, you know, for s- for some of us, underwater viewing gallery has not been your favorite place, so, this could, uh uh this could bring new light to the underwater viewing gallery."
39_LORI,Could be a gift.
39_KIRS,"And actually, just give a new focus on the penguins. We haven't done as much interpretation with the penguins, as we do with the other animals, so, you actually have some kinda neat things to interpret here. As far as what's going on. Some other things that you might see, the penguins segregate themselves. The species don't intermix. Okay, if you've noticed that before."
39_NICO,Mm.
39_KIRS,"The Rockhoppers pretty much station themselves in the center, the Magellanics used to be off to the right..."
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"And then, well number ten, could do whatever she wanted..."
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_DON,The Gentu.
39_KIRS,But.
39_NICO,What's number ten. I k-.
39_KIRS,I'm sorry.
39_NICO,I I k- s-...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,I k- I keep going.
39_KIRS,Number ten.
39_NICO,What's number ten here...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Kay, the the penguins are numbered."
39_NICO,Oh okay.
39_KIRS,Each penguin is numbered...
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"And on, on the arm."
39_LORI,Wing...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Okay, the the joint here, well, what do you call this."
39_DON,The wing. Humerus. Hm.
39_KIRS,At the humerus.
39_DON,Hu-.
39_KIRS,We would have a tag.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"And they're color-coded, so, if you were like to see, well how does it work. Give me a number."
39_AMY,Well they wear colors. When I was there.
39_KIRS,Okay. They're colors but.
39_AMY,Just seven. Did they move em to numbers...
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
39_AMY,They were going to.
39_KIRS,"What it is is that, green, let's say for example, green stands for one, black stands for two. That's number twelve."
39_AMY,Is that how it works.
39_KIRS,Yeah.
39_AMY,Okay.
39_KIRS,"So, they number them, so that, when they're feeding them, and they're taking down the records of, okay number twelve ate five Columbia River smelts, and two..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Capelands.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"They can keep a record of what the animal eats. Okay, so they don't have names, but, she, because sh-. Because she's the lone feisty penguin, number ten has become kind of famous, in the penguin world downstairs. So, it it it's a female..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Th- the only female Gentu penguin, that we had prior to the chicks coming in."
39_NICO,Okay.
39_KIRS,"Okay, so, um, now you'll see that they're segregated, actually the Gentus have kind of broken up into clumps, and there's. From what I saw yesterday, three different clumps, um, let's see. Let's. G-. Let's interpret some of the behaviors we might see. Okay, what is, what is a penguin standing out with its arms like this. I shouldn't say arms. Its..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,Wings...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_DON,Wings.
39_KIRS,Its wings.
39_NICO,Wings...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Right.
39_LORI,Um.
39_DON,Perspiring.
39_LORI,Actually cooling off.
39_DON,Cooling off.
39_LORI,Isn't it.
39_KIRS,Yeah. Yeah.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"So right here, is where you don't, where the penguins don't have a a dense covering of feathers. So if they wanna cool off, they tend to do this. Okay if I was to see a penguin doing this, lifting one leg up."
39_LORI,It's resting. Isn't it.
39_KIRS,What else could it be.
39_AMY,Sleeping. No.
39_NICO,Balance. I guess.
39_KIRS,It's balancing...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,It's doing thinking tricks...
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Um...
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"Actually, it would be conserving heat. Okay."
39_NICO,Oh.
39_DON,Hm.
39_KIRS,"So, the wings, and the f- legs, feet."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"There's no dense feather coverage on the, on the legs, so they might be conserving heat. Okay, um, if, I saw a penguin, sneezing..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,What might be happening there.
39_NICO,Allergic. To food...
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
39_AMY,Sick.
39_DON,I've never heard a penguin sneezing but...
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,Cold...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Okay...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,It actually kind of sneezes.
39_NICO,"I know, could you hear it..."
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,"How can you tell from it, like shaking his head."
39_KIRS,You'll.
39_NICO,Or sneezing.
39_KIRS,"You'll see him. You'll see him, just like what a person sneezing."
39_NICO,"Oh, okay."
39_KIRS,You can tell.
39_DON,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"When they jerk their head like that. How was, how does a penguin get its fresh water. How does a penguin drink."
39_NICO,Oh.
39_LORI,"I haven't studied penguins in a while. Don, do you know."
39_DON,No.
39_LORI,Hm-mm.
39_DON,From. I thought a way w-. Drank from pools. Just.
39_KIRS,They'll drink salt water.
39_DON,Salt water.
39_KIRS,"All- uh also, you know, like the dolphins, they actually metabolize the water, that's stored in in the fat of the fish that they eat. And that's how they get their water source."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"But basically, you've gotta separate, the fresh water from the salt water, actually just have to separate out that salt. So they have a special s-."
39_NICO,They have to do that.
39_LORI,So that's how they're do-.
39_NICO,Oh.
39_LORI,"That's what they're doing when they sneeze, is they're getting rid of the salt."
39_KIRS,Salt.
39_NICO,Oh.
39_KIRS,That they have accumulated. They have a salt gland. In the beak. And that is what separates the salt out.
39_DON,Did you know that before.
39_KIRS,And to get rid of that salt they.
39_LORI,Hm-mm.
39_DON,Me neither...
39_KIRS,they sneeze.
39_LORI,Yeah actually.
39_NICO,"Oh, I never even thought of that."
39_LORI,"I remember doing the penguin thing a year ago, but I don't remember that adaptation."
39_DON,No.
39_LORI,Oh well.
39_KIRS,"Um, we're gonna have to go up and do Q and A, in three minutes... Just looking at the clock."
39_LORI,Who's do-.
39_KIRS,I'm facing the clock.
39_LORI,Who's the diver.
39_KIRS,"I don't. Oh, probably Bernie. Um."
39_NICO,"Do they have different divers, every."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_NICO,Time.
39_KIRS,"Yeah, every day. Every day."
39_NICO,Oh.
39_KIRS,"So that would be excreting salt. Um, when I see a penguin picking its butt. What is it doing..."
39_NICO,<NONVERBAL>
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,"Preening. Kinda like, picking at its feathers."
39_DON,Preening. Preening.
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_LORI,Preening.
39_KIRS,"It's preening, what is it doing. What's at the base of the tail."
39_DON,Uh.
39_KIRS,This is fun you guys.
39_DON,"Yeah, right..."
39_AMY,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,It's at the.
39_NICO,It is fun...
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,What's at the base of the tail.
39_NICO,I wouldn't've even thought of these things.
39_DON,Well the anus is at the end of the tail.
39_NICO,"It's like, oh, didn't know they had meaning."
39_KIRS,Pardon me.
39_DON,Right. The anus is at the end of the tail.
39_KIRS,"That is, that is very true."
39_DON,Right.
39_KIRS,But.
39_DON,But.
39_KIRS,Let's say near the anus. What might be there.
39_DON,Why don't you answer this question.
39_LORI,I got preening...
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_NICO,Ah.
39_KIRS,It's okay.
39_LORI,It's.
39_KIRS,It's the preening gland.
39_DON,Yeah.
39_LORI,"Oh, okay."
39_KIRS,"Okay, so it's a gland, that stores oil, so what a penguin will do, is it'll go back, it'll squeeze the gland..."
39_DON,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,"It'll get some oil on its beak, and then, it's rubbing that waterproofing."
39_LORI,"So it can keep itself waterproof, right."
39_DON,Mm.
39_KIRS,Waterproofing.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_NICO,Oh.
39_KIRS,All over its feathers.
39_AMY,Hm.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"Preening, also consists of, working an air layer, at the base of the feathers, because air is a better insulator than water. If there was water touching the skin."
39_LORI,Hm.
39_KIRS,Water is like a vacuum cleaner. It is just gonna suck the heat away.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"So by having the air there, it's a better insulator. So when I see a penguin dive into the water, and I see all of these little air bubbles coming out, what am I seeing."
39_LORI,The air is r-. Is.
39_DON,Escaping from the feathers.
39_LORI,Escaping. Right.
39_KIRS,Is compressed out.
39_LORI,From the...
39_KIRS,"so the penguin comes up on land, and let's start again."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"And will start preening, working that air layer in, getting some oil..."
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Spreading it out.
39_LORI,How often do the.
39_DON,Mm.
39_LORI,How d- often does the bird molt...
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
39_LORI,Once a year.
39_KIRS,Once a year.
39_LORI,Okay.
39_KIRS,Some species'll molt twice.
39_LORI,Uhuh Twice.
39_KIRS,"But basically, if you think about it, you know, a year, of picking at the feathers, the feathers are gonna wear out."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"So the last thing that a penguin does, before it goes out to sea, is."
39_LORI,"Shed its, yeah."
39_NICO,Okay.
39_KIRS,It does a clean sweep.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"And, molts all of its feathers off. And then gets the new feathers on. Okay. So, other than that, um, really the only training. That they do with the penguins. You know, we train all kinds of behaviors, with the other animals. The- the- the- the training that they do with the penguins, is basically, that they have feeding stations for them."
39_DON,Hm.
39_KIRS,"Uh Rockhoppers' is here, uh Gentus' is here, Magellanics' is here, and you are not gonna get a fish, unless you come to your feeding station."
39_LORI,Do they pretty much know that by now. Have they pretty much adapted to that.
39_AMY,They were still in the room.
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_AMY,"When, when I was here. And, they were, they were pretty random about it, because Mark would take, you know a bucket over here."
39_KIRS,Right. And that was with the chicks.
39_AMY,"And then, whoever, yeah."
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_AMY,"With the, yeah, I mean, the ones that were in there."
39_LORI,The adult penguins.
39_AMY,"They, yeah, the adult ones were fine about it."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_AMY,"You know, someone set up over here, and someone over here, and they pretty much went, where they were supposed to."
39_LORI,"So they knew, to go to station one."
39_AMY,Yeah.
39_LORI,Versus station two.
39_KIRS,Right.
39_AMY,Yeah.
39_LORI,Okay.
39_KIRS,"So, I guess... Not I'm not. I'm not sure, but, it's just kind of interesting, because, other facilities, as far as I'm aware, it's like with the sea otters as well, you know, uh the training that they do with these animals is pretty minimal. With the sea otters, they're pretty. They can be aggressive, they have big teeth. People have historically done more training, with cetaceans, than they have with other animals, and we, we really do some pretty unique training here, with our penguins, with our sea otters, and with our seals."
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,So. It's kinda neat stuff.
39_LORI,Cool.
39_KIRS,"Anything else. About penguins, that we should discuss. For you guys, the key to the penguin cart, if you d-. Well, I don't."
39_LORI,The puffin cart.
39_KIRS,"Uh, Are. Yeah the."
39_DON,Puffin cart.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"Is on, is behind the tide pool. On one of re- the reserve tanks. So if you choose to pick a specimen, you don't have to bring the whole cart out. If you wanna grab a specimen."
39_DON,Hm.
39_KIRS,"And bring it out to the exhibit, that's fine. But, I suggest that you check it out today, anyway, um, there's just. There's some neat things to interpret. So. Check it out."
39_LORI,You've got underwater viewing.
39_DON,Yeah. At three.
39_KIRS,"Check it out. So if there's a time, you know for Lori to go do it."
39_LORI,"Well I'll probably go between coastal, I'll probably meander coastal downstairs."
39_KIRS,Okay.
39_LORI,Cause there's a presentation close to four thirty.
39_KIRS,Okay. Great.
39_LORI,Oh wait. Never mind. I'll do it then. When there's a presentation at three.
39_KIRS,Perfect.
39_LORI,Mhm.
39_KIRS,"So that is penguin stuff. Um, I hate to say it, but, can you guys go do Q and A, or who. Or Lori are you doing Q and A."
39_LORI,"No, I don't think anyone signed up for Q and A."
39_DON,Nobody signed up for Q and A...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,Nobody's gonna do Q and A...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,I should've cancelled it then. Guys why won't somebody do Q and A.
39_LORI,"Well, both of us."
39_KIRS,Do it together.
39_DON,You wanna do it.
39_LORI,"Yeah, cause I can't remember the questions."
39_KIRS,Do it together.
39_LORI,You have to remind me the question.
39_DON,I gotta be down at the tide pool at two thirty.
39_LORI,Alright. That's okay.
39_KIRS,Okay. Okay.
39_LORI,We'll do Q and A. And if it's.
39_KIRS,Thanks guys.
39_LORI,"Uh what time is Q and A, two twenty."
39_KIRS,Now.
39_LORI,And.
39_DON,Right now.
39_LORI,Tell me when I can get checked out on seals.
39_DON,Two fifteen.
39_KIRS,Okay. I'll find you.
39_LORI,Today.
39_DON,Where's the um.
39_KIRS,I will find you.
39_LORI,"I don't wanna do it in two weeks, I'll forget."
39_DON,Where's the...
39_LORI,<NONVERBAL>
39_KIRS,<NONVERBAL>
