29_SETH,Excuse me...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,"Hey, how are you guy."
29_SETH,Are you Larry. Are you Larry.
29_LARR,Yes. How are you.
29_SETH,Are you. You're the guy.
29_LARR,Hunh.
29_SETH,You're the guy to talk to then.
29_LARR,I'm the guy. Yeah...
29_SETH,I didn't know if I had the right place.
29_LARR,"Yeah, you got it. I just."
29_SETH,What are you doing there.
29_LARR,"You're probably trying t-. Yeah this is strange, what's this guy doing..."
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,"I'm putting water in a twenty-six gallon container, inside my truck..."
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Wow. That's quite a p-.
29_LARR,"Cause I had to haul it to a property, which doesn't have any water, and I have to spray the road."
29_SETH,Ah...
29_LARR,Cause the road before you can drive on it.
29_SETH,Interesting.
29_LARR,"It needs more uh... more stability. Evidently. So give me one second to lock this thing, and then <XX>."
29_SETH,"Is that to keep the dust, keep the dust down."
29_LARR,"Well, no, it's not that so much, it's uh..."
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,"They put, they put a uh, a type of uh base on it that needs water and..."
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,That just hasn't happened yet.
29_SETH,Oh...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,I see. So there's some chemical reaction that has to take place.
29_LARR,Yeah. I guess a good a- analogy...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,"Chelsea, no..."
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,That should hold it in there. Okay. Nice to meet you.
29_SETH,How you doing. Good to see you.
29_LARR,What's your name...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Seth.
29_LARR,Seth. Okay.
29_SETH,Here's my card here.
29_LARR,Thanks Seth...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,I think it's warming up a bit here.
29_SETH,Is this the house we're looking at.
29_LARR,I'll take you down in the basement.
29_SETH,Is the furnace down in the basement.
29_LARR,"What's left of it, yeah..."
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,We had all these.
29_SETH,Is it a old system.
29_LARR,"Yeah. We had the asbestos uh all removed from it and, and uh."
29_SETH,Oh really.
29_LARR,So that's been done.
29_SETH,I was j-. I was just at a place that does asbestos removal.
29_LARR,"Yeah, where."
29_SETH,Cal. Cal Tech.
29_LARR,They're the guys that did it.
29_SETH,Are they. Alright.
29_LARR,Yeah...
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,"That's down in Berkeley, right."
29_SETH,No they're... they've got an office here in Nappa.
29_LARR,Cal Tech. What was the. No. Synergy. That's who.
29_SETH,Synergy. Dif- different one.
29_LARR,I I'm sorry. It's a different outfit. I didn't know they had one up here.
29_SETH,Yeah. Though I think they had just recently moved here.
29_LARR,Unhunh.
29_SETH,Cause I was wondering t-.
29_LARR,"So where's the man with the uh camera, and the."
29_SETH,Oh I got the. I got my recorder right here...
29_LARR,That's pretty clever.
29_SETH,"Yeah, my brother is uh, teaches linguistics, and I guess he's doing this study."
29_LARR,"Oh, okay."
29_SETH,And they just want business conversations.
29_LARR,Alright. Well.
29_SETH,Wow.
29_LARR,Here's the animal.
29_SETH,My gosh...
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Wow.
29_LARR,They took uh some of it with em obviously.
29_SETH,Did this used to be... used to be an old oil.
29_LARR,Yeah. I think it was an old.
29_SETH,Fire.
29_LARR,"I think it was an old, see the oil tank here. Isn't that an oil tank."
29_SETH,Yeah.
29_LARR,That's what my guess is. And uh...
29_X,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Wow.
29_LARR,Do you have a flashlight on you.
29_SETH,Sure do.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"So, then you get duct work. Or is this the flue."
29_LARR,"Well, yeah. What they did."
29_SETH,That's the flue I guess.
29_LARR,"They they took the stubs, and they cleaned em up. So you can tie right into em. See."
29_SETH,Yeah. So this used to have asbestos. Hunh.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,Where did all this connect. Was there a a plenum on top of here.
29_LARR,"So, Yeah. There was a big hood that went over the top of this thing, with these stack that went this way."
29_SETH,Okay. Yeah like an octopus type.
29_LARR,"And then one that goes back, un- underneath there to the... to the uh kitchen, there are- there are different... there are different ones, that kinda go all the way up."
29_SETH,"I see one r-, there's a rectangular one right there."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"Is that one right there, w- that I'm flashing my light on."
29_LARR,"Yeah, it might be. It kinda looks like it. And then there was... there's one farther up, and then there is this one here."
29_SETH,"So you have one two three, at least two there."
29_LARR,"Three, and then there's another one way down. I don't know if you can see it or not, but it's... it's up into the kitchen."
29_SETH,So there's probably three back there... and a-... and any over on this side.
29_LARR,"Well, no but, what- what we... we want to p- you to kinda give us an idea, on a- w- what your thoughts are."
29_SETH,You wanna add a c-... add a few more.
29_LARR,"Add a couple. Yeah. Back, ee way back there. Is that one way back. Can't see it..."
29_SETH,<XX> get this thing.
29_LARR,To help.
29_SETH,To a point.
29_LARR,"I don't know what this was, looks like they."
29_SETH,That was connected to one of em.
29_LARR,Yeah. They left that here.
29_SETH,"I don't see any back in here, but."
29_LARR,"Well there's there's definitely one back there. Now there's nothing out here, and this is where we feel we we should add one. Is, this is a, gonna be a dining room."
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,"So, uh, one for-... one there for sure."
29_SETH,"What about, uh, what about above this section of the house."
29_LARR,"Well, let me show you that. And you can give... you can give me some idea about that as well."
29_SETH,"Now uh, you are on propane... out here."
29_LARR,No. This is natural gas.
29_SETH,Oh really.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,Oh good.
29_LARR,Kinda rare.
29_SETH,"That's good, because uh, the problem with propane is that, they wouldn't be able to v-... the co-... the county would probably have a problem with it."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"Cause they're very concerned about propane. But natural gas, I can put a."
29_LARR,Yeah... we were real happy to get this place with natural gas.
29_SETH,Do you want me to remove the old furnace...
29_LARR,We'll not have to.
29_SETH,"No uh, do you want me to remove it."
29_LARR,Oh yes.
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,Yeah...
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,No that's... that would be part of our deal. Yeah.
29_SETH,Well y- the new furnace w- would be much smaller. That much I can guarantee you.
29_LARR,Alright.
29_SETH,Do you-...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,How many square feet is the house.
29_LARR,"Uh, well I guess it's around twenty-eight. Approximately."
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,"I have a roof guy coming about this time too, so."
29_SETH,You're doing the roof.
29_LARR,"Doorbell rings, we know who it is."
29_SETH,Getting a new roof put on too...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,"Well I got some problems with leakage in certain areas, and just gotta get it fixed, before we get the rain again. Alright, well let's start in the kitchen. Okay this is... this is one right here. See, I don't think you saw this one, but."
29_SETH,"I'm wondering if, you don't have a floor plan of the house, do you by any chance."
29_LARR,No. We don't...
29_SETH,<XX>...
29_LARR,We didn't get anything when we bought this baby.
29_SETH,I'm wondering if I should just sketch it out.
29_LARR,Uh.
29_SETH,"It's two-story though, right."
29_LARR,Two-story.
29_SETH,Th-. Are there any registers on the second floor.
29_LARR,Unhunh.
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,"So all those st-... all those stubs that were behind us, are the ones that go up through the wall."
29_SETH,Oh. Okay...
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Well that's no problem.
29_LARR,Uh.
29_SETH,As long as I don't have to do any ducting to the second floor.
29_LARR,Yeah. No. They only... the only thing that we wanted you to do is tie into the existing ones.
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,Which are on the ground level.
29_SETH,How about that one right there. Is that one.
29_LARR,"Uh, yeah. That's one as well. And then the return is back here."
29_SETH,Okay. Good sized return.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,Now you're not looking at uh adding air conditioning. Right.
29_LARR,"Well, we would like to have that as an option..."
29_SETH,"<XX>, Okay."
29_LARR,We could always add that later. Right.
29_SETH,"Yeah. One of the things you can do, if if you don't wanna do it now, you can, what they call, prep for air conditioning. You can put in the coil. See you've got the furnace and the coil."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"And then, when you add air conditioning in the future, all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit, and refrigerant piping to that coil. So it saves... it saves additional work in the future."
29_LARR,Mhm.
29_SETH,"Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in, which means you gotta modify the duct work, to get that coil in there so."
29_LARR,Right.
29_SETH,"If you're thinking about doing it in the future, you might wanna at least put the coil in. It only costs about three-hundred fifty dollars for the coil."
29_LARR,Oh. Alright.
29_SETH,It's the it's the outdoor air conditioning that.
29_LARR,"Well, write that in there, anyway in the in the quote."
29_SETH,And now that's the the dining room you wanna add.
29_LARR,Yeah. If you... if you go over and have a look at the dining room.
29_SETH,You got a lotta glass in that room it looks like.
29_LARR,"Yeah, and uh we're gonna be making changes to the to the house too, so we're keeping that in mind. But if you notice, there are no registers in here. So."
29_SETH,Is this accessible.
29_LARR,Oh yeah.
29_SETH,"I wonder. I wonder if, was this added on you think..."
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Maybe. I'm just wondering if that foundation wall.
29_LARR,M-. It might've been.
29_SETH,"Goes to that, I wonder if I can get into this."
29_LARR,Oh you can get into it. Yeah.
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,Oh yeah. I've been under here.
29_SETH,Oh okay. Good.
29_LARR,"So, this is not a problem."
29_SETH,Shoot I'd probably go with two registers in this room...
29_LARR,<XX>. Alright... <XX>.
29_SETH,I'd probably go like one here.
29_LARR,Oh yeah.
29_SETH,And one one there.
29_LARR,You'd do one over there as well.
29_SETH,Cause it's a good-sized room with a lot of glass.
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,"Or you could do it, you know, you could put like one on this wall, and one on that wall."
29_LARR,"Okay, on the two two outside-."
29_SETH,And then I'd probably tie em both together.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"Into one Y-branch, you know like the room."
29_LARR,Mhm.
29_SETH,"The room is shaped somewhat like this. I could put like one there, one there."
29_LARR,"Now what we'd want you to do, in this case, is maybe."
29_SETH,Tie those together like that.
29_LARR,"See this this. The end of this room might be modified. So, all we wanna know is, is that we can eventually be able to do this. Alright. To to get uh get this duct work done, when we do... when we do the modification to the."
29_SETH,"Oh, so you may not do the duct work at this point."
29_LARR,Not not in this room...
29_SETH,<XX> <XX> do it in the future.
29_LARR,We m-. Yeah. Uh I I hate to see us do it.
29_SETH,Where are gonna be your.
29_LARR,Although if we do it in the sidewalls.
29_SETH,Well what would the modification be.
29_LARR,"Oh we might take this out, and we might push this out further, and, uh, well, here's the drawings, right here. Uh, let's see, that's the guest house. Where is that sucker."
29_SETH,Dining room.
29_LARR,"Yeah. Yeah, I. It's right... i-... here it i- here it i- here it is right here."
29_SETH,Is this the wall.
29_LARR,You can see that... this is the current wall.
29_SETH,"Oh okay, so are you gonna go out like three feet or so."
29_LARR,So we might... we might... we might uh do a little modification.
29_SETH,A tape- tapered uh corners.
29_LARR,A tapered corner there. So we might do a little of that.
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,"But, if you're gonna put it in h- this end wall, then, maybe it wouldn't be affected. That one might down there. Because, we might uh."
29_SETH,Yeah...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,See well.
29_LARR,See eventually we have s-.
29_SETH,"You know you're right. Cause I... cause we're looking at right there, course, now you gonna go out."
29_LARR,That's right. See we're opening this.
29_SETH,That's gonna go that way.
29_LARR,"That... it's... that that that's going out to this master, which is gonna go up on the hill."
29_SETH,"Aw, so you'll need. What about heating for that."
29_LARR,"Well, what we're gonna do is put uh radiated heat."
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,In- in there.
29_SETH,That'll be a slab floor then.
29_LARR,"For sure. Yeah, yeah. Uh."
29_SETH,So that one might change.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,Uh.
29_LARR,"I- that's a that's a good point. I've I I'm not uh, we were th-."
29_SETH,"The only thing is, I don't know how long, is that gonna be like in the future, like a year down the road."
29_LARR,Yeah. Probably.
29_SETH,"Cause it would be nice to have heat in here in the meantime. I mean say you do the furnace, It would be nice to have it for this winter."
29_LARR,Well let me work that out with my wife. Put that as a.
29_SETH,"But one thing you can do, even if you do a modification, you can move the register. I mean say we put the register right here, and that's gonna b-... uh that would obviously have to be moved, you know, it's not a big deal to move it from here to here."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"You might have to add a piece of duct work, but it's not gonna be a major change."
29_LARR,Okay. Okay.
29_SETH,And this one you may not have to move at all. That may be okay.
29_LARR,Alright.
29_SETH,"But then that's probably how I'd do it, some- something like that, or, if I had the registers going that way, that might be the best way to do it. It'd be like for- fourteen by six..."
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,"I mean that would probably be an eight-inch duct, that'd be an eight-inch, that'd be a ten-inch, and then the furnace, I don't know, it's somewhere over there in that area."
29_LARR,Furnace is.
29_SETH,I'm not sure how many feet.
29_LARR,"Well the furnace sits down, over in this, this corner over here. That's where the furnace is."
29_SETH,One. Two.
29_LARR,Probably right in here.
29_SETH,Three.
29_LARR,And now. That's probably what-... that's one of the.
29_SETH,That's about thirty.
29_LARR,"Key, my key concerns."
29_SETH,About thirty-six feet across.
29_LARR,"Is th- is the how noisy the furnace is. That's a real concern to me. And uh, I don't know what they've got these days, if they're all... uh I know there's pulse type furnaces, which evidently are kinda loud or something."
29_SETH,Oh yeah. Yeah. Lennox pulse...
29_LARR,Oh really.
29_SETH,That's a loud one.
29_LARR,Is it.
29_SETH,Yeah.
29_LARR,Really.
29_SETH,"I've put a few of those in, and they."
29_LARR,Have you.
29_SETH,I've had problems. I wouldn't go with the Lennox pulse.
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,If I go with a uh.
29_LARR,Well.
29_SETH,I'd probably go with the Carrier. Carrier furnace. The return grill's plenty big enough.
29_LARR,Yeah. It's a big return.
29_SETH,I mean I can't... you can't have any kind of problem there.
29_LARR,"And a... and and the pipes are big enough, so, and that's normally when you get... you get a lot of noise in the house. Is if your... if your uh ducts are too small. Right."
29_SETH,"Right. Yeah, y- the two main sources of noise, are either, uh, air noise, which is due to undersized grills."
29_LARR,Really.
29_SETH,You got air rushing through there at high velocity. The other source of noise is th- is the fan motor itself...
29_LARR,In the- in the actual.
29_SETH,In the unit itself.
29_LARR,Unhunh.
29_SETH,"And that's usually solved by b-, just having flexible duct between the unit and the d- and the registers, so that it dampens out the noise. In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall, it would be noisy."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"But we're going d-. I'm not sure how it connects, did we see that down there. I'll have to go down and take a look at that again but."
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,"I imagine it goes down, and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit. As long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit, then I."
29_LARR,You can.
29_SETH,Then I can uh eliminate th- the noise problem.
29_LARR,Alright.
29_SETH,"So it's basically thirty by thirty, return air. Thirty by thirty return air."
29_LARR,"And this is a uh, this is the only return, and I'd. I would say not."
29_SETH,Oh this is return also.
29_LARR,"Not placed, not placed very well, in the room."
29_SETH,This is.
29_LARR,So.
29_SETH,This is supply though. Right.
29_LARR,This is the supply. Right.
29_SETH,Okay. Yeah.
29_LARR,"See, and I'd. Where would you suggest they would go. If uh, if we put uh."
29_SETH,"Boy. I would say g-, I'd probably go with two. I'd put one on each side, I'd probably put one like right underneath that window there, and maybe underneath that window. Be nice to put it behind the couch, but then you've... it would be blocked off too much."
29_LARR,"And you thi-... you so you you p- you try and put em under windows, where that's where your."
29_SETH,Yeah. I try to put em on the cold-...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,Basically the coldest part of the room.
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,"Because uh, it just helps, y because otherwise, you know, with a grill right here, you end up having cold spots on the sides."
29_LARR,Mhm.
29_SETH,"Cause what happens is, the air goes back to the return grill, so it never really."
29_LARR,It wouldn't get out circulating through.
29_SETH,It never really blows out to the corners.
29_LARR,Right.
29_SETH,"So that's why I try to put it as far away on the perimeter, and have it pull across the room."
29_LARR,Okay... well this is the only.
29_SETH,So I don't know if you'd wanna.
29_LARR,"Uh the only the only other addition room, where we thought maybe registers would be important. And I'd, I don't know if, uh, floor registers. Are there... are- th- i- i- i- is- d- does it... that's not a good idea these days."
29_SETH,"No, I would go with floor registers in this house, cause you got high ceilings."
29_LARR,Uh <XX>.
29_SETH,"Well in fact, you wouldn't be able to put any kind of ceiling register in. Cause you get the second floor."
29_LARR,Right.
29_SETH,"So, no. Floor registers are fine, for heating."
29_LARR,But th-... you're talking about wall regis-... putting em in the wall here.
29_SETH,"No, I was- I was thinking about putting em in the floor."
29_LARR,Oh in the floor.
29_SETH,"Yeah to-... to go in the wall, would be pretty tough."
29_LARR,Okay. Alright.
29_SETH,I don't know if you wanna cut the floor though.
29_LARR,Yeah. Well I hate to do it right there. May- maybe we'd do it right in here.
29_SETH,Yeah. But to get in the wall would be almost...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,"I mean you can do that during new construction, but it's tough when you're coming back after the fact, cause you just got."
29_LARR,Sure.
29_SETH,"Your- your two-by-four framing, and it's just too tough to get in there."
29_LARR,Okay. Alright. So we'd put a couple in this room somewhere. And then uh.
29_SETH,So this is like a family room. Is that what this is.
29_LARR,"Uh, it's kinda like a lo-... kinda a little parlor, library, something, resembles."
29_SETH,Alright...
29_LARR,"<XX>, <XX>. This is a register, so that's okay. Cause it's under there."
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,"The bathroom has a register, now that was it... <XX>."
29_SETH,How about the uh thermostat.
29_LARR,This guy.
29_SETH,Okay. I would definitely go with a new thermostat.
29_LARR,Yeah. Kind of a <XX> antique.
29_SETH,But that's probably a good... that's probably a good spot.
29_LARR,Isn't it.
29_SETH,"Yeah, that should be in a museum..."
29_LARR,"Uh, I don't know. I- i- are we doing the right. If I'm supposed to kinda walk you around the house here. Is that what uh."
29_SETH,Yeah. Do you think...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,"Well, I guess you haven't really."
29_LARR,I don't know if there's anything you need to do up here. Other than the fact just kinda know that we've got em.
29_SETH,"Yeah, you haven't r- really lived in the house during the winter. Have you."
29_LARR,No... And that's what we th-.
29_SETH,"So you don't really know, if there's a."
29_LARR,"See and that's what we thought we would do, uh."
29_SETH,"So you're not really sure if there's any problems, with heating certain areas."
29_LARR,That's right... so I sa-.
29_SETH,"So we don't know if there's any particular areas, like that b-. I bet you that parlor room has had a hard time, in the past."
29_LARR,Do you think it's pretty cool in there.
29_SETH,Just that one grill.
29_LARR,"And then this guy has a register, so."
29_SETH,Oh they got AC up here too.
29_LARR,Yeah. I n- I think that's gonna go.
29_SETH,"Well uh, especially if you get the forced air heating and cooling."
29_LARR,"Well, Yes."
29_SETH,You won't need that.
29_LARR,One little guy there.
29_SETH,"Yeah see these aren't strategically placed either, but you've pretty much got no choice. On most of these, these... it's almost impossible to to change these now, but really on the second floor."
29_LARR,This one's not too bad.
29_SETH,"The heat the heat's gonna rise, from the first floor anyway."
29_LARR,Yeah up to-. You know.
29_SETH,So I.
29_LARR,And it'll hold it in here real well.
29_SETH,"Yeah. Typically, and- if anything you have uh overheating problems."
29_LARR,Mm. Yeah.
29_SETH,On the second floor.
29_LARR,"Well see that's what we wanted to do, is have some kind of a system, that we know we can shut off. Certain certain areas. Like if w-."
29_SETH,"One of the things we could do, I don't think they have any dampers here. Do they. Oh they do."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,So you can close off.
29_LARR,Oh okay. So that's how it's.
29_SETH,Yeah you can close off individual d-.
29_LARR,Close these off...
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,And then the-... then it'll force the air what. Down into.
29_SETH,Downstairs. Now...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,"The one thing you don't wanna do though, is close off too many of em."
29_LARR,Cause then you put a strain on the.
29_SETH,"Cause cause then you're uh... yeah, you've gotta have a certain amount of air, for the furnace to work properly. And if you reduce the airflow too much, then it won't have enough air going across the heat exchanger, and it'll... it'll overheat the heat exchanger."
29_LARR,Oh. Really. Okay.
29_SETH,So I would say...
29_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,"You don't want to close more than uh, more than about twenty-five percent of em. Or you can close em, y you know, if you close em uh a- a hundred percent. If you close em all the way, you probably don't want to shut more than twenty-five percent of em. All the way..."
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,"Which would b-. I'm not sure, maybe all upstairs, you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit though."
29_LARR,Unhunh.
29_SETH,Just to make sure you get enough air.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"But, okay, so we'd be looking at adding two, two registers for that parlor room."
29_LARR,Adding two to that parlor room.
29_SETH,And then what about that one. Do you wanna hold off on that.
29_LARR,"Well, maybe we should just."
29_SETH,Or would you wanna do at least one of em.
29_LARR,"Uh I think we should do something, yeah. Only because."
29_SETH,Because if that remodel's a year away then.
29_LARR,I I th-. I guess I th-. I think this thing is gonna be a cold little.
29_SETH,"Oh, I can definitely see that."
29_LARR,"I I I can tell you that, because the windows."
29_SETH,"See you only like... the only heat you have in this room, is that one register over there."
29_LARR,The windows in this thing are just a bout ready to fall out. I mean they're... they're not. Look at this. So I know there's gonna be a lot of uh.
29_SETH,A lotta infiltration.
29_LARR,Yeah. Until we get this corrected.
29_SETH,See hopefully you'll go with double-pane glass on your remodel...
29_LARR,<XX>.
29_SETH,That'll help cut down a lot.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,On your.
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,Heat loss.
29_LARR,"So, I mean, uh in some ways, having windows, is it a bad idea. Because you get a lot of natural heat from the the s- from sun."
29_SETH,That's right.
29_LARR,You know.
29_SETH,Okay this is like it would get.
29_LARR,So.
29_SETH,This is like east facing. Right...
29_LARR,Yeah. The s- in in.
29_SETH,So you get some morning sun.
29_LARR,"You get the morning, in the winter, it's gonna come right across like this."
29_SETH,Yeah.
29_LARR,"So, <XX>."
29_SETH,So that's gonna be good.
29_LARR,"So that'll be good. So maybe one register in here for the moment, until we kinda feel it out would be uh."
29_SETH,"Sure. I mean this one it looks like, if we put a register over here, you wouldn't have to change it anyway."
29_LARR,Yeah. No that that.
29_SETH,"With your remodel, that might work into it."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,"And like I say, even i-... even if you do have to move it, it's not <XX> a big deal. I mean somebody just moves it."
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,"You know, a carpenter can do it even. You don't even need to have us come out and do it really. You might have to add a-... buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there, but it's not a."
29_LARR,Yeah.
29_SETH,Not a big deal.
29_LARR,Okay. Alright.
29_SETH,Okay.
29_LARR,Well that sounds good.
29_SETH,"Well let me check downstairs again, I gotta take some measurements on that room."
29_LARR,Okay. Well now you get... you've got the logistics of every-. Oh wait. And then I think my wife.
29_SETH,Now you... now you say about.
29_LARR,"My wife said she would like to have a register put in this room. And I think it's kinda weird, but, what do you think. Why would she."
29_SETH,What is this... what is this room used for.
29_LARR,"Well, eventually this is gonna be, uh, and we're gonna open this up. We're gonna take out some of these shelves, and get some light to come through here."
29_SETH,This is sort of like a pantry.
29_LARR,"But, kinda pantry area. But it's gonna be an extension of the kitchen. Kind of. So, I don't know if uh."
29_SETH,"I'd. Yeah, I'd put. I'd probably put one like right there. About right there..."
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,You gonna be putting anything there.
29_LARR,I think.
29_SETH,Probably something's gonna go there. Right. A table or something.
29_LARR,"I don't know. I, Yeah."
29_SETH,"Cause that's about the only spot you can put it. Well, I mean y- we could put a-... we could put a floor r- floor register right along here, I don't know if you'd want that. But that's probably where I'd put it. In fact the one that I was gonna put in there, I'd probably."
29_LARR,We might have trouble getting to this spot though. I think.
29_SETH,You think so.
29_LARR,"Yeah. Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end. Yeah. Well, let's uh."
29_SETH,Maybe on this end.
29_LARR,"Yeah. It would have to be, if anywhere, it'd have to be down..."
29_SETH,<XX> that's not a bad spot.
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,"It's gonna help out, cause I. See this whole area, you've just got that one grill. It's a pretty good-sized area right here."
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,What about the kitchen.
29_LARR,Well let's... let's consider that.
29_SETH,Kitchen's got one.
29_LARR,Kitchen's got one right here.
29_SETH,"Yeah, okay."
29_LARR,"And uh, I'm not too worried about the kitchen. I don't like hot kitchens anyway. Cause I mean y-... you got a stove going, and. Ah we're in good shape that way... ah. Wait a minute. Did I forget something else, too. Ah yeah. We're gonna have to put a register out here. Because y-, this this wall is eventually gonna come out. And so uh."
29_SETH,Utility room.
29_LARR,"Utility room, but it's gonna eventually be part of the kitchen. And we're moving the utility room. So, and this. T-. This is a joke. N look at this..."
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Well some of these...
29_LARR,"<XX>, Maybe maybe this doesn't make any sense, to."
29_SETH,Well some of these things you may wanna wait until you do the remodel. Like.
29_LARR,I'm th- I'm I'm wa- I'm beginning to wonder if.
29_SETH,"Because what I would prob-. What you can do, uh..."
29_LARR,<NONVERBAL>
29_SETH,Is tap right off the plenum. Cause the furnace is somewhere in that general area.
29_LARR,"It's right there, yeah."
29_SETH,"And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct, and bring it to this room."
29_LARR,Okay. Well that's what we wanted to.
29_SETH,So that can be done.
29_LARR,That's what we wanna kn- wanna know.
29_SETH,That can be done at a later time.
29_LARR,Alright. But maybe t-.
29_SETH,That can be done at at any time.
29_LARR,Maybe for the sake of your quotation.
29_SETH,Really.
29_LARR,"You should say, this is what it's gonna cost you to put in a duct here, all these ducts, at this time."
29_SETH,Yeah. Okay.
29_LARR,"Now I don't know if... if we can price em out individually, or not."
29_SETH,"Sure. I call this what, utility r- utility room."
29_LARR,Yeah. Just pu- uh call it a.
29_SETH,Figure a duct somewhere on this wall you think.
29_LARR,Yeah. Let's just assume it'd be on this wall.
29_SETH,"Okay. Utility room kitchen, that back one we'll call that pantry."
29_LARR,"Yeah. Pantry, and then you got the dining room glass."
29_SETH,Dining room.
29_LARR,Glass dining room.
29_SETH,And then the parlor.
29_LARR,"And then the parlor, one on each end there..."
29_SETH,"Yeah. Cause we can do em now, or we can do em later. But it's not any more difficult to do em at a later time. So it's not like you have to do it now."
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,"So the registers that we're connecting to, that are existing, how many of those we have got. We've got the one in the kitchen, and then we've got uh, one in the d- living room here."
29_LARR,"That guy, then there's one in the bathroom, there's one in the s study, and there is one in the library. Or in the parlor. I don't know what we'd do with that. Do we disconnect that, if we put two, or do you leave it."
29_SETH,"Uh, yeah I might disconnect that. Well it's not it's not connected up right now. So."
29_LARR,Oh that's right.
29_SETH,"So it'd just be a matter w-. Actually it sh-... it should be capped off probably though. And this is the study, one right there, and the bathroom's got one."
29_LARR,"Bathroom's got one, over by the shower there. On the floor."
29_SETH,"Okay. Okay, let me take a look downstairs again."
29_LARR,Okay.
29_SETH,<NONVERBAL>
