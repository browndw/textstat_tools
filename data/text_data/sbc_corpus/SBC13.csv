13_WEND,"Does, She doesn't have to work, does she."
13_KEND,"She doesn't have to, unless, you know, I guess Scott's making some good bucks."
13_MARC,"Yeah but they bought like three cars in a row. She had that one, and they sold that, and bought two others."

13_MARC,<NONVERBAL>
13_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
13_KEND,Uh-oh.
13_WEND,Oh.

13_MARC,"What you don't know, will hurt you."
13_KEND,What are we doing here...
13_WEND,Does somebody want some presents.

13_WEND,<NONVERBAL>
13_KEN,That is the clue...
13_KEND,<NONVERBAL>
13_KEVI,"She might not have mentioned, but that is the clue."
13_KEND,I was thinking it was wishing you a day of little treasures...

13_WEND,Sure. Doesn't matter.
13_KEND,Or is it okay.
13_MARC,Appease the monster.
13_KEND,"What is this... s- Feels like a pair and a spare, dad..."
13_WEND,<NONVERBAL>

13_WEND,"It's not green, I'm sorry..."
13_KEND,<NONVERBAL>
13_MARC,They don't come in green.
13_KEVI,We bought it before you had an apartment.
13_KEND,"No my plates are blue, that's okay. That's okay, my plates are blue."
13_MARC,She's gonna do blue and green. She doesn't need green.

13_KEND,"It's a beautiful cake, but why do you guys always give me ice cream cakes."

13_KEND,Buddy...
13_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
13_KEVI,Are they the-. Are they the double whammy ones.
13_WEND,"I'll tell you what-, uh though uh, for the effort, this sounds really bad. But for the effort, the time that it takes to go out and get em, and install em, I'd rather pay the money, cause."
13_KEVI,"Oh, I would too."
13_WEND,Our time is...

13_KEND,<NONVERBAL>
13_MARC,"A church down south, a little tiny one..."
13_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
13_MARC,"And when Edna told me about it, it was because they sort of wanted to go, to a smaller congregation."
13_KEVI,Hm.
13_MARC,"But when they announced it in church, and we prayed for them, it was because, they, um, they were gonna go out uh, because they felt called. So."
13_KEVI,Hm.
13_MARC,"I don't know what the real story is, but, it sounded kinda neat."
13_KEVI,Hm.

13_MARC,Yeah.
13_WEND,"They're neat, they're really neat, in fact."
