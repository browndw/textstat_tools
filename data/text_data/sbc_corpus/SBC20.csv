20_JEFF,"We often meditate, I think, on the love of Christ, and there are many ways to do it, and those who have meditated on the love of Christ, have often done so, in terms of the cross itself, have imagined again and afresh, uh, his uh bleeding wounds, uh see him as he died on the cross, but..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Wherever we turn... uh in considering the love of Christ... we turn always to the Gospel records, don't we. We we turn to the Word of God. We turn to the real Jesus, as he's described. And uh, There- there is where our meditation always centers..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"That we might know him, and uh see the wonder of his love. And not only hear him as he cries, why have you forsaken me, but uh, see him also, in his seeking love, as the risen Lord. Uh see him uh, with that fish breakfast, by the Lake of Galilee. Broiling fish. Don't you like that. You know he had that uh, he had that breakfast all cooking. While the disciples were still out in the boat. And then uh, of course he has a special interview with Peter. Not the first time he'd seen him, he made a special resurrection appearance, uh to Peter. But uh, there in the morning, early morning, in the Lake of Galilee. And there are cocks crowing in the distance. And Jesus says to Peter, do you love me, more than these. Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me, more than these. Three times the question..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Because, you see, as uh we were saying a bit ago, the love and the service go together. Don't they. If Peter is to be restored in service, he has to be restored in love. And when Peter says, uh, I love you, then Jesus says, uh, feed my sheep, tend my lambs, care for my little ones. We... we can't love others, in the name of Christ, unless the love for others is a overflow, of our love for the Lord himself. The people that we're called to love, are unfortunately, not, uh, warrantably lovable... uh We uh, uh The source of our love, is not how appealing they are, although, we can praise God for his image in them, and rejoice in the many evidences of God's common grace in their lives, but, nevertheless, uh basically, the the fountain of our love, i- is uh, the seeking love of the savior. The self-denying love. That is uh willing to serve in his name. Do you love me. You know, uh Jesus didn't ask Peter those questions, to undercut his love, or his faith. He asked those questions to establish it. And uh Jesus does the same with you, my friend, he does the same. He does ask you, this morning, do you love me. Do you really love me. But he asks it, in order that you'll be able to say at last with Peter, Lord, you know everything. You know my heart. And Lord you know that in spite of everything, yes Lord I do love you. Well, the saving love of uh the Father, and the Son, is also the saving love of the Spirit... and that's why I read that section from Romans eight. Uh you see, God's love is is present in the Spirit... uh There there's a wonderful theology of the Spirit, in uh, in the Scriptures... uh uh Especially of course in the New Testament, Um, Bultmann, in his uh commentary on uh Romans eight, uh, uh talks about, uh, the two ways in which the Spirit i- is spoken of. And uh, uh he unfortunately uses anthropological terms to describe it, uh, he talks about uh, the the the Spirit in uh, the sense of mana, as in uh animism, where the spirit, you have a spirit of of a tree, or a a stone, or something like that, and then you have the more personal concept of the Spirit... uh uh, both an impersonal and a personal concept of the Spirit. Now, I d- I don't care for his analogy, but uh the point is well taken. Uh, the point is that Paul does speak of the Spirit, both as possessor, and as possessed. You see, the Spirit possesses us. Uh, as Christians, we are not demon possessed, we are Holy Spirit possessed. And uh, Holy Spirit possession, has a close relationship to demon possession... uh, the close relationship is what makes it so different... uh You see, uh demon possession is always destructive, because uh Satan can't create. And the demon-possessed man in Gadare. Remember... uh he couldn't even give his name. When Jesus asked him what his name was. Uh he-. His personality was destroyed. You know how C S Lewis has done that in his uh, uh adult novels. Uh, uh but uh, there it is... uh S- uh demon possession is personality destructive. It depersonalizes, because uh Satan can only corrode, he can't create. He can only destroy. But, Holy Spirit pos session, is no less real possession, only, it has the op posite effect. The Holy Spirit, you see, is the cre ator Spirit, who brought uh order out of chaos, the Holy Spirit is the one who orders, the Holy Spirit is the one who frees, uh liberates, uh the-... uh the- the- the- Gadarene demoniac thought he was free, because nobody could tie him up, you see..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"He could go anywhere, do anything, uh absolute freedom. Right... uh and he could treat people... he hi- he didn't have to dress any particular way, no dress code, and so he stripped it all off. And the he uh, he could uh d- treat people any way he wanted to, so whenever they came by, he beat them up. And uh..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh and uh then, if there was nobody handy to beat up, he picked up a stone, and uh tore his own flesh apart. There's demonic liberty. But uh, Holy Spirit liberty doesn't work that way. See. Uh, uh now uh um, you'll accuse me of thinking uh of Holy Spirit liberty, in too strictly Presbyterian terms, because uh..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"I remind you, that that man, once he was delivered, was seated clothed, and in his right mind..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh and uh, And we'll pass over other uh uh Scriptural accounts..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Like the lame man healed, by the Beautiful Gate at the temple, who went in leaping and dancing and praising the Lord..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"See that, uh that's a little different, but, But uh uh you Presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order. Uh but, but the Holy Spirit, remember, is the spirit of both. Right. He's the spirit of order, he's the spirit of ardor. And- and the Holy Spirit, uh uh uhuh is the one, uh who has uh, ordered our lives. And as he possesses us. He orders us. And he gives us the order of love. If you love me, Jesus said, keep my commandments. Uh I wanna say a little bit more about that in a moment. The obedience of love. But the Holy Spirit is the one who orders our lives, uh, controls our lives, is in possession of our lives, but the Holy Spirit's also given to us, see, he's not only the possessor, he's also the one who is possessed. We possess him. He dwells in our hearts. Uh, we have not only the gifts of the Spirit, in the plural, but we have the gift of the Spirit, We have the Holy Spirit himself, given to us. The promise of the Father. Uh they- the disciples were to wait, until that great promise was given, the gift of the Holy Spirit. And so the Holy Spirit given to us, uh f-... works in us. Uh, that sense of the presence of God's love. And that's why uh Paul says, in Romans five, that God pours out his love in our hearts. By the Holy Spirit. Now, uh there, the love that's poured out, does not describe the love that we have for God, although that is the fruit of the Spirit you know, love joy peace so on. Uh, but uh in that passage, in Romans five, Paul isn't talking about uh, the gift of love that we have for God, he's talking about the gift of love that God has for us. Because he goes on to describe that love of God. God commends his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. So it's God's love for us, that's poured out in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit given to us... uh Which is uh, again... uh, a wonderful reality. Because, if God didn't do that, uh, we wouldn't have a love for God. There's no spring of that divine love within us. It comes from him. And it does come from him, and he does give it. And so the Spirit is the spirit of uh adoption. The spirit of sonship. Now, to be the spirit of sonship, he has to be also the spirit of fatherhood, right. Uh to make us a ware, that we are children of God, uh we have to know, that he is our father. And so, it is the love of God, made real to our hearts, the knowledge that he does love us, that he is present with us, that uh becomes of course then the source, of our uh love toward him. Um, uh friends..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh, there's... there's nothing more important. For the whole balance, and stability, and progress, and growth, of our Christian lives. Than, uh to realize, again, and again, and again, the uh, the wonder, of our union with Jesus Christ. Through the Spirit. Because it's in Jesus Christ that we are united to the Father, and it is by the Spirit that Christ is present in our hearts, and it's by the Spirit that the Father is present in our hearts. Two aspects of union with Christ, i- I think you all know this theology, but it always pays to think about it again. The representative union, the vital union. The representative union. The basis of our salvation. When Christ died, we died. Because he died for us. He died as our representative, he died in our place, uh he died as uh, uh the one, uh uh who bore our sins. In his own body, on the tree. So he was our representative. Right. And he represented us, not only as Paul teaches, not only when he died for us, but when he rose for us. And then he ascended, into the heavenly places, and where he is, we are. And that's why Paul says in Ephesians, that we are in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus. Why. Representatively. Where he is, we are. Now, that's a tremendously, important of course, foundational, life-transforming truth. It's happened. See, you are a a new creature in Christ, because you're united to him. You have triumphed over sin and death. You have died to sin. And Paul's reasoning about how we ought to live, is always grounded in that..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh you know, in Colossians. Uh, it's because, Christ rose, that we are to seek the things which are above. You are risen with Christ. Seek the things which are above. Because you died with Christ, therefore mortify sin in your members. Put to death sin, because it has died. In other words, the imperative is always grounded in the indicative. Because of what Christ did for us, therefore, uh we live out of the fact, the reality, the accomplishment, of his perfect work. And don't forget, Jesus not only paid the price of your sins, but remember that he lived a perfect life for you. That the white robe of righteousness, that you wear in that last day, is the robe of Christ's righteousness. So, it's all that Christ did for you... uh uh uh Jesus was baptized for you. Uh let it be done to fill all righteousness. The righteousness he had to fill for you. See he he did it all for you. But then of course the other side of it is, it's not only representative, it's also vital. Jesus Christ is the vine, and we are the branches. Y- we're united to him. Our life is drawn from Christ. There is the uh, uh not only the the the legal uh aspect of that which Christ did for us, as our representative, there is the vital aspect, of what Christ does in us, as he lives in us, and dwells in us, and has fellowship with us, and and we walk with him. Uh, uh every... uh y- y- you know, i- uhuhuh it's uh, it's been long fashionable in theological circles to uh, sniff at the hymn, uh I walked in the garden alone, while the dew was still on the roses, you know, uh all this uh romantic business, and uh, and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn, and yet everybody perversely seems to love it. Uh well uh, uh, I I I think, I think the reason it's so loved, in spite of its uh, uh uh theological vacuity, uh is that it's uh experientially..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh uhuh pretty much on target... We've all known those uh precious times of uh of genuine fellowship with the Lord, that uh, uh that- uh... we can describe only with great difficulty. And uh, it's true, you see, uh, we are vitally united to Jesus Christ. Uh we do know him, and the knowledge that we have of him, is the knowledge of love... uh We just simply love him. Uh, we uh, uh ow the mystics, the Christian myth- mystics, l- love to talk about uh... we've got some kind of time constraint here, what uh uh uh what-..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,W- w- w- when do we.
20_DAN,I think.
20_JEFF,When.
20_DAN,I think we're done when you are... so.
20_JEFF,"Well, I I gotta be."
20_DAN,Finish what you have to say.
20_JEFF,"I I well. I'll I yeah. Let me try to finish what I'm talking about here but, but uh, there- there-. I don't often get chance, to talk to types like you, you know it's wonderful..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"uh it's particularly wonderful, cause I know you know everything I'm saying anyway s so, you can smile affirmatively, and that encourages me, that's great... uh but..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"But uh, but, uh really, the- the- that uh, you know the Christian mystics talked about climbing Jacob's ladder. And uh, uh you you you'd come up the ladder, and when you get at the top, you fling yourself down, at the very gate of heaven. And maybe uh, maybe the gate will open. Y- you can't control it, you don't know when it will open, but maybe it will open. And when it opens, then, uh it's uh, light bursting in your inner heart. And uh, once you've had that experience, you'd give anything to have the experience repeated. And so uh, you go through any amount of discipline, and uh, try out different forms of discipline, and uh, you recite the Jesus prayer thousands of times with the monks of Mount Athos, and uh, and uh, sooner or later, uh you think it may happen. Uh the uh, you you may gain that experience. Well now uh, you know, there are experiences of ecstasy, tha- uh, that can be induced by a transformation of consciousness, and uh, I think Christians sometimes have uh, uh mingled that uh psychological experience, uh, whether it's the left part or, or the right part of the brain taking over, or something, uh I don't think um, uh, the um, the psychologists are as sure as they once were, or even the neurologists about how some of those things happen, but uh, uh at any rate, uh, uh you see..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh it isn't that we have to climb the ladder. And uh, I'm I'm sorry that that whole episode with Jacob got misunderstood. All because uh, all because of the Hebrew preposition al. That uh, wasn't taken account of. Uh that see, uh, he he stood uh upon, not it... ee, he uh Jacob st- saw the stairway, not a painter's ladder of course, but a, a tower of Babel type of thing, a uh, a zigarot... r- right. You got a zigarot and, which was made for the gods to touch down at the top, and then they could come down uh, to the bottom. You know it was like a little heliport for the gods there. That was he idea..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"But but uh, th- they they'd come down, there'd be a temple at the bottom, and then uh the god could be with the people. But uh..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh but it it wasn't that that God... that that uh Jacob saw God at the top of the ladder, up in Heaven, uh God stood uh upon him. Uh the the masculine uh there, the uh, v- v- v- vowel with the little dot over it, you know the the the holem. Uh he he he's uh, uh uh he stood upon him... uh, which is the common Hebrew expression, and you know that's what it is, because the second time when God appeared to b- uhuh uh uh j- Jacob at Bethel, uh, the same expression is used. He went up from upon him. See. Uh, it's the same expression. So, God had come down the ladder. That's what we miss. He wasn't standing up there at the top, uh he came down the ladder. And uh uh when he came down the ladder, he stood over Jacob, and revealed himself to Jacob. And that's why Jacob said, this is the house of God, this is the gate of Heaven. It was the House of God, he said, because God was in this place, and I didn't know it. See, it- it's, this is Bethel here, because here God has come to us. So God was revealing himself to Jacob, and God reveals himself to us. He comes to us. And uh, he seeks us. As we seek him. And our love is always in response to his love. And it's the assurance that your God loves you... that he seeks you... that he's with you. That he comes to you. It's this assurance, that draws you to repentance, and draws you to faith, and draws you to himself. Um, the uh, uh, salvation is of the Lord. And uh, it's the Lord's love, who quickens your love. Well, I'm not going to say, uh th- the rest of the things I I had in mind to say, But, uh I, uh you can fill out the talk for me, would you please sometime... the the commitment of love, the obedience of love. If you love me keep my commandments. Um, uh remember, uh Mary's adoration, Uh when she uh brought the spikenard, and uh, opened it and poured it out on the feet of Jesus, just before he went to the cross. And Judas criticized her remember, Uh because, he said, this could have been given to the poor, uh, he- he- he was the first old-fashioned liberal. Don't worship Jesus, but help the poor. Uh, but uh..."
20_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"Uh y- you see, uh, uh, w- what- what was the answer. What was the answer that Jesus uh gave. Uh, uh, n- let her do this. Let her keep it. Not in the sense of preserving the ointment, she was pouring it out, but in the sense of observing it. Observing a a an observance against his burial. Uh so, she realized what his death meant, and she realized who he was. He said the poor you have with you always, but me, you have not always. A tremendous assurance of his own deity. Who else could say something like that. Hunh. But Jesus said it, and uh, uh you see what that says to us. Uh, if our Lord were here, then we could pour out perfume on his feet. He's not here. But who is. The poor you have with you always. So whose feet can we anoint. The feet of the poor, in his name. See. Uh, love uh uh doesn't mean, uh uh uh climbing up Jacob's ladder uh to the heavenlies, uh where nobody else can be around. The love of God is experienced in the community of the saints, it's experienced as we all reached out... reach out... to the breadth, and the length, and the height, and the depth, and the love of God is experienced, in the course of service. A- I heard you describe some of these service projects, that uh, um Intervarsity is involved in, and friends, um, these these projects, even if uh they're working about rebuilding old houses, or whatever, they are not things that have nothing to do with love. They are works of love. They are the evidence, of that love of God, in our hearts. Uh they are the fruit, that is borne, by the tree, that has the roots down into the water of God's refreshing grace and love. And uh, the mystical heights of Christian devotion, ought never to be separated from the realities, of uh Christian service. The uh, there was a hymn in the old InterVarsity hymnal, it's not in the new one, by <XX> <XX>, a hymn that I love v- very much. Talks about how we go with Jesus through the desert, and through uh, the sufferings, and the trials of this life. And uh, its very last verse is uh, he who in his hour of sorrow, bore the curse alone, I who through the lonely desert, trod where he had gone. He and I, in that bright glory..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"One deep joy shall share. Mine, to be forever with him. His, that I am there. My friends, in the wonder of God's love. He's pleased with you. God who looked at his own Son, and his heart rejoiced. His heart rejoices this morning. In your praise. In your worship. In the service of your hands. In the love of your heart. Shall we pray. Our heavenly Father, we cannot find words to express our love for you, because we are overwhelmed by your love for us. Lord Jesus, how may we speak to you, of that which you give to us. Spirit of God, how we praise you, that when we do not know what to pray as we should, you make intercession for us, with groanings that cannot be uttered. And o Lord, receive we pray this morning, the incense of our love for you..."
20_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
20_JEFF,"And forbid Lord, that this should be just a passing emotion in our hearts, uh burn it upon the deepest recesses of our being. Make us Lord your servants. Your servants in love. We ask it in Jesus's name, amen."
20_DAN,Doctor Mosely thank you...
20_JEFF,<NONVERBAL>
20_DAN,For.
20_AUD,Yeah.
20_DAN,Coming and speaking to us.
20_JEFF,N yeah...
