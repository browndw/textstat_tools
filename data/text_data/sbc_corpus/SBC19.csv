19_FRAN,"Well, with all-."
19_MELI,Not before I graduate.
19_FRAN,"Well, they're really concerned about these proposals on the ballot, for next week... or two weeks from now, or whenever it is, next week I guess."
19_MELI,Mom... do I really have to go through and r- read this...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,To make sure that I didn't leave out any of my sentences or anything.
19_JAN,You need to make progress... not go back over what you've already done.
19_MELI,"Okay, because out of the eight that I've done, I notice on one of them I skipped two sentences. They weren't really important, but I did skip two of em... and so now I'm paranoid that I'm gonna skip a bunch more so I have to go back and proofread... does it matter."
19_JAN,"Not at this point, You should be making progress..."
19_MELI,Okay...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_JAN,Your ten minutes are up.
19_MELI,And I've proofread the whole thing... uh.
19_JAN,How many pages do you have to copy.
19_MELI,"Excuse me. Just two more... actually, that."
19_JAN,"Okay, I'm gonna check on you in ten minutes, if you haven't gotten one page done, in ten minutes you'll go-."
19_MELI,"One side of a page. It takes me a long time, because I've got to go over the sentences, figure out, if I'm gonna rewrite them or leave them the same, and just write them out."
19_JAN,Well y-.
19_MELI,"I can't write them exactly the way they are, because they stink."
19_JAN,Then you need to go downstairs and finish it.
19_MELI,I'm fine.
19_FRAN,"Melissa, it's nine o'clock."
19_MELI,I'm not gonna do any better downstairs.
19_FRAN,It's nine o'clock in the evening.
19_JAN,You also have algebra to do.
19_MELI,I can skip algebra.
19_FRAN,No you can't.
19_JAN,No... you-.
19_MELI,Alright fine. I'll do my algebra then.
19_JAN,"No, you ge- take that downstairs... right now."
19_FRAN,"Ho- ho- honey, You need to be able to concentrate and get it done."
19_JAN,And don't argue.
19_FRAN,"You've visited with Ron, and you'll also see him on the weekend."
19_MELI,So what.
19_JAN,Well...
19_MELI,That was rude...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,You know...
19_MELI,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,"She knows it too, she did it on purpose."
19_JAN,"Take it downstairs. Or, are you listening."
19_MELI,Are you gonna add like the little lines that jut out of these.
19_FRAN,Get your pen back from that.
19_BRET,Yeah... uh.
19_MELI,"It's erasable, and I am not marking on it."
19_BRET,I don't care if it's erasable. Don't touch it.
19_MELI,I didn't.
19_BRET,I know... don't.
19_MELI,That's actually very good lettering sir.
19_BRET,I know.
19_JAN,This is your final.
19_MELI,"Mom, you gave me another ten minutes."
19_JAN,Warning. No I didn't.
19_FRAN,"No, no longer."
19_JAN,I have retracted it...
19_MELI,<NONVERBAL>
19_JAN,"You argued with me long enough, I changed my mind."
19_MELI,"Okay, I retract all my arguing. I totally agree. I should go downstairs. Now can I stay up here."
19_JAN,No...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,Doesn't work in this household.
19_FRAN,"You may use my desk. Well wait a minute, it's a royal mess, isn't it."
19_MELI,Yes it is.
19_FRAN,You'll just have to carefully set things aside.
19_BRET,Symphony.
19_FRAN,And I'll go through the piles.
19_RON,A.
19_JAN,We can go down there and sit.
19_BRET,Dun da-da-dum.
19_FRAN,At my earliest convenience.
19_BRET,Da-da-da-dun dun da-da-da.
19_JAN,You wanna go down there and sit.

19_MELI,"You guys, I wanna be able to be with you."
19_FRAN,Did dad watch Perot.
19_BRET,So do.
19_FRAN,Last night.
19_BRET,Unh...
19_RON,I don't think so.
19_FRAN,"And, recorded the game. I figured he'd be interested in hearing him at least."
19_BRET,Excuse me.
19_JAN,Well his mind's made up.
19_BRET,Uh.
19_FRAN,"Well I know that... but it might just be fun t-, to listen to him..."
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"One thing is, never bring up politics with my grandpa Hutch... because, you'll get in a big family..."
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,Argument.
19_JAN,Excuse me.
19_MELI,"And Mom. Or no... was it Grandpa Flynn. Well anyway, either way."
19_FRAN,It is not pleasant to talk about it with either one of em...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,Uh Either way.
19_FRAN,Believe me...
19_MELI,"I made some comment, I made some stupid comment, like why are you voting for them... or something like that. And then uh, they went on, for like, an hour... or the whole dinner time... which was probably forty-five minutes... about..."
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"The political views, and all this other stuff. And they just talked about it, on and on and on and on and on. And so Mom told me never ever to ask."
19_FRAN,Maybe I'll have tea.
19_MELI,Anything about that again.
19_FRAN,Could you grab me a box of tea.
19_MELI,That was Grandpa Flynn. I asked him something about the Democratic Platform...
19_X,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,Like what all do they believe.
19_FRAN,"Oh here, we got this. I'll just use that."
19_MELI,Dumb question.
19_RON,"It's not pleasant to talk about politics with anyone who doesn't believe... uh d- not believe, but doesn't."
19_MELI,Agree with you.
19_RON,"Vote in the same way that you vote, or whatever... <XX>."
19_MELI,I don't vote.
19_RON,It's hardly ever pleasant.
19_MELI,So.
19_FRAN,It has a real way...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"Of stifling conversation and, It's just like tonight at that in-service... uh Noble, whatever her name is, was sitting, on this side... and she says something about."
19_MELI,Angie Noble.
19_FRAN,Clinton.
19_MELI,Angie Noble.
19_FRAN,"And about. I forget what she said, you know, about supporting Clinton and, and was just kind of... something about that, and Donna here and there she says, well, I don't know she says, I'm gonna vote for the other guy, it's like, end of conversation, let's just, be quiet folks..."
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,I don't wanna hear any more...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"Missis Noble's definitely very democratic. Mom, I'm going... because she's pro-choice. Anyway, I think that isn't... not a good reason to base your decision though..."
19_X,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,<XX> <XX>.
19_BRET,"See I didn't miss anything. Good. Then I can get one of our great erasers, and just... go."
19_RON,Wh-. Why is there a exclamation point.
19_BRET,There isn't one anymore.
19_MELI,Cause it's.
19_BRET,It's going to be erased.
19_RON,"Oh, I see."
19_MELI,"Cause it's not symphony, it's symphony..."
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_X,Like that.
19_FRAN,"What are you gonna do with this thing, Brett."
19_BRET,Draw on uh...
19_MELI,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,Where.
19_RON,There's erasers in there.

19_FRAN,Uh. Violinist.
19_RON,Hm.
19_FRAN,"Who makes his living, from doing this."
19_X,Mhm.
19_FRAN,I think. He's really good. Oh.
19_BRET,Hm.
19_FRAN,"Boy, really good. Understatement. So it was pretty neat, we hadn't been to a concert in, I don't know when... uh this symphony does pretty good, for being a little one horse Southwestern Michigan Symphony, you know it. And Vodnoy, the conductor's been here now, it's been uh eighteen years."
19_BRET,"I wanna go see the Kalamazoo, Symphony sometime."
19_FRAN,It's been okay...
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_RON,What's the symphony called here.
19_FRAN,"I'll. Well, they call it. I think they call it Southwestern Michigan Symphony now."
19_RON,Hm.
19_BRET,They do uh.
19_FRAN,"Because they draw a lot of people from, you know like music teachers from Kalamazoo, and."
19_RON,"Mhm. Who play in it, you mean."
19_FRAN,Yeah... who play in it.
19_RON,Mhm...
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"And uh, I remember hearing some guys complaining, like years ago, when we first moved here, they call it Twin Cities, but they let all these people come in and take over all the first chairs, and all this stuff."
19_RON,Unhunh.
19_FRAN,"You know <XX>, so they changed it, and uh, Don't put that on the floor. Try to take it to a wastebasket, cause there's so much, okay. They did a pretty nice job."
19_JAN,You know.
19_FRAN,And we got this new <XX> center out here.
19_JAN,Are all those.

19_FRAN,"But they get paid a little. But they have to belong to the musicians' union, And, it's not really high paying, I mean, It's sel-."
19_RON,You can't live off of it.
19_FRAN,"No no. It's it-. I think, for performances."
19_BRET,I know somebody who makes a living as a d- musician.
19_FRAN,I think it's so much an hour for performances.
19_JAN,Hm.
19_FRAN,I don't think they-. I don't think they get paid for all that rehearsal time...
19_BRET,My cello teacher.
19_FRAN,I could ask John Nelson.
19_BRET,Makes his living off of.
19_FRAN,He'd know.
19_BRET,Playing the cello.
19_MELI,But he's. But see he's a teacher though. He makes his money teaching.
19_BRET,He teaches Saturdays... in Verrian Springs and here.

19_MELI,Does he teach just cello.
19_BRET,What.

19_FRAN,Really be able to work.
19_RON,It's hard getting the clientele.
19_FRAN,"Yeah, it sounds like, this is strictly, you know like on a school year, strictly, a weekend. Of course he comes down here on the weekends..."
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"I suppose he has, afternoon, evening, or whatever students... maybe up in Kalamazoo."
19_BRET,I'm sure he practices tons every day.
19_FRAN,"Maybe he goes different places. Maybe he... he's in Kalamazoo, but like well if he c- comes here, maybe he goes some place else."
19_RON,Does he live in Kalamazoo.
19_FRAN,Not too far.

19_RON,Does he teach in the school system too. Or.
19_FRAN,"M-m. He's strictly, pri-... he's not married or anything, and I think strictly private lessons, and orchestra."
19_RON,Hm.
19_FRAN,"Just totally cello. I thought maybe he was a music teacher too, But, But did you tell me he wasn't."
19_BRET,He's not.

19_BRET,Ha ha.
19_FRAN,With a cello in your hand... sitting down.
19_BRET,Hm.
19_MELI,With a cello in your hand. Cellos are a bit big for that.
19_BRET,"Sort of like, <XX>..."
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,You could practically do that with a quarter-sized violin... fit it in your hand...
19_JAN,Bob came by this afternoon.
19_FRAN,Bob who.
19_JAN,Um Ashton.
19_BRET,Ash-tone.

19_MELI,That's not late.
19_RON,I guess that's true...
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,Yeah but we uh also got up an hour later than usual...
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,Uh.
19_MELI,Course that's not saying much.
19_FRAN,"I think it's the end of that excuse dear. The time has changed, it's."
19_MELI,When he awaked...

19_FRAN,"Ah, you could probably use that."
19_BRET,At its highest level of maturity.
19_MELI,"Well, it says, it says, I bet it was fun for him, when he awaked, at the silence... and, blah blah blah lah..."
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,<XX> something like that.
19_BRET,Uh.
19_MELI,When he awaked.
19_JAN,When he awoke.
19_BRET,Yeah.
19_MELI,"I bet it was fun for him when he awoke, at the silence."
19_BRET,He awokeded at the silence.
19_MELI,"And he got to hear Cousin Simmons and the Reverend, saying fine things about him. Have you guys ever imagined yourself dead, just to see what people would think about you."
19_JAN,No.
19_FRAN,Would you just.
19_MELI,And what they would say about you.
19_FRAN,Continue your work.

19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_JAN,Past tense. She died.
19_FRAN,Very suddenly.
19_JAN,Yeah.
19_FRAN,She's what. How old.
19_JAN,Thirty- two. Thirty-six.
19_FRAN,Thirty-six.
19_RON,Hm.
19_FRAN,Uh they're on the mission field in Africa.
19_JAN,Yeah. Yeah.
19_RON,Oh when she died.
19_FRAN,"And, out in, out in tribal... tribal villages. Although they were in the city."
19_RON,Mhm.
19_FRAN,"At the time, right."
19_JAN,Right.
19_FRAN,In town. But apparently it was either a heart attack or an aneurysm.
19_RON,Hm.
19_FRAN,"And they suspect an aneurysm, it was extremely quick, I guess."
19_RON,Hm.
19_MELI,Mom said it was a cerebral hemorrhage... which is an aneurysm...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,But.
19_FRAN,I suppose they're the same.
19_MELI,"Yeah, they are."
19_FRAN,But since I'm not a doctor.
19_RON,Hm.
19_MELI,But.
19_FRAN,I.
19_MELI,But Mom said that's what it was...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"But, I don't know. She could be wrong..."
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"And they weren't going to do an autopsy, they figured, it would serve no useful purpose."
19_RON,Hm.
19_FRAN,"It had to be one of the two, they figured."
19_BRET,I'll color this in at school...
19_FRAN,<XX>.
19_BRET,"At school, you can color it in."
19_FRAN,"Yeah, so anyway, that was real sudden."
19_BRET,Cause they have the big markers.
19_FRAN,Last week. Last Thursday as a matter of fact.
19_BRET,Hm.
19_FRAN,Well.
19_MELI,How are you gonna make the strings. Are you gonna leave the little white areas.
19_FRAN,This past Wednesday...
19_BRET,I'm just gonna make the lines here...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_JAN,What do you say.
19_BRET,I'll do something.
19_MELI,"What-. Which sounds better. I bet it was fun for him when he awoke, or I bet it was fun for him when he awakened."
19_JAN,Awoke... <XX>.
19_FRAN,Try awakened...
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"Oh, that's helpful..."
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,Uh.
19_MELI,"Well, I'll say awakened, cause that's what I have written down..."
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"Just watch, he'll put a note by it-... note by that. I really like that word Melissa..."
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,Leave me alone...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"And you you could say, my father gave me that word."
19_MELI,I would have put awaked...
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"But really, I think everyone in this family should read this book."
19_BRET,But I really.
19_MELI,It would be... you would enjoy it Brett.
19_BRET,Yes I'm sure...
19_JAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"Gee, aren't we in a nice mood today."
19_BRET,Yes we are. I'm all cheerful...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,"Hm hmhm. Oh, boy... <XX> <XX> <XX>."
19_MELI,We could make.
19_FRAN,"Well starting in November, we're gonna be looking at the sky. I have a day by day November calendar, of where to look, and what to look for..."
19_MELI,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"As in planets, it's pretty neat looking."
19_RON,Do you have a telescope.
19_FRAN,"Well no I-, just naked eye stuff."
19_MELI,He has a telescope though.
19_FRAN,"Well, it's, uh easier to do naked eye."
19_BRET,"Oh, well gee. Multiplies forty times..."
19_FRAN,Or or binoculars.
19_MELI,Oops. It does pretty good when you can find the moon. The only thing is.
19_FRAN,"Well it's just not a quality instrument, Brett."
19_MELI,It's impossible to find anything.
19_FRAN,Our binoculars would be just as well worth taking.
19_BRET,Hello Ron.
19_JAN,Let's go and sit in the living room.
19_FRAN,We did this thing about...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"We were talking about how, in science books and you see the solar system, How it's so out of scale, and uh, you cannot get a scale for d-..."
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_FRAN,"Distance, and at the same time get objects, that can give you the scale for the size of the planets."
19_BRET,Nice <XX>.
19_FRAN,But we're trying to do a scale for... they had this thing drawn for a scale for uh distance...
19_RON,Mhm.
19_FRAN,"So, we started at one end of the hallway with a roll of toilet paper."
19_RON,Oh. Unhunh.
19_FRAN,"And it has so many sheets of toilet paper, and you roll out, and so you go so many, and we were way down the hall like, four-hundred and eighty-three, you know s-, Pieces of toi-."
19_BRET,Toilet sheets later.
19_MELI,Where were you.
19_RON,Yeah.
19_MELI,That you could have that l-.
19_FRAN,For Jupiter. For Jupiter.
19_MELI,How far...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"Were you, to do that. Distance like how wide it is, diameter."
19_FRAN,"Four-hundred and eighty-three, like four-and-a-half-inch squares of toilet paper."
19_MELI,No but.
19_FRAN,Down the.
19_MELI,"Where were you-, in the hall. What hall-. In in your school."
19_FRAN,Well it was at Fair Plain West School.
19_MELI,Is that the junior high.
19_FRAN,And.
19_MELI,That we go by <XX>.
19_FRAN,No no. It's just an elementary school.
19_MELI,To grandma's.
19_FRAN,But then...
19_X,<XX>.
19_FRAN,"Starting from the sun, Then we went about, I think it was th- maybe thirty-seven, you know, sheets to Mercury, Then he says."
19_RON,Mhm.
19_FRAN,"Now the size of Mercury would be, and he had a staple, would be, like this, you know, hole of that through the paper, you know that about that, not... no bigger than that..."
19_RON,Mhm.
19_MELI,Wow.
19_FRAN,"We-... and we got out to Earth, and I think it was a paperclip size, you know, to punch through or something. You know just to kind of give us an idea of."
19_RON,How big was the sun. Did they say.
19_FRAN,It was a softball. He had a softball sitting there.
19_RON,Oh.
19_FRAN,If the sun were this softball.
19_RON,Unhunh.
19_FRAN,"Then the size of these other ones would be, something like that. When we got out to Jupiter..."
19_RON,<XX>.
19_FRAN,"It would have been the size, of the hole in the middle of a record."
19_RON,Hunh.
19_MELI,"That's mighty large, comparatively."
19_RON,"You mean a single r-, a single, or a l-, a large."
19_FRAN,Uh the. Oh gee.
19_MELI,In an LP I'm sure.
19_FRAN,"Yeah, I thought it was just an LP."
19_MELI,"Yeah, because otherwise."
19_FRAN,Well compared to Earth being a staple.
19_RON,Yeah.
19_MELI,"Uh, paperclip."
19_FRAN,"Ho- hole, or paperclip hole."
19_MELI,What was Pluto. Pluto must have been.
19_FRAN,Well I have the i-.
19_RON,Oh.
19_FRAN,I had the information outside.
19_RON,The hole that you just punch with a paperclip.
19_FRAN,I'll have to look. Yeah.
19_RON,Yeah... oh.
19_FRAN,The hole. It would be that kind of diameter.
19_RON,Oh. Wow.
19_MELI,And the diameter of a staple...
19_FRAN,<XX>.
19_RON,Mm. Mhm.
19_FRAN,"For Mercury, yeah..."
19_MELI,my arm's falling asleep.
19_RON,Hm.
19_MELI,My butt fell asleep earlier.
19_FRAN,So it was kind of interesting.
19_MELI,Cause I was sitting here so long...
19_BRET,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,Never had that happen before. Anyway...
19_RON,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,"Ts- your butt falls asleep, you try and stand up."
19_MELI,I have this whole paragraph written...
19_BRET,<XX>.
19_MELI,"And now that I look at it, there's a much better way of uh doing it structurally."
19_FRAN,Just.
19_BRET,Well then redo it.
19_MELI,Because I put this big parenthesy here.
19_BRET,Create stress.
19_MELI,Well what I might as well have done.
19_BRET,Create stress onto yourself.
19_MELI,"Cause see, I have, he awakened at the silence, and he got to hear, this and this and this. And I interrupted with, he awakened at the silence, parenthesy, the author does such a good job of describing this... and everything else. Especially Adam's feelings. And he got to hear, It totally totally breaks the paragraph. And I should have just put this together, and then put, the author does a great job, of describing the silence. And then did that... But I don't have time to rewrite it, do I."
19_FRAN,Maybe it's too distracting here.
19_MELI,No. No.
19_FRAN,And we should go in the living room and.
19_MELI,"No, because I would have done this anyway."
19_JAN,Why don't you and Ron come back into the living room instead.
19_BRET,No.
19_MELI,"Be a rebel, Stay here."
19_BRET,I wanna work on this.
19_FRAN,"Yeah, let's go back out there. That way."
19_MELI,No.
19_FRAN,"Your... you guys can overhear, listen. There are... just, you- go ahead, you're doing alright. What's that, Brett, somebody's head from behind."
19_BRET,Yeah...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_BRET,It's the conductor...
19_FRAN,<NONVERBAL>
19_MELI,"What is this, nice to have you."
19_FRAN,"Could try to draw Vodnoy from behind, get his picture <XX>."
19_BRET,"Yeah like, where am I going to get Vodnoy's picture."
19_FRAN,"I don't know, if it's due tomorrow."
19_MELI,Off of...
19_FRAN,<XX>.
19_BRET,It's not due tomorrow...
19_MELI,<XX>.
19_BRET,"Thank goodness, or else I'd be up till midnight, working on this dumb thing."
19_FRAN,This is quite a picture Melissa had...
19_MELI,<NONVERBAL>
19_RON,Hey Brett...
19_FRAN,<XX>.
19_RON,Can you move your chair.
19_FRAN,The photograph. Ron...
