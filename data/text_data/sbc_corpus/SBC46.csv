46_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,Hey man.
46_DARR,Hey.
46_REED,"Good to see you, well, I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there."
46_DARR,I did...
46_SALL,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,"Well, I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself too bad."
46_DARR,Me too.
46_REED,And she says you're getting better already...
46_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,So that's always a good sign.
46_DARR,"Yeah, I mean I couldn't. I couldn't begin to deal with the slightest pressure."
46_REED,"Yeah, give it easy easy, yeah don't."
46_DARR,That still hurts back here.
46_REED,"Yeah, yeah. Well, you don't want to stretch, see what happened, you st-. Ch-. According to this other guy, you stretched your ligaments in there, and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together, keep it from flopping around so, if they get, you know, stretched just a little, when they try to peel down, and tighten up, and you don't want to, you know, get em too lax while they're trying to tighten. You know, you want to let em heal as strong as they can. I mean you can move it, I'm not saying you got to go around with it just totally, but you don't wanna stretch those ligaments very much when, while they're healing. Just. Just gradually bring it around."
46_DARR,Okay.
46_REED,Are you using any kind of walking aids.
46_DARR,Hm-mm.
46_REED,Nope. Just walking around. Hunh.
46_DARR,"Yeah, I had, for the first two days I had a crutch or two."
46_REED,Okay.
46_DARR,"I switched from two to one, like a cane, and then I."
46_REED,Yeah. Okay.
46_DARR,"Uh, it was really icy there, so I, it had a spike on it, so I."
46_REED,"Oh, that was neat."
46_DARR,Yeah. Peg it in the ground.
46_REED,"If you forget, and walk inside with your spike, I guess you're not too well appreciated..."
46_DARR,No.
46_REED,Bet you.
46_DARR,No.
46_REED,Let me set you up there...
46_DARR,"Is it okay if I record this, I. I already have."
46_REED,Sure.
46_DARR,It's for a project.
46_REED,Sure... Sure.
46_DARR,Cool.
46_REED,"Alright, what are you doing over there. I thought you were doing something different. I thought you were working with languages in."
46_DARR,Oklahoma.
46_REED,Hunh.
46_DARR,Or in California.
46_REED,"I mean, well yeah, y- California your basic project."
46_DARR,I was in linguistics. That's what this project's for.
46_REED,Yeah that's.
46_DARR,"But, I did a year of it, and decided it wasn't quite, what I really l-."
46_REED,"Quite, quite what you want, okay."
46_DARR,"Yeah, it was an unfortunate, cause I really don't know quite what I want."
46_REED,"Well that's alright. I mean, there's a lot of things out there, you'll find something."
46_DARR,I hope so.
46_REED,"You know, uh."
46_DARR,I move to Oklahoma...
46_REED,"<XX>. Completely. My son is still flopping around, he. He uh graduated from medical school this year and uh, I mean he's in uh, Soho in New York."
46_DARR,Really.
46_REED,Starting an art career...
46_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,"So, so you see, I mean, a lot of people, you know, I mean he's gonna paint for a year, and just see whether he can do well enough with that to."
46_DARR,Cause he doesn't want to be a doctor after all.
46_REED,"Well, he couldn't find anything he really wanted to do. You know, I mean he."
46_DARR,Did he specialize at all.
46_REED,"He. Well that's what I mean, no, he hasn't specialized yet. But he couldn't find anything that just really, pulled him toward it, and so he said well, you know, I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and, he's gotta scratch that little itch, I think."
46_DARR,Good for him.
46_REED,"And, so he's up there, and he'll give it a year and, see what happens. And the same for you, you got. You got plenty of. There's uh, fortunately, this day and time I think it allows, uh one to, proceed like you're and-, you're proceeding, and he's proceeding. And I think it, I think it's the right thing to do. I would've d-. I would probably do the same thing were I, you know, another generation down the line. You know, although I r- uh, I didn't make the wrong decision for me. But, I'm sure I would have been a lot more. Uh, uh, I guess, diligent in in, working it out beforehand but, in, in my time, you know, you really kinda just. There wasn't too many things to do, you know, and, you- too many opportunities, and so you just kinda, chose between a few, and, that was it."
46_DARR,Yeah...
46_REED,<NONVERBAL>
46_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,"So, a little simpler lifestyle in those days. Tell me where it hurts."
46_DARR,"Uh, still a little bit back here."
46_REED,Mm-kay.
46_DARR,"Doesn't feel quite normal back there, under."
46_REED,Okay.
46_DARR,It originally hurt.
46_REED,"On the sides, yeah, the sides don't hurt much."
46_DARR,It would. Not anymore. I think it did at fir-.
46_REED,Mm-kay.
46_DARR,At first.
46_REED,Great.
46_DARR,"He drew some blood out, from here the first time."
46_REED,"Yeah, I saw that. You got, a little bit of blood, not too much, that's a good sign too. Cause, usually when they're torn bad, they have a lot more blood than that. Is that doing anything."
46_DARR,Nothing bad really.
46_REED,"Which one hurts more, back, or forward."
46_DARR,They're about the same.
46_REED,About the same.
46_DARR,There's just this sense of constantly not being quite right.
46_REED,"Mm-kay. Well see, let me show you something over here. Watch this one. See I'm pushing back now."
46_DARR,Yeah.
46_REED,"And I'm pulling forward, and it. You get a little bit of pull, coming forward it, it moves out a little bit, and, but when you go back, it kinda, tight. It's got a good catch to it you know."
46_DARR,Mhm.
46_REED,"Over here, we're gonna pull, pull it out."
46_DARR,Wow it doesn't have that same movement.
46_REED,"It's got a little more forward movement, and it, kinda, has a, kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there, so uh, chances are, you've uh hurt that, uh ligament in the back too. Uh."
46_DARR,The crossband.
46_REED,"Mhm yeah. The. Call. We call em the cruciate ligaments. He calls em the ex-bands, or whatever they are."
46_DARR,"Yeah, I don't know what."
46_REED,"Th- they. They cross, and one. They cross because one's going forward and one's going backwards, and they keep you from going forwards and backwards, is basically what they do so."
46_DARR,Hunh.
46_REED,Pretty logical arrangement there.
46_DARR,Mhm...
46_REED,"Yeah, it is. Your posterior's messed up a little bit..."
46_DARR,"Well, can that get better."
46_REED,"Uh, mm, get a little better maybe. It's not gonna get all the way right."
46_DARR,Mm.
46_REED,"It'll be a little bit of a problem. I'm not sure you didn't maybe have some of that before, I don't really know, uh, let me see w- how much this hurts here."
46_DARR,Mm.
46_REED,None.
46_DARR,Mm-mm.
46_REED,Good...
46_DARR,"My main physical activity, for the past year and a half has been aikido..."
46_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
46_DARR,Which is a pretty gentle art.
46_REED,Mm. Mm-kay.
46_DARR,"Lot of rolling, lot of. The knees do take something from that, I believe that they. A lot of work on em."
46_REED,"Oh yeah. Sure. Any of those things gotta put some kinda stress on your leg, you know."
46_DARR,I definitely want to get back to it though. I had to lay off it for a while. That hurts right over here.
46_SALL,Okay.
46_REED,Mm-kay. It's not too bad though...
46_SALL,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,"It's just very mild, uh, that. That one could probably. See look at the difference on here now... what- see. See how much of a jiggle you got there, you got just a little laxity there... right."
46_DARR,Mhm.
46_REED,And this one's just a hair different. I mean it. But it hurts.
46_DARR,A bit.
46_REED,"Uh, a little bit."
46_DARR,It hurt a lot at first.
46_REED,"But it's just a hair, and uh, so, if you just let that one kinda heal, you know, which I think it's gonna do, cause you don't even complain much of this over here. You know, when you're doing things, you're thinking more about this back one, and that's the posterior ex-band, if you want to put it like that, or posterior cruciate we call it..."
46_DARR,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,"Uh, seems to be the problem, but it's not uh, I'm not sure you didn't have a little bit of that problem before."
46_DARR,"It isn't. All these years since the wreck, the the leg's never felt, you know, like it, it's never been totally normal but."
46_REED,Mhm. Mhm.
46_DARR,I just got used to it.
46_REED,"Did your knee, did your knee feel like it would..."
46_DARR,Sorr- that hurts a bit...
46_REED,"<XX>, Where did that get you, over here."
46_DARR,Again yeah.
46_REED,"Right. Yeah okay. That's okay. Did your knee feel like it had some play in it, you know, it wasn't real steady."
46_DARR,I don't remember. That being a.
46_REED,Being a complaint while you were doing your martial arts stuff...
46_SALL,<NONVERBAL>
46_REED,Still hurt a little bit too.
46_DARR,"I injured the front of the knees when I was dancing for a while, I was dancing with Kristy Hannah here, few years ago and."
46_REED,Mhm.
46_DARR,"There were some times I came down on it, and it did some..."
46_REED,<XX>.
46_DARR,But that was impact injury.
46_REED,"Yeah. Right. Let's see how rough that is. Let your knee down. Alright now straighten your knee out. Yeah, you've got a little. Put your."
46_DARR,Yeah.
46_REED,Put your hand. You feel it.
46_DARR,"Yeah, it's <XX>."
46_REED,But that's pretty typical. How about this one. You got anything over here.
46_DARR,I've got a <XX>.
46_REED,No that's pretty slick. Just a little click over there.
46_DARR,Yeah.
46_REED,"Alright. Uh, hold your leg real strong there, let me pull on it. And let's see if we got, a pretty good muscle there. Is that hurting anything."
46_DARR,Mm-mm.
46_REED,"Kay. Alright, well I-. I think uhm, You know I. I think, probably, it's mostly posterior cruciate, not so much anterior cruciate, which is good, um, the medial collateral ligament, that ligament here is just minimally hurt, uh, I think some of that posterior cruciate was probably already r- there, and the reason I'm saying that is, because it really doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it. See the. This is the one that pulls on that."
46_DARR,It feels tight though a bit.
46_REED,"Mhm. When I push back, I'm pushing on it. That's. And, and that's not bothering you very much. But see this one, has been hurt, and when I pull on this one."
46_DARR,That does hurt.
46_REED,"Y- it it hurts. So, I mean, you know, I mean, pretty simple, you know, if if they've been hurt, they gonna hurt when you stretch em... you know, so, that's why I'm thinking that posterior is probably, a lot of that's been there, you may have hurt it a little bit more, you know, and y-. So you got this one a little bit, and this one a little bit, Both of em are a little, both of em can probably heal up if you let em, and."
46_DARR,No need for surgery to make it better.
46_REED,"No. Unh-unh. And uh, the, the outcome will probably be, pretty close to what you had before. In other words, I."
46_DARR,"I may have lost a bit, but it's not."
46_REED,"Yeah. I mean, you know, five percent or, something. You know what I mean, you know, I don't know. You know, you'll just have to. Try to have to see how it plays out. But it it's gonna be minimal. And you can z-. You can overcome that a little bit, by getting your muscle in better shape. There are two things that stabilize your knee. This is your knee brace, the big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee, that's what holds it together when you're doing things. In fact, you know, all the sports players they. Their ligaments have been stretched so much and, repaired, and stretched, and repaired, that they. They're just not much good, and they really have to compensate with their muscle power, is what they do."
46_DARR,They do a lot of leg lifts.
46_REED,"So right. Uh, you know just, just, uh, you can do straight leg lifts, or what we call just those little short extensions, just put a bolster under behind your leg right here, extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg, like this, do little short extensions with weight."
46_DARR,Mhm.
46_REED,And keep working up on the weight.
46_DARR,Mhm.
46_REED,"You wanna b-. You. What you wanna do, and you can just do isometrics, you can just lock your knee real stiff, and just tighten your muscle, hold it tight as you can for three seconds, and then let it rest for three seconds, and then tight for three seconds, and then rest. And you don't have to move it when you do that. Uh, uh all kinda ways. So just whatever the day will al- permit, I mean, if you're sitting around, and you got some time to do some isometrics, you can do that, and then when you have other time you can do the weights. But keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the plan. You know so uh, you know, I think, I think you'll find you, you do pretty well."
46_DARR,Do you think I can go back to aikido and stuff.
46_REED,"Probably, as long as it's not too too violent. You know it's more form and, shape and, stuff or it's, it's not too much contact."
46_DARR,It's about...
46_REED,<NONVERBAL>
46_DARR,"But no it's, ideally it's about blending. It's about blending with the attack, it's not about meeting the force with force so."
46_REED,Okay.
46_DARR,There's a lot of rolls.
46_REED,"Okay, mm, well, I guess if you got good at at doing it, you know, where you didn't. Wasn't getting yourself in awkward positions, and you know, getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something, you know, you could probably handle it okay. I think, I think you'll you'll be able to see for yourself. Because once you get your muscles strong, you get this thing controlling your knee well, you'll see what kind of knee control you have, it'll be pretty obvious to you whether you you have the type of control to do that."
46_DARR,"What do you think the lesson should be from this. I mean, uh. This is the first time I've ever been on skis. I never did it before my wreck, so, I guess the less. W- one lesson is I'll probably shouldn't try skiing anymore..."
46_REED,<NONVERBAL>
46_DARR,I uh.
46_REED,"He-... uh. You know, if it were me personally, that would probably be the lesson I'd learn from it."
46_DARR,Cause I'm lucky it wasn't worse. When I.
46_REED,Right.
46_DARR,It was a pretty bad fall.
46_REED,Right.
46_DARR,"The. The incline was about, I don't know what grade but, there was a turn in the wood-. It was this was in the woods."
46_REED,Yeah right.
46_DARR,And it was cross country.
46_REED,Yeah.
46_DARR,"So I didn't know what I was doing, my girlfriend had taught me, I had been skiing for two and a half hours, I was tired..."
46_REED,<NONVERBAL>
46_DARR,"And we were getting close to getting back, and I got uh carried away. She showed me how when you're. In cross country, when you're about to fall, you just sit down."
46_REED,Oh. Okay.
46_DARR,"But I didn't do it right. So, there was a turn and then, I. And the skis don't snap off of course."
46_REED,Oh. I know.
46_DARR,"And so, it stuck, and I kept twisting."
46_REED,You.
46_DARR,And the knee took all the torque.
46_REED,Oh.
46_DARR,"And I didn't know what I'd done. I screamed and, she helped me, and I manage to somehow, I don't know uh. S- somehow managed to get up and, hobble on the ski pole, all the way back to the cabin."
46_REED,Oh my God.
46_DARR,"And then we had to call the uh, s- the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to Oreille, which is a ski resort."
46_REED,Geez.
46_DARR,We were in the middle of nowhere...
46_REED,Hunh.
46_DARR,"I'm a little. I I think it's been three weeks now, I. I was hoping that, you know, you told me or, doctor Smith told me that you know, with chronic osteo it could come back from impact, and I was. And I really hope this is not the time, you know, I've made it how many."
46_REED,Ah that's unlikely.
46_DARR,"I've. I have not spiked any fever or, or seen any signs of."
46_REED,"Yeah. No it's, it looks pretty good."
46_DARR,I think I may have gotten lucky.
46_REED,"Yeah, if it's not hurting up there, the pain would be probably your first warning sign. And you know."
46_DARR,If that ever happened.
46_REED,"Right. You could start feeling some change in the the status quo, you know. Changes."
46_DARR,I still feel.
46_REED,Yeah.
46_DARR,It feels b- pretty much like the other leg. I mean.
46_REED,Good. That's great. Wonderful.
46_DARR,Solid.
46_REED,Great.
46_DARR,Well.
46_REED,"Love it. Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself, it's a cheap lesson. Right."
46_DARR,That's right...
46_REED,<NONVERBAL>
46_SALL,<NONVERBAL>
46_DARR,I'd say so.
46_REED,"Yeah, I. I was out. We were out, and the kids were skiing, you know, and I was watching em go down, and I was thinking, God that would sure be fun. You know. And then s-, just barely my common sense won out, and I decided not to do it, but you know I've had two discs taken out of my back, my neck fused for a bad disc, I don't need to go flumpity-bump down the hill. You know, I don't need any of that, so, you just have to, have to kind of draw a few lines."
46_DARR,Mm.
46_REED,But I came close to.
46_DARR,It's tempting.
46_REED,"To trying it, it's tempting. It's very tempting."
46_DARR,"It was fun, I can tell you, till I fell."
46_REED,"Oh God. It's. It's just great. You know, but, then I'd have to pay for it for the rest of my life, but I didn't know whether I wanted to do that."
46_DARR,Not a fair trade...
46_REED,Not a fair trade.
46_SALL,No.
46_DARR,I wouldn't do it.
46_REED,Ch-.
46_DARR,That's bad odds.
46_REED,Good to see you. Come see me. You know whenever you're in town.
46_DARR,I will.
46_REED,"And uh, let me know what you get into, I'm sure it'll be something fun."
46_DARR,I hope so.
46_REED,I think it will. See you.
46_DARR,Bye-bye.
46_REED,Okay.
46_SALL,"Okay. Just let us know, if you need anything."
46_DARR,Okay.
46_SALL,<NONVERBAL>
