49_LUCY,Uh I think they finished the painting.

49_LUCY,This is the guy that we thought had one outfit Annette...
49_JOHN,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"John likes it, gives it character..."
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"For three years, until you looked in his suitcase."
49_JOHN,Yeah.
49_DAN,Gives the pants character...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>

49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"You can't talk, if you're not gonna sign my form."
49_ANNE,Oh.
49_LUCY,"Geez, I remember a time when."
49_JOHN,"I tell you, I feel better already."
49_LUCY,John's shirts were all cranberry.
49_JOHN,"Just listening to those guys, putting those windows in in one afternoon..."
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_ANNE,And his socks all had double stripes.
49_JOHN,"I say, better them than me."
49_LUCY,I know it.
49_AL,I know that feeling.
49_LUCY,Oh.
49_JOHN,Yigads.
49_LUCY,But they paint-.
49_ALLE,That's like anything.
49_LUCY,They painted the inside the wrong color. We had ordered this.
49_LIND,Well you got it on John.
49_LUCY,Um.
49_ALLE,Well...
49_JOHN,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,Like an eggshell color. Be-.
49_JOHN,Thank you Linda.
49_LUCY,The color that we had the woodwork in the dining room...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,Similar to that.
49_AL,That's good.
49_LUCY,Was on their list of colors you could use...
49_AL,"<XX>, hm."
49_LUCY,So that's the color...
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,We h-...
49_AL,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,Wanted them to paint the inside trim of the new door they put on. The... the h-. Casement and the trim...
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"But they'd brought the wrong color paint, so they painted it white the first day..."
49_X,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"And the guy. Pat said he came in, he had been at unemployment, when he came back, he said, the guy said to him, oh my God, we painted it the wrong color. I just realized it. Don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow. They came back the next day, put two more coats of paint on, the right color..."
49_JOHN,Mm.
49_ANNE,Good workers.
49_LUCY,But they stained the doors.
49_ALLE,Yeah but the longer they're there.
49_LUCY,"And polyurethaned them, and every-."
49_AL,So what did they do-.
49_ALLE,"You gotta realize, the longer they're there, the longer their job'll last."
49_LUCY,"Well-, no, but they... it's done-... it's a money basis. They get paid, It's it's a."
49_DAN,They get paid per job.
49_LUCY,"It was a contract bid, so they get paid per job."
49_ALLE,"Yeah, but I imagine, I imagine they also have a little thing called cost plus."
49_LUCY,"Oh, well probably."
49_JOHN,Yeah.
49_LUCY,"They probably do. But, yeah."
49_ALLE,"They don't do anything for the government, unless it's cost plus."
49_LUCY,"No. But when you c-. I was telling John, I just did an ad for The Patriot. Yesterday when I was in work. Nine-hundred thousand dollars, for thirty-four residences. In East Boston and Revere. So our contract was similar. So it's it's an average of fifty thousand."
49_AL,Yeah.
49_LUCY,"You know, between f- thirty and fifty thousand. Depending on how much they do in each house. Like some people didn't want the rooms done. We figured, our living room was so big, why not take advantage, and have them put new walls."
49_AL,Oh sure.
49_LUCY,You know.
49_AL,Might as well get everything...
49_JOHN,<XX> fifty thousand...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_AL,Might as well not take everything they're willing to give you.
49_LUCY,Yeah. That's right. That's that's what we said.
49_JOHN,Gotta.
49_LUCY,So.
49_DAN,"And also, the ceiling fell down already. So."
49_LUCY,"Well, but they didn't do the ceiling, unfortunately, because it's not on a top floor."
49_DAN,Are they gonna replace that.
49_LUCY,No.
49_DAN,That doesn't go with doing over the room. The ceiling isn't considered part of the living room.
49_LUCY,"No. O- no, Only if, that room, is on the top level of the house."
49_ANNE,What did you drop...
49_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"If it's on the top level of the house, they would, because they needed to soundproof it."
49_LIND,"Al, there's nobody... oh the girls are in there."
49_LUCY,But there's two levels above. So they didn't have to. Unfortunately.
49_ANNE,Hunh.
49_AL,So what time. I'm curious now. What did they do to the walls.
49_LUCY,"Oh, wait till you see what they did in the living room. When-... when we get the walls painted and everything, you'll all have to come over. And just see."
49_AL,Oh is the room smaller or something now. Did they.
49_LUCY,"They went in five inches, on the two outside walls. They put in... they studded the outside walls, from the inside. You know, the inside of the room. Um, and then they put insulation, and then they put soundproof boards. Then they put two layers, of three-quarter-inch drywall. And then they taped it all, and skim coated it. It's beautiful."
49_AL,Oh they skim coated it too.
49_LUCY,Yep.
49_AL,They didn't just tape it.
49_LUCY,Yeah-.
49_AL,Oh.
49_LUCY,"And then they put a primer coat of paint on it. So all we have to do is go in and paint it. They put new woodwork along the bottom, and all new woodwork around the windows. Danny and I got crap woodwork. Ev-. All the room-... windows had to have woodwork for them to, So, that room out back, that used to be a porch."
49_AL,Mhm.
49_LUCY,"Danny and I put wallboard up, and then we got this garbage trim. That was on sale for three ninety-five. They replaced it with the stuff that was thirteen ninety- five."
49_ANNE,Mm.
49_DAN,Yeah...
49_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,Had to put the. You had to go through the aggravation.
49_LUCY,Uh Of putting it up.
49_DAN,Spending the money on this trash.
49_LUCY,"It had to be there, before they would replace."
49_DAN,"Putting the trim up, before they would work on it."
49_LUCY,Mm.
49_JOHN,Come in and tear it down and replace it.
49_LUCY,"Although, did I tell you that guy that put the hole."
49_DAN,Just to get an.
49_LUCY,Remember the guy that put the hole...
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"In the back of his house, because he decided he'd like a picture window in his kitchen..."
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,And they wouldn't replace it...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,They did.
49_DAN,Cause there were. Oh they did.
49_LUCY,"Yes, he threatened to take them to court."
49_DAN,Oh I thought they told him.
49_LUCY,So they repla-... they put in.
49_DAN,"They told... didn't they originally tell him, he had to put a-."
49_LUCY,Yeah.
49_DAN,He had to put a window in.
49_LIND,Uh.
49_LUCY,"Well that was the guy, that used to live around the corner..."
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,From mom and dad.
49_DAVE,Now how much the Patriots losing by.
49_LUCY,That died. He died right after they put the window in.
49_AL,It was almost seventeen in the fourth.
49_ANNE,Well that'll teach him.
49_X,Are they winning...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_AL,No they're losing.
49_ALLE,Is that plugged in yet.
49_AL,Buffalo was driving em.
49_ALLE,Or what.
49_DAVE,Of course they're losing.
49_LUCY,You might-. Oh. Well well. You know the. You know who I mean. The guy that used to live around the corner...
49_DAVE,<XX> <XX> <XX>.
49_LUCY,"That during bussing, had the illiterate spelt wrong on the side of his house."
49_DAN,"Oh yeah yeah, the Italian guy that l-. You mean the guy that lived in Charlestown."
49_LUCY,Yes. Yeah.
49_DAVE,"You can watch <XX>, <XX>."
49_LUCY,He moved down near me.
49_AL,That was intentional though Lucy...
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"Yeah, that was a, that was a gag."
49_AL,Having illiterate spelled.
49_LUCY,No. I don't think he did...
49_AL,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,He didn't know how to spell it.
49_ANNE,Mm.
49_LUCY,That was.
49_DAVE,Jane...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,Well it was close. But it was a gag...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,He probably didn't know himself.
49_LUCY,No. I'm sure he didn't.
49_DAN,He went and looked it up in the dictionary...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,So that he could spell it wrong on purpose...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_AL,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,Yeah. But the windows Al. Are...
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_ANNE,Al is smoking.
49_LUCY,"This, this wide now. They're, the living room windows. It's two complete windows. They have, And, all of the windows are four sheets of glass thick. There are two levels, on the top, and two levels on the bottom. With, double glass. So, I have to open, in every room I have to open at least two windows. To get to the screen. And the screen is full-level, from the top to the bottom of the window."
49_AL,Mhm.
49_LUCY,They're really nice...
49_DAN,<XX> <XX> <XX>.
49_LUCY,Unfortunately.
49_ANNE,So how is that for washing your windows.
49_LUCY,We're three years too late.
49_LIND,Did you leave it over there.
49_LUCY,You can pull.
49_LIND,Cause I just brought this one down.
49_LUCY,They...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,Each panel comes out.
49_ANNE,"Oh, nice."
49_LUCY,And you wash them from the inside.
49_AL,Oh they <XX> <XX> <XX>.
49_LUCY,Three years ago they put central air conditioning. But they stopped that. Because the federal government decided that it was...
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_ANNE,Extravagant use of money.
49_JOHN,Oh man.
49_LUCY,Cost prohibitive.
49_JOHN,Too bad they. C- oh. Oh God.
49_LUCY,They did it in.
49_JOHN,Too bad you couldn't've got in on that.
49_LUCY,Connecticut. Connecticut and Rhode Island got the central air conditioning.
49_JOHN,Ah.
49_LUCY,"But they didn't, They."
49_ANNE,That's good for about three grand.
49_LUCY,Yeah... they stopped it by the time.
49_ALLE,Could you move your house over there John.
49_LUCY,They got up here.
49_ALLE,And have the planes go over.
49_LUCY,I know.
49_JOHN,Yeah...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_JOHN,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,You know actually though...
49_ALLE,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,You can still hear the planes.
49_JOHN,We may. I was just gonna ask you.
49_LUCY,"I mean it's not, It. S-. Sabina said, she had hers done last fall..."
49_X,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"And she said, she could notice, a big difference in the winter. But in the summer, when you have your windows open anyway."
49_JOHN,Oh yeah.
49_LUCY,It really doesn't make any difference for her.
49_AL,Well that's why you should've made a case for the air conditioning.
49_JOHN,That's right.
49_AL,You know I wouldn't have to open my windows.
49_JOHN,Yeah.
49_LUCY,I know...
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"But that, that was what the d-, the guy that came, the first day from Mass Port said... boy, unfortunately, you're a couple of years too late for the air conditioning."
49_JOHN,"Ah, that would be beautiful..."
49_DAN,<XX>...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,How much complaining can you do. What did they spend on your house.
49_LUCY,Oh it had.
49_DAN,Probably twenty-five thousand.
49_LUCY,It has to. Oh more than that Dan.
49_DAN,Thirty-five thousand.
49_JOHN,More.
49_LUCY,More than that.
49_DAN,Like I said... uh Just give me the money and.
49_LUCY,Mhm.
49_DAN,"You can have the house... We'll start somewhere else. It is a really strange regulation though. Um, did all this work, just so they could."
49_JOHN,Come in and tear it down.
49_LUCY,So that you can't s-.
49_DAN,"Come, tear it down."
49_LUCY,I know.
49_DAN,And get in the carpenters' way.
49_LUCY,But they. You sign a contract.
49_DAN,Really.
49_LUCY,That you can't sue them for noise pollution. For at least twenty years after the work is completed.
49_DAN,But since. But for them it's uh...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"You know, for the workers themselves it's like."
49_ANNE,Hunh.
49_DAN,"The room was b-. The room didn't even have anything up John. There was no, No walls, nothing."
49_LUCY,We put the walls up.
49_DAN,"They could've just p opped them, Yeah."
49_JOHN,Yeah.
49_DAN,They could've just popped the windows out. Without any trouble.
49_LUCY,Hm.
49_DAN,"Put the windows back, put the new windows in."
49_LUCY,Yeah.
49_DAN,They had to come in and tear stuff down.
49_LUCY,"Yeah. And of course, the stuff that we put up, wasn't first quality, because, w- why would we spend the money."
49_JOHN,Yeah.
49_LUCY,"If they're gonna replace it if they crack it, so everything they touched."
49_ALLE,Did they take the woodwork down.
49_DAN,We made sure we used stuff that they'd crack.
49_ALLE,That Danny put in your k itchen.
49_LUCY,"Yes, they put up stuff that was worth three times the money."
49_ALLE,And they told you to f-... you had to do that.
49_LUCY,"Well, it had to be existing. In order for them to replace it."
49_ALLE,Oh.
49_DAN,We had to finish that whole second-floor room.
49_LUCY,"They had to bring out whatev-. You know, the. It was like a tradeoff."
49_ALLE,Ah.
49_AL,What did they do upstairs Lucy. Anything.
49_LUCY,"Um, well, in the, you know the r-. There's a room off my bedroom. That used to be a porch. That Danny and I put the walls in."
49_AL,Mhm.
49_DAN,That Joe built.
49_LUCY,"And then we put a cei-. You know, it was the r-..."
49_AL,<NONVERBAL>
49_ANNE,The room that Joe built.
49_LUCY,House that Joe built.
49_DAN,With everything in sideways...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_JOHN,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,All the windows were sideways...
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,They.
49_LIND,Hunh.
49_LUCY,"We went in, and we just threw up wood, to straighten everything out, and put woodwork on. They came in and they said, while we were working on it..."
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,"They said, oh well gee, you really need two sheets of sheetrock. At least, for insula-... for soundproof insulation. If you don't feel like putting it up, we'll put it up when we come in. So we decided."
49_AL,Not to bother.
49_LUCY,"Hey, let them do it."
49_AL,Why bother. Let them deal with it...
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_JOHN,Mm.
49_LUCY,You know.
49_DAN,Well we put one ceiling up.
49_AL,Sure.
49_LUCY,We put one up. But they put the second one.
49_DAN,Uh And they require you have a f-...
49_X,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,And they put the stuff in between.
49_DAN,You had to have it fini-. Well you had to have it finished anyway. For them to tear it down.
49_LUCY,Well then we put.
49_DAN,But they were gonna put in the.
49_LUCY,"We put the baseboard heat. We put electric baseboard heat in. Um, because it had to be a heated room. But they put all new windows in, and we put up the junk woodwork, and they put up."
49_DAN,That was a.
49_AL,Hm.
49_DAN,"It was great working in that room, We. We'd make these measurements. Like, you had to measure..."
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,You put up a piece of plas-.
49_LUCY,Uh.
49_DAN,Plasterboard. You'd have to measure like.
49_ALLE,How about.
49_DAN,"Every two feet along, So they."
49_LUCY,Because they had varied so much.
49_DAN,You know it'd go from like.
49_LUCY,It's just...
49_X,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,Eight feet long in one spot...
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"To like, seven feet six inches over here or something."
49_LUCY,"But y-. But that wasn't bad, when you consider that Joe used old doors..."
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_LUCY,That he found in garbage buckets...
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>

49_LUCY,I know it.
49_DAN,I was out on their porch <XX>.
49_LUCY,Did Johny didn't have the French doors though. The French doors are gorgeous.
49_DAN,He had doors put on the back.
49_LUCY,He had the sliders.
49_DAN,Yeah. He had sliders put on the din-.
49_LUCY,"But these are inside French doors, that they put on the living room. You know that archway between the living room and the dining room-. And the um..."
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>

49_LUCY,Yeah.
49_DAN,"Replaced that stuff, they replaced em with was like, five-thousand dollar door or something."
49_LUCY,Yeah.
49_DAN,That was what Johny said they're asking for.
49_LUCY,"Yeah, Because the insulation is unbelievable in them."
49_DAN,Three panes of glass.
49_LUCY,Yeah.
49_DAN,Fifteen-pound brass handles on them <XX>.
49_LUCY,"Mhm, Now they use all brass, they put a uh. Our front door has two locks now. It has the, the one like we had, the deadbolt. And then it has the knob lock. But it's, y- you use the same key for both of them. And that's all brass. They put all brass fixtures on the, French doors in the living room."
49_DAN,Those aren't even going anywhere.
49_LUCY,No. I know.
49_DAN,"Did they make you put a door to the, they put a door on the, room going into the dining room."
49_LUCY,"No, they didn't need one there."
49_DAN,So it wouldn't <XX> <XX>.
49_ALLE,When you go to work.
49_LUCY,"They said, because it was an inside wall."
49_ALLE,"Drop the pants off at the house, and I'll wash them John..."
49_JOHN,<NONVERBAL>
49_ANNE,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"Yeah but, doesn't that uh."

49_ALLE,<XX>.
49_JOHN,"Throw some, Shout on there..."
49_LIND,<NONVERBAL>
49_DAN,"Doesn't the noise come in from the room, from the dining room."
49_LUCY,"I don't know. I'm. I'm not gonna complain. You know, How can I complain."
49_DAN,"Now all we need to do is, something to make that roof stop leaking."
49_LUCY,Leak stop.
49_JOHN,H-. You have oil heat in your house.
49_LUCY,Forced hot air. Yeah.
49_JOHN,Forced hot air.
49_LUCY,So the air conditioning would have been a breeze for them to put in.
49_JOHN,"I know, it would have been a breeze for them..."
49_LUCY,<NONVERBAL>
49_JOHN,Yeah. Just throw in a unit outside.
49_LUCY,Yep.
49_JOHN,"Three-ton unit, or what are they called."

49_JOHN,Oh yeah.
49_DAN,"And it was like a thirteen to ten thriller, with a lot of running, Canadian fans just, went away in droves. So like five-thousand people showed up for it, they were bored, the way that it's played."
49_JOHN,"Yeah. Once you get used to Canadian football. I would imagine you'd, it would be tough to f-. Be like watching soccer."
49_LIND,Those clouds would move...

49_DAN,Yeah. I had the whole mouth done that. That's a real fun feeling.
49_JOHN,"And um, it went in six millimeters..."
49_DAN,<NONVERBAL>
49_JOHN,"To right down in there, he says this, gum is breaking down. But his analysis is, I've got a crown here. And the tooth under the crown, that's that's, whatever's left of it, is c-. I must've cracked it."
