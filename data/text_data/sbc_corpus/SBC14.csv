14_FRED,"Okay. One large loan, renewed, a hundred ninety-seven thousand, a hundred eighty dollars. It's on Gerald and Pamela."
14_JIM,Okay.
14_FRED,"They've paid, they've reduced, no problem. He's handled his line of credit as agreed, so it's pretty routine. Joe."
14_JOE,"Okay. First loan request I have, is an existing real estate mortgage, that will be refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae. Customer is Gerry and Pamela Tucker, at sixty-one fifty-eight Main Street, in Hillsdale Illinois, they're requesting eighty-four thousand dollars, on a thirty-year Fannie Mae fixed rate loan, this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal, title work, and points."
14_FRED,Eighty-four.
14_JOE,"Eighty four even... Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance, would be seven sixty-one eighty-nine, based at the current thirty-year rate. They estimate the value of their home to be, one-hundred and ten thousand dollars. We had an appraisal in nineteen ninety-one, by a certified appraiser, that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars. Eighty percent of that would make it eighty-two four. So, um, in order to make them a loan for eighty-four thousand, it must appraise for a hundred and five. So that will be, will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty-four, and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket. Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen, their liabilities eighty three, their net worth thirty-one."
14_FRED,So all they owe is the house...
14_JOE,Mhm. They um.
14_FRED,T T T.
14_JOE,"Currently have a debt to income of twenty-eight over twenty-seven, and after the refinance, they would have a debt to income of fifteen over twenty-three..."
14_JIM,"Where are they now, I missed that. They're fifteen over."
14_JOE,No. They're currently twenty.
14_FRED,They can't be.
14_JOE,Ove r twenty-seven. I-.
14_FRED,"Oh, okay. Twenty."
14_JOE,Yeah. Twenty over twenty-seven. Yeah.
14_FRED,You can't even.
14_JOE,Twenty over tw-...
14_KURT,<XX>.
14_FRED,You can't even read your writing.
14_JOE,I couldn't even read my f-... my own writing...
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JOE,It's twenty over twenty-seven.
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JOE,And after the refi it's fifteen over twenty-three.
14_KURT,"What is acceptable pretty much, uh, what figures."
14_JOE,Twenty-eight over thirty-six is the maxes.
14_KURT,It's as high as it could go.
14_JOE,"See, so they're well within."
14_KURT,Okay. I just wondered.
14_JOE,They're well within their debt to income.
14_KURT,"I always heard the figures, and never did know what was high, and."
14_JOE,Right.
14_KURT,Low don't make any difference.
14_JOE,Yeah. Um.
14_FRED,So you said they're gonna be fifteen.
14_JOE,"Mhm. Fifteen over twenty-three so, their debt to income isn't a problem, the, uh, problem as I see it is, the value of the house, number one, and the second matter at hand is, that, in nineteen eighty-seven, they had filed a chapter eleven. They had at the time a mortgage with us, They reaffirmed on that mortgage, They were never late, We, uh, After that discharge, we even advanced them money to purchase this house, on Main st- Street here in Hillsdale, and um, they have never missed a payment on that loan, I've also made them car loans, that they've never missed a payment on, and um, according to Fannie Mae guidelines, as long as they have been discharged, at least two years, and reestablished and paid as agreed, their credit obligations, they would qualify for a Fannie Mae mortgage. With that in mind, um, I am moving, that they app-... uh, that we approve this loan request, subject to a uh certified appraisal of their home."
14_FRED,Do we have the discharge.
14_JOE,Yes. I have a copy of it.
14_FRED,Mhm. When was it.
14_JOE,"It was discharged on, November, uh no. Two twenty-three eighty-eight. Discharge date was two twenty-three of eighty-eight."
14_FRED,When did they file. Didn't you say they filed in eighty-seven.
14_JOE,Eleven of eighty-seven.
14_FRED,In eleven.
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_JIM,Three months. Whew. That's pretty fast.
14_JOE,Yeah.
14_FRED,What did they do...
14_JOE,<NONVERBAL>
14_FRED,Dismiss it.
14_JOE,"It was a business. No, it was a business, uh, bankruptcy, and, it was pretty cut and dried, they just were eliminating the business, um, debt, and apparently nobody objected to the, the bankruptcy. Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors. All the debt that was charged-... that was bank- filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors."
14_FRED,"And they discharged em, before they even performed, or anything."
14_JOE,"Yeah, in a three mon-. I guess so, in a p- three-month period of time, cause here's the."
14_FRED,"No I. I just, it's unusual that they don't require em to... you know, usually they put em on a two-year or three-year plan or something."
14_JOE,"Mhm, See, the- from what I uh I gathered is the, unsecured creditors got nothing, and the secured creditors, just carried on their payment history as agreed. As originally set forth in their contracts."
14_FRED,But you know usually the plan'll provide some period of time of protection.
14_JOE,Oh I. Yeah. Mhm.
14_FRED,But if we've got uh.
14_JOE,For those unsecured creditors.
14_FRED,Yeah. But if we've got the discharge.
14_JIM,Yeah.
14_FRED,"Okay. Well, in that case."
14_JIM,"That's hard to believe, because it says that, notice of joint... discharge of joint debtors, it... it appears the persons named above, filed a petition, commencing."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JIM,Joint case under title eleven.
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_JIM,"On November twenty-third, of nineteen eighty-seven. And that an order of relief has been entered, no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed, within the time fixed by the court."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JOE,Yeah.
14_JIM,"Uh, what was that. Ten minutes. Or..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_KURT,<NONVERBAL>
14_JOE,Yeah.
14_JIM,And um.
14_FRED,Yeah. See I don't know how they got it done that fast.
14_JIM,"And, and that they're um."
14_FRED,Hell we can't even get to court in three months.
14_JOE,I know...
14_KURT,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,Hm...
14_KURT,<NONVERBAL>
14_JOE,That's ridiculous.
14_JIM,That.
14_JOE,I have a lean.
14_JIM,"And it's dated February twenty-third, nineteen eighty-eight."
14_JOE,Mhm...
14_JIM,<NONVERBAL>
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,That's uh.
14_FRED,I mean.
14_JIM,Three months.
14_FRED,"That's all. I just. Yeah. That's what I was just. I assumed it would've been, like eighty... uh ninety-two or something."
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_FRED,You know.
14_JIM,Yeah. What.
14_FRED,The five.
14_JIM,"What actually happened to them, was, she opened a franchise. And it was, a franchise of doing packaging, sending m-, uh, from a mall basis."
14_FRED,Unhunh.
14_JIM,"Uh, packaging, gift wrapping, and shipping."
14_KURT,Shipping it...
14_JOE,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"Well, what happened..."
14_JOE,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"They should have gotten into the business, hindsight's twenty twenty, They should've gotten into the business in let's say August, and then they would've had a Christmas season. There was a t-. It got to be real complicated, and they didn't get in until February. Well February they had nothing to do and, and I think they."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JIM,They hung in there for a year and a half. And they just couldn't... couldn't see end to it...
14_FRED,<XX>.
14_KURT,February nobody's shipping anything...
14_FRED,I'll s-. I'll second then Joe...
14_KURT,<NONVERBAL>
14_JOE,Okay.
14_JIM,So it's moved and seconded to uh.
14_JOE,"Approve that loan subject to the, uh, appraisal by a certified appraisal."
14_FRED,And the max is eighty-four.
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,Okay. All in favor aye.
14_FRED,Aye.
14_KURT,Aye.
14_JOE,Aye.
14_JIM,Opposed same sign. Motion carries...
14_FRED,Is that the only one.
14_JOE,That's the only loan I have.
14_FRED,"Okay. I got one small one. The only reason it's in here, is because the borrowers already have, three-hundred three thousand borrowed, so it has to be approved by the board, but if we, if Jim and Kurt approve it today, that'd be two, and then I'll have to call two more. Uh, they wanna borrow forty f-. Well, Dave wants to borrow forty-five hundred dollars to, finish paying off the renovation, and upgrade necessary on the daycare. And, he had initially thought what he borrowed would do it, and then he borrowed some money from his uncle, and he wants to repay his uncle and get that out of the way. He wants to set it up on a year, uh, it would be secured via three vehicles, um, you know his debt to income is relatively high, but his income's going up, the daycare is scheduled to open a week after the fifth. So around the twelfth to fifteenth of January, he thought he's been... he thought he was already opened, and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open. Cause there was articles in the paper, and they showed kids at the daycare and, he had his ads out and everything, but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed, and state came back in and said, well, no, you can't really do that. So, one group of state people, the people that do all the... do the testing for, electrical and safety and stuff have been there, and now the state inspector's got to come in, I guess they just look at the quality of the facility. Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating, but, is it clean, and is it safe, and that sort of thing. They're supposed to be there the fifth, and he said, that the lady told him, that it usually takes a week, for them to send a report in, and for their license to come back. So, he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth, he gave me some numbers, I can't remember, they've got like, thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of, mostly out of their house, until they can get em moved down there, and then they've got eight or nine more. So they fully expect income to exceed the projection, but right now they don't have any income, other than from his job. So, uh, <XX>."
14_JIM,That's fairly large scale. What. And he's gonna have twenty-five people.
14_JOE,The building is.
14_JIM,Or something.
14_JOE,Yeah. At l east twenty-five children.
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JIM,Twenty-five.
14_FRED,"See they're e-. Yeah. They're expecting that many fairly quickly. And then, he hopes to get up around fifty. See they're looking at four people, plus."
14_JOE,I've gone through the building.
14_FRED,"You know, plus his wife."
14_JOE,"And it is uh, a r- very very nicely done operation. I mean there's nothing shoddy about the workmanship, or the quality of the material, or the cleanliness of the, of the building... <XX>."
14_JIM,Is it attached onto a storage facility.
14_JOE,No. It's a separate building.
14_JIM,Oh it's free-standing building.
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JOE,Separate building.
14_FRED,See it's a.
14_JIM,They.
14_FRED,"It's a building his dad had, where he was... where he had his."
14_JOE,His cabinet shop.
14_JIM,Okay.
14_FRED,"Shop, and."
14_JIM,Okay.
14_FRED,"And was living in it, and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing. It's like anything, when you're dealing with th-... you know, regulators and the state, they, you know, he said they got two ladies for nine counties, and they. There's a lot of this going on, and they can only get to so many. So, I would move, since it's secured for forty-five hundred, it's on a twelve-month repayment, which is relatively short, I would move that we advance the funds."
14_KURT,"I'll second it. Except, they owe pretty much, don't they."
14_FRED,"Three-hundred three thousand, and some odd dollars. But he's always serviced, I mean, he's never been late, he's always paid as agreed, uh, and they do have the income, it just, right now, the income doesn't. Well, I say they have it. Once the daycare gets up to twenty people, they'll have enough income to."
14_KURT,Mhm.
14_FRED,"They'll fall back under the forty percent, But right now they're over the forty, because we st- can't show any income from the daycare. Um, but, you know, it it... you know, I feel comfortable that it's there, and like I say, he's always serviced debt as agreed, and, and his overall debt is working down, it's just quite a bit of debt."
14_KURT,"You just, I guess you can't say too much if they're paying on time. Uh uh."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_KURT,And.
14_FRED,And I think they're about to the point.
14_KURT,As long as everything works out good...
14_JOE,<NONVERBAL>
14_KURT,<NONVERBAL>
14_FRED,"Yeah, I think if th-... you know, th- th-. He's already talking, if this thing goes like they think it is, next fall he's wanting to, start looking at expanding that storage facility. It's one of those things, I think there's... they're always gonna have quite a bit of debt, so long as cash flow'll keep up with it. Cause, you know he's... that's kind of their, you know he's looking at that as his retirement income, and an investment, and this whole bit, you know, like some of the people do here."
14_JIM,"Uh Well it's been moved and seconded, um, to approve, but that, uh we can't really disburse on that. That, due to his size, of the loan."
14_JOE,Until we have all.
14_JIM,They need f- f-.
14_KURT,All the board members.
14_JOE,Majority of board member.
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JIM,"Four... uh f-. At least two more board members, because I'm voting."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JIM,All in. I'm voting in favor of it.
14_FRED,In favor.
14_JIM,And.
14_FRED,Yeah. See I was.
14_JIM,"Since you seconded it, I assume so are you."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_KURT,Yeah.
14_FRED,"So see I've got two... and then I'll try to, I'll get hold of two more. I was gonna see Wilbur, but he didn't... s- Dave didn't get in here until, after he was gone, so, that's the only one I have."
14_JIM,Any other loans.
14_JOE,No other loans to be discussed.
14_JIM,"I got a couple things here, but uh, we'll um, the one, is in regard to, the retail, nondeposit investment, just to kind of bring us up to speed, m- Matt has tentatively accepted our offer for employment, but since he's going to be a dual employee, th-... you really don't need to put this in the minutes... <XX>."
14_JOE,Hm. Okay.
14_JIM,"I'll I'll c-. I'll catch up the board up to speed, I just want us to know, because it has some loan relevance. Uh he was interviewed by LCL, Larry Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday, and, Larry called me this morning, that's who had called about seven-thirty, and said everything went fine. Um, what... what we have set up is, Matt's going up to Chicago, at LCL's office, on uh, for Monday evening, Tuesday, and Wednesday training. The f-. The Monday evening and Tuesday training, will be very specific for him, their workflow, their forms, he'll get to meet these people. On Wednesday then, he'll be in a little bit of a larger group, there may be four or five other asset managers with him, discussing sails motivations and, and and sales approaches and strategies, uh Larry said, Ph- he doesn't know how Matt's gonna plug into us, philosophically, and how well he's known in the area. He said that's our decision. Of which, I- you know, I'm comfortable with. I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do, plugging into the selling, and he said oh, you... he should be... he should do very well. So I- I'm, um, tho-... that looks good. What I did, kind of, in regard to that, was, and, I don't have this date finalized, but, s-. I'm trying to go maybe the second week of January, to have a representative of Bankers Systems, come here... to do some specialized training, within the qualified retirement plan area. Matt needs, Matt needs an understanding of, not a detailed understanding, but how all these qualified plans work, so that he w- can have, so he understands how, his products plug into the to the self-directed IRAs, SEPs, and the like. We also, it would do us good to know what products we can offer, under those qualified retirement plans. So, uh R-. Ray Galino I I believe is his name is, supposed to come down, I haven't set up a date, but, he'll be here on a f-... for a day, and I wanted him to talk with Matt, Vivian, myself, and, sometime during the day to the two of you. Because as loan officers, you have a good handle on borrowers and, and can kind of tell them of these SEPs, and some of the other products. Uh, we've kind of hesitated in in offering those..."
14_X,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"Well, we have not offered the self-directed."
14_JOE,Hm.
14_JIM,"Offering the self-directed we're getting, is simply, we need to get a dif-... fifty different forms. Instead of called an IRA, it's called an IRA SD, for self-directed. And then, that will allow people, to, if they don't want all their funds in a bank CD, as as are custodial IRA arrangements. See, the existing IRA says, all those funds have to be in First National Bank of Hillsdale. The self-directed, the the participant signs a an investment direction, or, where where he directs the investments. They sign the form, and then you invest in whatever they want to."
14_JOE,Yeah... <XX> <XX>.
14_JIM,"Uh, the, what. How that works like with the SEPs, the SEP has a vehicle, has to be connected to the IRA. So we take the SEP off the shelf, and then if the person wants that money put into a bank CD, then we just use our custodial IRA forms. If they want a self-directed i- SEP, you take the same SEP form off, but you're using a different IRA. You're not using the custodial IRA arrangement."
14_FRED,"Oh, okay."
14_JIM,Uh An SEP must have an IRA attached to it. So that-.
14_FRED,"So, the IRAs all fit in the same plan. They're just different ch- boxes checked off of this overall plan. And that, the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back, that's what the IRS has blessed."
14_JIM,Right. They.
14_FRED,"Is the framework, and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination, you're okay."
14_JIM,"Exactly. So, I I had talked with with Rick uh Brady today..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"And, he's gonna send me those forms, so we can take a look at em, The other. The thing which makes it a little more complicated, but it's really not a cost, it's kind of a s- flip-flop, in that, he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self-directed IRAs ourselves. Because of how complicated the law is in all this."
14_FRED,Mhm.
14_JIM,So.
14_FRED,Mhm...
14_JIM,"I mean, coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive account maintainance services..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JOE,You're kidding.
14_JIM,Isn't that <XX>...
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JOE,"Well, isn't that a surprise..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,That- that's such a surprise.
14_JOE,Yeah...
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"And, what- what- what we would do is, they would take care of the account maintainance..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"In a similar manner, if you will, as they take care of the, the other qualified plans."
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_JIM,"We-. They-. We send them the information, th-."
14_JOE,"But they print it, and."
14_JIM,They. They crank out the numbers.
14_JOE,"Qualify it, and."
14_JIM,"And, and they file whatever needs to be filed."
14_JOE,"Disclose it, Mhm."
14_JIM,"The. It's really not gonna cost us, it it's gonna be pretty much of a swap. Right now, we use their eight-hundred number, and their, uh, fi-... their newsletter... for the IRAs. We don't have their comprehensive service, we have their IRA service. And that runs about three-hundred dollars a year. If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance, the eight-hundred number is included, and the f-... and the newsletter is included. So we would drop three-hundred dollars off. The account maintenance, comprehensive account maintenance, maintenance would cost us five-hundred dollars. But, what you do is, they-... he estimates it'd be five-hundred dollars, for a minimal number of accounts, Banker System charges thirty-five dollars an account. And he said under a self-directed arrangement, he's seen charges, to maintain a self-directed IRA, anywhere from forty to a hundred fifty dollars. Now I think a hundred fifty dollars is a lot, to maintain a self-directed IRA."
14_FRED,Mhm. So you mean.
14_JIM,Uh.
14_FRED,That you... we could pass that back to the customer. That's what you're saying.
14_JIM,Right. Right. We.
14_FRED,They charge us five-hundred plus thirty-five per account.
14_JIM,"Well he- he thought... he's gonna send me down the information, you know how the typical salesman, they, they they d- talk in kind of nebulous terms."
14_FRED,Yeah.
14_JIM,But he thought.
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,"W- they... they have a minimum number of accounts, uh."
14_FRED,"Oh, with w-... is covered if you will by the five-hundred."
14_JIM,Yes.
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,"And so he said, uh uh uh way I understood it would, let's say five-hundred would would cover the eight-hundred, which is very very helpful service."
14_FRED,Mhm.
14_JIM,"And uh, the maintenance for let's say twenty accounts. Well, if we had ten accounts."
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,"We would charge uh five-hundred fifty dollars on ac- on an account, it would be five-hundred dollars, it's really kind of a switch around but, what what that would. I think it would be good for the five or six of us, to, to have Galino down here, can kind of explain what products, we can offer from the bank side."
14_JOE,Hm.
14_JIM,"Matt needs to know that, and and we all need to know that, and then, we can figure out how Matt's, the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that. And it's. I was thinking of sending Matt up there for a week, but, you know he's up there a week, he's gonna learn a lot of very technical information, such as like those section four-fifteen XSes. That that I was talking about. You really don't need to know the the technical, nitty-gritty about it, because, that's what Bankers Systems does. They take care of the nitty-gritty."
14_JOE,Hm.
14_JIM,"So, it's gonna be less expensive, to have Galino come here, instead of one person going up to to Minnesota for a week, and then trying to bring back the information, we're gonna have Galino come down here for a day, and, he won't... he won't touch any specific complicated items. Such as four-fifteen XSes or, or ACP testing or that. Cause Vivian and I kind of know that, but if we don't know that..."
14_JOE,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,Like that four-fifteen uh XS.
14_FRED,Mhm.
14_JIM,"I called the eight-hundred number, and and they went through the explanation, where the IRS changed the the deduction."
14_FRED,"Just a. Just a question... from a mechanics. Who's gonna hold the account. Is LCL gonna hold the account, is the bank gonna ho- hold the account, Who act-. You know, you're talking about bank products, and and LCL products, like before, the trust department, if you will, held the account. That that's physically where it was."
14_JIM,Mhm.
14_FRED,"You know, Is is it's. I- uh is the plan uh uh gonna be in the bank, or will the plan be in LCL, or is the plan uh just kind of nebulous."
14_JIM,"Well... well the the SEP and the IRA, will- will be First National Bank of Hillsdale."
14_FRED,Okay. That's what I meant.
14_JIM,But but tho- those.
14_FRED,"They're bank products... if you will. We offer those, and then LCL, if will have, within that plan, they'll have things you can buy, if you want to direct it that way. If you don't want a CD."
14_JIM,Tha- the-.
14_FRED,"Or if you want something else, you could direct that, that the monies be used to buy some mutual fund, or some bond fund or something."
14_JIM,Right. And how I envision that then.
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,"We would get the statement from LCL, for the mutual fund holdings, let's say the person also had a CD."
14_FRED,Okay. Mhm.
14_JIM,"Let's. You know, it doesn't matter how they split it."
14_FRED,Like we do now.
14_JIM,"And then then, what what we would have to do is, pull that information together. We would get LCL's statement, as of the end of the year. What the income was, and what the balance was, we would then have to, if they had a CD, pull that in, we would report that up to Bankers Systems."
14_FRED,Okay.
14_JIM,"And they would then combine that, and produce the report. It. That's why there's normally a cost in those self-directed, because, it's not, with our CDs now, that information, that's the whole account, and whatever's out there on the on the retire-, on the RAP record, just passes right up, and and the CD and the RAP information, r- retirement account processing system talk together."
14_FRED,Mhm.
14_JIM,"When you get another vendor in here, like LCL, we physically have to put the papers together. But it's not that complicated."
14_JOE,But the name of his office is gonna be LCL.
14_JIM,S-.
14_JOE,It's not gonna be First National Bank.
14_JIM,Right. Right.
14_JOE,Anything.
14_JIM,"The- the. I got a f-. Oh. Yeah, I love expansions of business. It took me forty-five minutes to get a phone number..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,The phone number by the way is.
14_JOE,For LCL. Yeah.
14_JIM,"Five Five Five, Five Five Five Five. Is what the phone number will be. But, this is things that, I'm I'm anxious for Matt to get here, because I'm getting, I'm getting tuckered out, trying to get all these nitty-gritty things..."
14_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,It's not tough to get the phone number. But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead.
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_JIM,In order to or- uh have business cards. LCL in in Chicago needs that.
14_FRED,Mhm.
14_JIM,To get that process going.
14_JOE,Hm.
14_JIM,Uh.
14_JOE,Uh is there LCL accounts gonna be maintained here.
14_JIM,Cause cause actually.
14_JOE,"I mean, or is there gonna be a separate, They're gonna have an account in Chicago, for the funds to pass through. Or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank. Or, is that uh."
14_JIM,"Well, w- what we'll do is, those'll probably wire transfer out."
14_JOE,Through Boltmans or something.
14_JIM,"Well, through the Fed, what. I think what will happen, but we. Matt'll find this out, and, I mean, we'll get involved in it, and I'm. I'm not... whichever way it goes is fine, but probably the most sophisticated way, will be, everyone who makes... who buys a fund, or whatever, that money will go into a a clearing account here. And then, we will, either LCL will will ACH it out of us..."
14_JOE,<XX> <XX>.
14_JIM,"Or, we'll physically wire it up there. You know, there may be a hundred thousand dollars in there, which may represent three people's, or four people's purchases."
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_JIM,"And then Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL, and they do the suitability testing, and then they know what products have been bought, and then on the other side, we do a wire transfer, to physically get the money up there. I think that's how it's gonna work."
14_FRED,Si- similar to Fannie Mae.
14_JIM,Ex- ex-. Uh yes.
14_JOE,Mhm.
14_JIM,Sa- same- same- same type of thing.
14_JOE,Yeah.
14_FRED,We we we collect monies.
14_JOE,Custodial account.
14_FRED,We collect monies.
14_JOE,And.
14_FRED,"Put it in account, and then, we tell them how much of it is theirs, and, by calling up there..."
14_JOE,<XX>.
14_FRED,"And that dial deal, and then it- they zap it the next day."
14_JIM,Yeah. I don't know if.
14_JOE,Okay.
14_JIM,"Uh like, that's the same way that uh American Express with the traveler's checks work. When we sell Traveler's Checks, we put that money in a clearing account, and then Jo Anne, or Grace, or Tom, or somebody calls, whosever doing that job, calls a number."
14_FRED,Mhm.
14_JIM,"And, we report, how much in sales we had, and they d-... they d- hit the account the next day and take the money out. But that's... that's kind of the the mechanics of the of the flow of funds. But, to answer your question Joe, is that, LCL, that office will not say First National Bank of Hillsdale, uh or anything of the nature."
14_JOE,Anywhere. Yeah.
14_JIM,"Uh, the... his his card will be LCL investments, at First National Bank of Hillsdale. Um, letterhead will be LCL, there needs to be a separate phone line, going to that office. And we'll... we'll be able-, when we get this receptionist set up, the receptionist will also answer it, but when they pick up the phone, you know we'll put it on a red line, or blue line or something like that, when they pick up that line, like we do with with with Bill's number, you know they they pick up, and they'll say LCL investments. They also... and it's also requirements by uh, uh I guess NASDAQ or whomever, and the comptroller that, they don't want us, when that line rings, we're not gonna pick it up and go, hello, First National Bank of Hillsdale, and they go, oh yeah, I wanted to talk about a mutual fund, oh I'm sorry, yeah, you do have LCL in- investments. I mean, these are some of the nitty-gritty things."
14_JOE,Yeah.
14_JIM,"They they talk about in the regulation, and I'm pretty confident they'll they'll implement those out. But."
14_JOE,"Is Matt gonna carry on his other livelihood that he had before, through that office. Or, is he totally out of the insurance business."
14_JIM,"N, He was meeting with-... they had a regional meeting-, or, meeting with their regional manager today, and he was going to to tell him, that, he's plans to take a job here. C- Common courtesy says, that he uh needs to give em two weeks notice. But, the- the practice within the the industry, and Larry. Matt said this, and also Larry Harb said this. So, I know it's not Matt's employer, it's just within that industry, as soon as a person says, I've decided to move on to another... another uh uh customer..."
14_JOE,<XX>.
14_JIM,Or an- another employer...
14_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,Ni-. Come in...
14_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
14_VIVI,Did you need to talk to Genevieve.
14_JIM,"N- uh I'll g-... see if she's gonna be, at a number where I could talk to her in maybe a half an hour or forty-five minutes."
14_VIVI,Okay.
14_JIM,Or else I'll give her a call tomorrow.
14_VIVI,Okay.
14_JIM,Um...
14_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
14_JIM,"As soon as they get notice, they typically say well fine, thanks for the two weeks notice, but it's effective today. And then they electronically transfer his licenses, to his-... NA"
