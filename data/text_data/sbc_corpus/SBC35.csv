35_DALE,Put it on that railing over there.
35_MAUR,Okay.
35_PATT,Mm.
35_STEP,"So, I'd better get twelve hundred on these. Have to get twelve hundred..."
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,Well if you study hard.
35_STEP,You can't study for the SAT.
35_PATT,"Get your rest, uh no, but you. Well, they say yes you can, because they have all these groups that say, that if you take their classes, and they go over the test."
35_STEP,"No. Mom, Mom, Mom."
35_PATT,"You can raise your points, you can raise your points a couple hundred points."
35_STEP,"The SAT, the SAT board itself has said."
35_ERIK,Yeah.
35_STEP,"Yeah, but that's just by learning tricks. I know what the tricks are. That's all you need to know."
35_ERIK,Teach them to me.
35_STEP,The only way you can.
35_PATT,But what you have to remember is that.
35_STEP,The only way you can score high is if you read a lot. That's all.
35_PATT,What you have to remember is.
35_STEP,You can't study <XX>.
35_PATT,That the SAT is not a whole measure of who you are.
35_STEP,Oh I know.
35_PATT,"It doesn't measure your creativity, it doesn't measure you know so."
35_STEP,"Mom, I know. Mom. I'm not saying that. But I do need to have a better SAT score for applications. So I wanna bring it up."
35_PATT,What'd you say your score was.
35_STEP,Ten seventy.
35_ERIK,I'd be happy to get seven hundred.
35_PATT,Well you'd only taken it once so.
35_STEP,Yeah...
35_ERIK,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,I think Claire took hers a couple times.
35_STEP,What.
35_ERIK,I said I'd be happy to get seven hundred.
35_STEP,"I I mean, yeah, people in my school when I told em my score were like, oh, you won't need to take it again, but then like, my friends who have like thirteen fifty on their SAT's."
35_ERIK,Who's that.
35_PATT,But Stephanie.
35_GAIL,"Yeah, but I mean you can- you can't compare yourself."
35_PATT,"You cannot compare yourself, you are uniquely you."
35_STEP,Mark...
35_ERIK,<XX>.
35_PATT,You can't do that.
35_STEP,John.
35_ERIK,Glen.
35_STEP,Glen got s- what. Glen got fifteen seventy or something like that.
35_PATT,"Stephanie, you cannot com-."
35_STEP,I was like you make me sick.
35_PATT,Stephanie.
35_ERIK,But don't you be like Glen is.
35_PATT,You can't compare yourself.
35_STEP,"I know, Glen has to like get dates through the computer."
35_ERIK,How do you think I feel when I get around Glen.
35_PATT,"When you learn that you can't compare, you'll really be grown up. You are uniquely you."
35_STEP,"No, I mean."
35_PATT,You are not like anybody else.
35_STEP,I. But Mom.
35_PATT,You have to accept that.
35_STEP,"The reason I am saying I need to bring them up, and the fact that other people have higher scores, is that, I do need to bring them up from ten seventy, if I wanna have a better chance at getting into colleges."
35_ERIK,Where's your bathroom at.
35_MAUR,Right around the bend.
35_PATT,It's not all they look at though.
35_MAUR,Or upstairs. One or the other.
35_STEP,"Yes, But it's one of the things that a lot of colleges use."
35_ERIK,I'll find one...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_GAIL,Right around the bend.
35_PATT,"Well, you know."
35_MAUR,Or you can go upstairs if you want Erika.
35_PATT,Just uh.
35_STEP,Well.
35_MAUR,With all those guys sitting there.
35_PATT,Well it's on.
35_GAIL,I can't <XX>. I should look around and see what else is.
35_MAUR,"Go up to the top of the stairs, go straight ahead."
35_GAIL,What else is there.
35_MAUR,And you'll see it on the right.
35_ERIK,Okay.
35_GAIL,There's a good see.
35_PATT,How about this school called Adrian College in Michigan...
35_STEP,<XX>. Yeah.
35_PATT,It's real.
35_STEP,It's in Adrian Michigan.
35_PATT,Not very far from uh Ann Arbor. They sent you a lotta information. Sounds like a neat school.
35_STEP,"But, they don't have a lot of."
35_PATT,It's a smaller school.
35_GAIL,I had a really good book that I should give you.
35_STEP,"They don't have that many majors Mom. I wanna go to a school that has a large variety of majors, and so if I change, I have something to look at."
35_PATT,You have to remember one thing.
35_GAIL,Hm.
35_PATT,"And and I don't know, maybe maybe Gail could talk about that."
35_GAIL,OU had a good art department.
35_PATT,Gail went to a big school. A big school was very different than a small school. Now Aunt Maureen went to a smaller school.
35_STEP,"Mom, I want-."
35_PATT,Well they bo-. Now wait. They both have advantages and disadvantages. Both of them. You have to see which ones fits your personality best.
35_STEP,Oh I know. But Mom.
35_PATT,That's it.
35_STEP,"Of my personality, even Claire said, that she thinks I would do fine at a bi-."
35_PATT,Don't take Claire as an authority.
35_STEP,I'm not taking her as an authority...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_GAIL,Ah.
35_PATT,"Believe me, I've lived with Claire."
35_STEP,I'm just saying that...
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"But Mom, if I wanna go to a big school, that's my choice."
35_PATT,"If I'm willing to pay for it, yes."
35_STEP,It's cheaper to go to a university than it is to go to a private school Mom.
35_PATT,Depends where you feel comfortable.
35_MAUR,"Uh, I have a platter."
35_PATT,When you get on a campus sometimes I think it might.
35_MAUR,You can get a platter for that it's.
35_PATT,Gail might say.
35_GAIL,"Yeah you have to go, you have to go out and visit and then."
35_PATT,"You feel like, hey I like this place, I think I could belong, or you think, I don't I don't feel comfortable here."
35_GAIL,I don't feel comfortable here.
35_PATT,And that's what has to be your final goal.
35_STEP,"Oh yeah, I know that."
35_PATT,"A place that has what you want, but you feel good about it."
35_STEP,But.
35_PATT,"You walk on campus and you think, hey there's something about this place."
35_MAUR,I'll dump this outside.
35_PATT,"That, that speaks to me."
35_STEP,I had one college that did that.
35_PATT,"You know, you don't know that until you're on the campus."
35_STEP,I had a college that did that.
35_GAIL,Mm.
35_STEP,"But I would nev-. I can't get in, cause it's just too impossible. Duke University."
35_GAIL,Yeah. Duke. Yeah.
35_STEP,I fell in love with that school right away but.
35_MAUR,"Well, you can always apply."
35_GAIL,"Apply, that's true."
35_MAUR,Absolutely.
35_STEP,"Yeah. But, I don't know if I'm gonna bother, cause it's like a seventy- five- dollar application fee, and the chances of me getting in there are like zilch. So."
35_MAUR,"What, what do they require."
35_STEP,"Ih, the people that I have met that have gotten in, had four point o's, uh, fourteen hundred on their SAT's and uh."
35_PATT,"Well kiddo, you had a chance to study, you know, I mean that's."
35_STEP,"Basically, they they were in like."
35_PATT,Kept telling her.
35_STEP,"The three clubs like, the Young Republicans."
35_PATT,"Comes you know, when it comes down to the you know."
35_STEP,Uh...
35_GENE,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,Some uh like business management and something else...
35_GENE,<XX> uh uh.
35_PATT,Past performance has something to say about that.
35_STEP,You know.
35_PATT,"But Stephanie, I've been telling you for four years, you've gotta work hard."
35_STEP,"Mom, Mom, Mom."
35_MAUR,Gail understands.
35_STEP,I don't wanna hear it.
35_MAUR,Good old BU.
35_GAIL,Good old BU didn't want me. No BC...
35_STEP,<XX>.
35_MAUR,BC. They didn't want her.
35_GAIL,They didn't want me.
35_MAUR,"She snowed the interviewer, but they still didn't want her..."
35_STEP,You snowed the interviewer.
35_GAIL,The interviewer was so good-looking...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,Ha ha-ha...
35_STEP,I love it.
35_GAIL,"He was this young attorney. He was real young, and I had my interview in the US Steel Building. And I went up there and, but. You know what, they asked me some really weird questions though."
35_MAUR,I know. I know.
35_PATT,They did.
35_GAIL,"Like they. I expected to go in there and talk about, you know my life, and what I wanted out of a school, and what I expected from them and."
35_PATT,So what did they ask you.
35_GAIL,They asked me what my stance was abou- on abortion...
35_PATT,"Boy that was a dumb question, that's one."
35_GAIL,Boom. I was like.
35_PATT,"That's a controversial question, so I would think that's a dumb one to ask."
35_GAIL,Well.
35_PATT,It's controversial.
35_GAIL,"Well they asked me that, and they asked me."
35_PATT,And personal.
35_GAIL,How I thought about drug testing in the workplace.
35_PATT,It's very personal. Very personal. Those are both personal questions.
35_STEP,You know what. Williams did the s-.
35_GAIL,"Well, you know what's funny is, you know, BC is a Catholic school."
35_PATT,Yeah.
35_GAIL,"And I th-. You know, I don't think they really liked my answer..."
35_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
35_GAIL,But uh.
35_PATT,That's. But you have.
35_STEP,Well.
35_PATT,But you still have freedom of choice.
35_STEP,You know what.
35_GAIL,That's right.
35_PATT,"Yeah, I mean..."
35_GAIL,<XX>.
35_STEP,"Williams is the same way. Cause Lee went, and, Lee applied to Williams. And she got waitlisted. And Williams used to be really lib-... liberal whatever. But lately, the information they're sending out is, a nice value community uh, moral stance, da-da-da-da-da I mean."
35_PATT,There's nothing wrong with that.
35_STEP,"Well no, but what they're do-."
35_PATT,That's important.
35_STEP,"But, but m- Mom, what I'm saying is."
35_PATT,I'm listening.
35_STEP,"They had, years ago, they had the sit-ins, everything you know, real liberal, now they're going to conservative, and when she was interviewed for it, they took her answers very slowly, and they waitlisted her, she had the grades, but she didn't have the political views. And, uh, that's what was happening."
35_PATT,"So maybe she was better to be in a place, where she's free to express herself."
35_STEP,"Oh yeah, Rice, Rice is great. She."
35_PATT,You know.
35_STEP,"Rice is really liberal, <XX> <XX> <XX> <XX>."
35_PATT,Things work out sometimes for the best...
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,As maybe Gail realizes too you know.
35_STEP,Oh she's much happier at.
35_GAIL,Yeah.
35_STEP,She's happy in Texas. She's really happy there.
35_GAIL,Where is Rice.
35_STEP,It's in Houston.
35_GAIL,Houston.
35_STEP,"It's right outside of Houston, she r- she loves it there... uh Um, they, their admissions were higher than Harvard's this year."
35_GAIL,Really.
35_STEP,They have one of the top history departments <XX> <XX>.
35_GENE,Maureen didn't have any trouble deciding.
35_GAIL,Hm.
35_PATT,Well sometimes you don't. Some people are lucky.
35_GAIL,Why.
35_PATT,They always know where they wanna be or what and.
35_GAIL,Why was that. I was probably the hardest person to find a school for...
35_PATT,<XX>.
35_GAIL,"Because everyone, in my family, knew what they wanted to major in."
35_PATT,And you weren't sure.
35_GAIL,Immediately.
35_PATT,And Stephanie's not sure either.
35_GAIL,"And I was kinda like, yeah, I was like."
35_PATT,She has some idea-.
35_GAIL,Well.
35_STEP,Yes I am.
35_PATT,Well.
35_GAIL,What're you gonna be.
35_STEP,I'm gonna be an art historian.
35_MAUR,She-. I thought she was gonna be a short-order chef. That's what she...
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,Well she has no experience at that in my house.
35_GAIL,A professional griller.
35_STEP,I have it at the store...
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_GENE,Stephanie.
35_ERIK,A manager of Tasty Freeze.
35_GENE,What are you going to w-. What are you going to be...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,An art historian.
35_MAUR,Isn't that what you <XX> <XX>.
35_GENE,A what.
35_STEP,Well an art history major...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,Depends on what I minor in.
35_GAIL,Art.
35_ERIK,I wanna be a social worker.
35_MAUR,Oh what an excellent choice.
35_STEP,I have to determine my minor.
35_PATT,Probably be good at that...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,"I kept telling Stephanie, that's what she should be, and she loves to talk to people, that's where she should be, and she's."
35_STEP,But if I am a.
35_GAIL,Hey you could be in human resources like me.
35_PATT,"Hey, pour me some more of that, I'm not going anywhere tonight..."
35_X,<XX>.
35_GAIL,"You can be like, in human resources like me..."
35_STEP,<NONVERBAL>

35_PATT,I have keys.
35_GAIL,Get into what I'm getting into.
35_PATT,"I drove here, I have keys."
35_STEP,"Oh that's right, you did drive here."
35_PATT,"It's it's, you know."
35_STEP,I could've drank anything...
35_PATT,"Well I think the th- important thing that maybe we should all say to you Stephanie, and you need to listen is, you have to keep an open mind. Don't cross any school off before you see it."
35_GENE,That's right...
35_PATT,You know.
35_STEP,Oh yeah.
35_PATT,Don't cross off Geneva before you go there.
35_STEP,I'm not crossing it off.
35_PATT,"I know it's far away and it's not a big town but, don't already think, I don't wanna go there because."
35_STEP,It's not far away.
35_PATT,"It's not near a big metropolitan area... uh You know y-, uh she wasn't near a big metropolitan area. Right."
35_GAIL,"But, I had thought that I wanted to be near big area."
35_STEP,But I also went to high school in a big metropolitan area.
35_PATT,But what but. But we're saying. So.
35_GAIL,"But, it doesn't matter though."
35_PATT,So did she.
35_GAIL,I mean.
35_PATT,"She, I mean, she wasn't downtown."
35_GAIL,I had my access to the city.
35_PATT,But she lived in Pittsburgh all her life.
35_STEP,Yeah.
35_GAIL,You know.
35_PATT,She did the same things you did.
35_STEP,But there's.
35_PATT,"She went to the opera, she went to the symphony, she went to the ballet, so she grew up in a cosmopolitan atmosphere."
35_STEP,"If there's not a coffee house on the campus, I'm not going."
35_PATT,They all have coffee houses.
35_GAIL,That's. They all do.
35_PATT,That's the latest thing...
35_GAIL,<XX>...
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,You know.
35_GAIL,They changed our bar.
35_PATT,But what I'm saying is.
35_GAIL,"On our campus, to a coffee house."
35_PATT,Don't eliminate a school...
35_STEP,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,By where it is.
35_GENE,Are you sure.
35_PATT,And what somebody has told you.
35_GENE,Are you sure you're old enough to go to college...
35_PATT,Well I'm not sure about that.
35_STEP,"So far as I know, yeah. I I I graduate this year uh, yeah."
35_GAIL,Well you know I had some really really big problems...
35_STEP,<NONVERBAL>
35_GAIL,"When I first went to OU, for the first quarter..."
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_GAIL,But it wasn't...
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_GAIL,It ended up.
35_MAUR,I wondered if you were gonna tell <XX>.
35_GAIL,"Well uh, well the thing is that."
35_PATT,Well that's good to share.
35_GAIL,"It ended up not being, I mean it doesn't really matter, the atmosphere, eventually it doesn't matter the atmosphere, because eventually, it's the people that you meet."
35_MAUR,When you're ready I need.
35_GAIL,The professors that you meet.
35_MAUR,My son-in-law to reach that platter.
35_GAIL,Your classes itself.
35_DALE,Okay.
35_GAIL,That really become important. You know.
35_STEP,Mhm.
35_PATT,Right. And that should be your first priority.
35_GAIL,"Yeah. Yeah, and that'll, I mean."
35_PATT,What you do extracurricular.
35_DALE,Where's the be-. Where's that bread that you want.
35_PATT,Can't be important.
35_STEP,But.
35_PATT,Because that's not what you're there for.
35_STEP,"But if you're not. But, Mom."
35_X,Mm.
35_STEP,If you're not happy in your setting.
35_MAUR,I'll have Jerry get them down.
35_STEP,You're not gonna be happy with where you are.
35_PATT,"I'll tell you what kid, if you're going to college to have a good time..."
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,One year is all I'm paying for.
35_STEP,I'm not going to college to have a good time.
35_PATT,The rest is on your own.
35_MAUR,Dale.
35_PATT,I already told you that.
35_MAUR,Dale.
35_STEP,"But it's like, it's a proven fact that."
35_DALE,Uh No that's alright.
35_MAUR,"No, here."
35_DALE,I know.
35_STEP,People work better in a comfortable situation.
35_PATT,Exactly but.
35_STEP,Than in an uncomfortable situation.
35_PATT,"Extra. But you don't have to be near a big city, Aunt Maureen wasn't beer- near a big city."
35_STEP,"Mom, it's a little different. I'm a different person."
35_PATT,True.
35_STEP,I like city life.
35_PATT,Exactly.
35_STEP,I have always liked city life.
35_PATT,"Then stay here and go to Pitt, it'll be very cheap."
35_STEP,No...
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,I like city life away from parents.
35_PATT,"I like. I like that. Could you imagine Gail, it'll be very cheap."
35_GAIL,Why don't. Why don't you look at.
35_GENE,Honey you'll be away from parents anyway.
35_STEP,"No, in my opinion."
35_GAIL,"Let's look at. Let's look at cities. What kinda cities do you like. Do you like big cities, like a Chicago. Or do you like a Pittsburgh..."
35_X,<XX>.
35_PATT,She's never been in a big city like Chicago. She couldn't identify with that.
35_ERIK,"You were in Chicago Steph, when we went to Easter."
35_STEP,I've been in Chicago.
35_PATT,When.
35_GAIL,"Pittsburgh, or Chicago."
35_STEP,Easter break. Two years ago.
35_GAIL,Chicago and Pittsburgh are very different.
35_PATT,"That's right, but what did you do in the city."
35_GAIL,I'm gonna give you.
35_PATT,Did you go downtown.
35_ERIK,"Shopped, we went to the biggest mall."
35_STEP,Yeah we went shopping.
35_PATT,"That's all you did. You can't shop when you're in college, you'll have no money for that. Ask Gail. You will not have money for that."
35_STEP,"Mom, I drove around LA. That tells me what a big city's like."
35_PATT,And that's pretty scary actually...
35_STEP,"No. Friday night, at nine o'clock, on Hollywood Boulevard is not a place to be. Okay."
35_PATT,They couldn't find the uh.
35_STEP,"No it wasn't that. We knew where it was, we just didn't know which exit to take."
35_PATT,"But, didn't get there."
35_ERIK,What were you looking for.
35_STEP,Universal Studios.

35_PATT,Yes...
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,Samantha and I go out.
35_GENE,She what.
35_PATT,She and Samantha Taylor get lost. Samantha knows where they're going but can't get there.
35_STEP,Well let me tell the story...
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,"Go ahead, tell."
35_STEP,"You don't know, because you weren't there."

35_PATT,"That's right, I heard it later."
35_STEP,"So we're driving and, uh we went and."
35_GENE,How do you put up with that.
35_STEP,We missed the exit...
35_GENE,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"She said, oh."
35_PATT,It's hard.
35_STEP,Well we'll just get off at the next exit.
35_PATT,Takes a lot of patience.
35_GENE,Yes it does.
35_STEP,"And, turn around."
35_PATT,Could be the hardest thing I've done in my life.
35_STEP,"So we got off at the exit, and, it was the Hollywood Bowl exit. She goes well, no big deal. Except, there was a Hollywood Bowl going on that night."
35_GAIL,Oh no.
35_STEP,"So here we are, stuck in this huge line of traffic. And we wanted to turn around, but you couldn't make a left turn because, they had parking going on. So you had to go all the way down, so we go all the way down and we hit Highland. So we take Highland and, we end up on Hollywood Boulevard. It is nine thirty at night, we're on Hollywood Boulevard, and it's Friday. Not a place you wanna be. Now we're trying to find a place to turn around."
35_GAIL,Reminds me of the scene in Valley Girl.
35_STEP,We drive by the Chinese theater.
35_ERIK,"Yeah, that one <XX>."
35_STEP,Yeah.
35_GAIL,"Yeah, you know..."
35_PATT,"Why didn't you just go to the Chinese theater, but you had tickets."
35_STEP,Yeah...
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,Right.
35_STEP,"We had, we had free tickets. That her mom won on the radio. Or on a raffle or something."
35_PATT,Oh that's neat.
35_X,Oh.
35_STEP,So...
35_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,We're going down.
35_PATT,They can't get there...
35_STEP,Well it gets.
35_PATT,It's not funny.
35_STEP,"I know, this is just the beginning..."
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"So we're on mo-. We're on Hollywood Boulevard, we're looking at all kinds of interesting things. And we're like okay, we gotta turn around. So we find this..."
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"We had no streets. That we could turn down, except for this one alleyway. So we turn down, in this dark alleyway, and we're turning the car around."
35_PATT,"Oh my god, good thing I didn't know this."
35_STEP,"And we see all these people in the alleyway, we're like, get us out of here. She backed up. So we're going back, and we get to the Hollywood Bowl, and we're stuck in traffic, you know, Sam's going, I hate LA, I hate it. She's screaming, I'm sitting there, and some guy's looking at us. And he keeps staring, and we're like what are you looking at. We're just lost. So, we get back on the freeway, we're like, sh- Sam's like, I know it was the exit before this one."
35_X,The big one.
35_MAUR,Yeah. Whatever you can reach up there.
35_STEP,I know that was the one it was.
35_MAUR,Any one of them will do.
35_STEP,"Okay, let's go."
35_MAUR,There's one on the top that's fine.
35_STEP,We go off the next exit.
35_MAUR,That's.
35_STEP,"And we see this huge sign, that says Universal Studios."
35_MAUR,That'll be fine.
35_STEP,But there's no arrow.
35_MAUR,Ah...
35_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
35_MAUR,<XX> <XX> <XX>.
35_STEP,"We're like, okay well, I guess that means we just go out this road."
35_MAUR,Thank you.
35_STEP,So we go up the road a while.
35_X,You're welcome.
35_STEP,"We're driving up this road and, all of a sudden we see Warner Brothers Studios. A sign that says, city limits of Burbank. Looked at Sam I said, Sam, we're in Burbank. And she goes..."
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,We're not supposed to be here...
35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_PATT,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,Turn around.
35_PATT,That's what happens when you let two seventeen-year-olds go off on a Friday night.
35_STEP,"Come back. So, now we go over..."
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"And we see the sign that says Universal Studios, and we're like, well it has to be around here somewhere, it's right here. So we go across."
35_GAIL,Isn't that in Burbank California. Universal Studios.
35_MAUR,I thought it was in Burbank.
35_GAIL,Yeah.
35_STEP,"It it's outside, it's like right next to Burbank, but."
35_GAIL,"That's, that's where uh the Love Connection is though."

35_MAUR,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"No no, I liked That's a More."
35_ERIK,"Yes, That's a More."
35_MAUR,Oh that one I don't know unfortunately.
35_STEP,"The one where like they bring in their infat-... or, infatuation, when they bring in someone they're infatuated with, and they ask them out, and the person either she ts-... sh-... like turns them down or goes out with em."
35_GAIL,"Oh, that's that one guy, from the soap opera. Dean."
35_STEP,It's.
35_GAIL,Dean from Another World.
35_STEP,"No, that that. Yeah."
35_GAIL,Is that it.
35_STEP,There's two.
35_ERIK,"No, that's another show."
35_STEP,"No, that's that's the new one."
35_GAIL,Oh okay.
35_MAUR,Oh.
35_STEP,There's like eight of em.
35_ERIK,That's yet another one.
35_STEP,Well.
35_PATT,Oh my God.
35_STEP,"So we're turning, and we see this pizza shop, and it's still open, and we're like, okay. Go in, we'll ask him, since the sign's right across here. We go in, and we're like, w-. Excuse me, but do you know where Universal Studios. Well it said on a sign right there, we're just like well there's no arrow pointing. He goes, yeah there is, the arrow is the last three inches of the billboard. And it's on the ground..."
35_GAIL,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,So there's a bush. Covering this big yellow arrow. You couldn't see it. We get to Universal Studios...
35_X,<NONVERBAL>
35_STEP,"It's ten o'clock, or no. It was."
35_PATT,Nine thirty I thought you said.
35_STEP,"It was, it was nine forty five or something like that, and they closed at eleven..."

35_STEP,We got on one ride.
35_PATT,They spent all night trying to get there...
35_STEP,"We're on the way home, I was like, let's not take another detour. She's like, Unh-unh..."
