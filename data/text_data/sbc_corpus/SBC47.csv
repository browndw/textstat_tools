47_RICH,He was after you.
47_FRED,But he's coming after me. And he calls me. And I'm walking out the door. Right as he's walking in the other one.
47_RICH,Unhunh...
47_FRED,"And he goes, Fred, I wanna talk to you, come here. And I go, oh man, what is this about. And on my production card. Let's see. The day before yesterday. I did ice cream. Right, Balian."
47_RICH,Unhunh.
47_FRED,And you gotta pack those in cases. And.
47_RICH,Right.

47_FRED,"Uh, I w-... uh, uh Gutierrez was doing the same job. But we weren't working together."
47_RICH,Oh you're working alone.
47_FRED,"N-yeah, and so, he comes and says, well, he goes, I don't know if you've, if you've, packed this or not. You know. On your production card, all it says, you know, is that you did three thousand sheets, but you did-."
47_RICH,Two loads.
47_FRED,"Yeah. But you didn't pack it. So I go, yeah, I go look man, there they are. You could see, there's my name, uh stamped right on there. I just didn't put it down.

47_RICH,It's always been like that.
47_FRED,It's. It's par for the course man. Right...
47_RICH,"Yeah, definitely. Ts- why I can't take that, that type of living anymore, even is this, uh, career doesn't work out for me, I'll find something that will."
47_FRED,"Something else. Well you're gonna do real estate maybe, right."
47_RICH,"Definitely, I'm. I got my books and everything, I'll be studying and uh, but in a sense, I need uh, some type of steady income."
47_FRED,"But, but uh, you s-. Th- the competition man. I mean, is it real tough. Like, on the lot."
47_RICH,"Yeah, it is. There's def-. And there's guys that've been doing that four or five years, and."

47_RICH,"Yeah but that all comes with time. You know, and."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"And they're pretty helpful with me, and uh, you know it'll all come in time. Right, I- I figure, the more cards I get out, the more people I talk to, n- the more cars I'm gonna sell. Just all comes with time. Once I get my experience, I'll be up there too in the top four salesman..."
47_FRED,Your parents don't know yet. Hunh.

47_RICH,"Yeah... definite-. I think s-... uh It's gonna be the fifteenth, which would be on a Saturday I think. And I'll be working till nine o'clock. So they'll, they'll be pretty happy for me, more or less, because uh, they didn't want me to work in the factory much longer."
47_FRED,"Yeah, I know. My mom doesn't know what to do to get me out. But, they didn't take a trip through, Brazil, and Argentina."
47_RICH,"I don't know, I don't know they- they, they didn't."

47_RICH,"But uh, they'll come back, they'll be happy to see me here, that I got a new career going, and uh."
47_FRED,"They weren't all heartbroken about, you know, Jeanie and that."
47_RICH,Well they have no idea what's happening right now.
47_FRED,They must have been. They have no idea <XX>.
47_RICH,"When they left, we were on shaky grounds, but, uh you know, they thought it might be able to work out. So when they come in, they'll be pretty shocked."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"And, and hurt. But uh, like I say, things will work out f- for the best."
47_FRED,"What about her folks. They're not sorry at all, huh."
47_RICH,"No uh, in fact I've seen em, I. I w- I went to church with em, for the last three Sundays."
47_FRED,Really.

47_FRED,Wow.
47_RICH,"She thought it might, you know, help our relationship as friends, and uh."
47_FRED,She still considers you man. Hunh.
47_RICH,"Exactly. She does, because I mean, we went to church together, for the last three Sundays."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"And then, then we went to the movies after, and her her folks were at church, and, you know, n- afterwards, her mom, w- had a injury on her leg or something, she wasn't at church last Sunday, we went to the, to their house... uh And uh, I went over there, and her brother was there, her nephews and nieces, her sister, our godson, And uh, you know, it was just like, everybody was real friendly and everything."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"I don't know if the parents are aware, that we did, you know."
47_FRED,Break up.
47_RICH,"Separate, but it, possibly was for the better, cause they, they didn't feel comfortable with us living together anyhow."
47_FRED,"Yeah... right, that's not looked on too good hunh."
47_RICH,"No. So, w- what they, what they probably think is, you know, that we still have a lot of love for each other, That, moving out was the best thing."
47_FRED,But sh-.
47_RICH,"Until we both are ready for marriage, and if she still loves me, and I still love her, and, we wanna get married, there's still the chance of us getting back together, and getting married this time."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"So I mean it. I think things are working out pretty good. She called me the other day and uh, you know, she calls me and talks to me, and I call her and ask her how her day was and everything."
47_FRED,"Yeah. What, what does uh, your sisters say."
47_RICH,"N- they tell me to stay away from her, don't even call or anything."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"Wait till she calls you and everything. But uh, you know, that's not right."

47_RICH,"I mean, if she accepts me calling her, and she doesn't tell me, don't call me or."
47_FRED,"They're telling you that, why. To, like uh."
47_RICH,"Cause they feel that, she's gonna get too strong, by me, you know uh, kissing her ass."

47_RICH,"Exactly. Which, which, you know, uh she probably already does. But, um."
47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"I'm not gonna just wait for her to call me, because it's not right, I have feelings for her, I wanna know, you know, how she's doing."
47_FRED,Doing.

47_FRED,"And then-. Then the, and what you wrote."
47_RICH,"Yeah, exactly. Cause she knew it came from my heart, no matter what, I'd put her through and everything, she knows deep down inside, I really did love her, but I had a problem or something."
47_FRED,Yeah. You had to get something out of your system.
47_RICH,"And, Yeah. But I don't even know what it is in fact. I might have to go to therapy or something, to find out..."
47_FRED,<NONVERBAL>
47_RICH,"Because there's no. There's no way I, I should..."
47_FRED,<NONVERBAL>

47_FRED,Yeah.
47_RICH,"This what a lady told me that, that was a therapist. She said she was gonna get me somebody to go talk to and everything. She said it po-. Ma-... possibily was I was uh, not satisfied with myself. I wasn't happy with myself for some reason, and that I just acted out of impulse."

47_RICH,"Handling the money, and uh, the only thing it is, th- I have to work on, is doing the paperwork. Is uh, filling out a contract, and uh, basically paperwork, which is f- very simple. That, you know, once it comes along with experience, and the more people I work with, the easier it will, it'll be, that's the most important thing and, and selling them the car, talking to somebody in, to buying a car, that doesn't wanna buy.

47_RICH,Exactly. Which isn't difficult...
47_FRED,<XX>.
47_RICH,"If you're on the lot, for a damn twelve hours uh, one car, isn't all that much, if you have the clients coming in. That's the only thing. If you have the traffic."
