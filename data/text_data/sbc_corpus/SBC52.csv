52_DARL,Like to the mall or anything.
52_CIND,"Well, we go out, Saturday morning to breakfast. Every Saturday, ad the place we go, is on, in the pyramid area, where they have kinda like a food court. So we're in the mall at least once a week."
52_DARL,Unhunh.
52_CIND,Which is bad...
52_DARL,"Well I watched don-. I watched Donahue. Well I didn't watch it, I went to work, I taped it and, when I came home I watched it. And they had a, show on about uh, mostly about doctors, and then hospitals too."
52_CIND,Unhunh.
52_DARL,Horror-story type things.
52_CIND,Oh joy.
52_DARL,"Remember that book y'all sent, Worst Pills Best Pills."
52_CIND,Oh yeah.
52_DARL,"I don't know if they're the same guys, but this is Best... uh, Good Surgery Bad Surgery."

52_CIND,Oh.
52_DARL,"But this guy, was some kinda, Oh I wrote it down. Medical society, but it's not connected to the medical profession, it's like a medical investigating place."
52_CIND,"Oh, that sounds like a good."
52_DARL,Um...
52_CIND,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,"Because, like they have one guy on there, Uh, he went in for arthroscopic surgery on his knee, almo-... he had last rites twice. And all kinds of stuff."
52_CIND,Unhunh.
52_DARL,"And he got so bad, The doctor did him the way that one doctor did you. Operate and then leave."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"Town. And, anyway, he almost died. Too. He almost died twice. Evidently, they gave him last rites twice."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"But um, uh, just. They held up the book, but they didn't say, who wrote it, they didn't. I told Janine, I wish they'd given that address, you can send and write off for it."
52_CIND,"You know I wish, that a lot of times, it seems like, when I'll, I won't care about, it'll introduce something on the Today Show or something, and they'll be talking about a book, or an album, or a CD, or anything you know. And I don't. They give it in the beginning, and I don't really care that much. And then, when they're done, they don't tell you what it is again."
52_DARL,Yeah.
52_CIND,And then I n-. Then I care. You know.
52_DARL,Yeah.
52_CIND,"Yeah, and that s- sounds like-."
52_DARL,"Well because. No, I had this on tape though. And they never did, I think they introduced the guy."
52_CIND,Period.
52_DARL,But they didn't say he was the one who wrote the book.
52_CIND,Hm.
52_DARL,"All... so all I got out of it, was the name of the book."
52_CIND,"You know what, if you go down to m-... a lot of those book stores, I'll bet you they'd track it by name. And."
52_DARL,Yeah.
52_CIND,"You know, you could find, cause you don't. You can do it either way. Yeah."
52_DARL,"Not that I'm planning on having surge-. Well I thought of going back to an orthopedic doctor, and seeing if they could do anything about my foot or my ankle, whatever it is that's giving me trouble."
52_CIND,"Yeah. You know, I thank God, because they w-..."
52_DARL,<NONVERBAL>
52_CIND,"You know how they've been talking about, what was it those uh screws, that they w- uh. They're okay, for different parts of the body, but then they-. Some of these d- orthopedic surgeons were going and putting em in the back."
52_DARL,Mm.
52_CIND,And they're just deadly. I mean these people are just in unbelievable agony. And-.
52_DARL,"Well they. What about that, uh, people being operated on on their jaw."
52_CIND,Oh.
52_DARL,That temporal stuff.
52_CIND,And they would.
52_DARL,"And they're putting in this stuff, that would- had never been tested."
52_CIND,I don't understand this sometimes.
52_DARL,"It was some kinda Teflon material, it had never been tested on animals even, or anything."
52_CIND,Hunh.
52_DARL,"And this guy started, it was a doctor. He invented it. And started his own business, and sold it to other doctors."
52_CIND,"Oh, wait a second. Um, Was that just recently on the news. Because that se-. Or was it okayed for-."
52_DARL,"It was on uh, like one of these, uh, Forty-eight Hours, or something like that."
52_CIND,Yeah. I wonder if I saw the similar report. Because that really sounded familiar.
52_DARL,"And, they- they had some people there who had had the surgery, and like, this one day- uh uh lady..."
52_ANDR,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,"All she. She was in so much pain, all she could do was curl up in bed all the time."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,And.
52_CIND,"That sounds like those screws things that, the one I was telling you about."
52_DARL,Yeah.
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"Well I don't know, these. I think they called em hinges or something."
52_CIND,Hm.
52_DARL,So um.
52_CIND,Terrifying. I don't...
52_DARL,You know.
52_CIND,Well.
52_DARL,I very briefly thought of having my jaw fixed for.
52_CIND,Uh-.
52_DARL,See my bottom jaw doesn't come up quite far enough.
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,And um.
52_CIND,I tell you.
52_DARL,That's.
52_CIND,"I'm gonna have to be in a really bi-. I- I- I'll admit, I've had bad experience. But, I'm not volunteering for anything."
52_DARL,Uh.
52_CIND,Surgery-wise.
52_DARL,"Well see, mine would be more for looks than anything else."
52_CIND,"Oh, Darlee it doesn't chang-."
52_DARL,Cause my jaws don't hurt.
52_CIND,You're li-. Your looks are fine.
52_DARL,"Uh, Don't ever take a picture of me from the side. I saw me on television. Talking, and they had a side angle. And it looked terrible..."
52_CIND,"Yeah, but you're probably extremely critical too. And everybody else probably wouldn't even."
52_DARL,Yeah.
52_CIND,You know.
52_DARL,"Because this guy, at work... uh, well, they had they had it on the night before. It's back when they had this, San Antonio Housing Authority putting, the houses in your neighborhood, and they put three on my street. You know, I said hey, if you wanna be fair about it, spread it around the neighborhood, Don't just put em all, They put all three on my street. And."
52_CIND,They put what on your street...
52_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,"Uh, public housing."
52_CIND,Oh yeah. They do that a lot in a lotta areas. They're doing that around here too.
52_DARL,"Yeah but, this is. Usually it's uh, uh p- uh, oh what is it."
52_ANDR,It's on the cords.
52_DARL,"Uh, Something with a number in it..."
52_ANDR,<XX> hold this <XX>.
52_CIND,Hu- it's not like HUD...
52_ANDR,<NONVERBAL>
52_CIND,Yeah that's how they. That's public housing.
52_DARL,"There's HUD, and then there's something else..."
52_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
52_CIND,"Hm, I don't really know."
52_DARL,"And uh, They check on the stuff and all. At least San Antonio Housing Authority does, Well, it's real funny, One of the guys is, uh family is, and it's uh, husband and wife and two kids. He works for the city, he works for the city dogcatcher, I don't know how much they make, But, like my house, damn good thing I bought it when I did, My friend up the street, she pays almost five-hundred dollars a month house payments, this guy gets his for ninety dollars a month."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,I mean...
52_CIND,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,Give the people who aren't making the money a break. But one fifth...
52_ANDR,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,"You know, How much could that person be making less than say Danny right now. Um."
52_CIND,"Yeah, I don't really know..."
52_DARL,"But, So uh, other than it looking kinda tacky, they just got all kinda planters, and all kinda crap piled outside. They don't. They haven't gotten to the point of, putting their old water heater out there or anything like that, There's one house, when they started all this, we. Somebody got a list of the houses on this one, um, subsidized thing."
52_CIND,Unhunh.
52_DARL,"And, uh me, and about five other people, drove around to all these houses, to see what they look like..."
52_CIND,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,"And, about half of em were as nice as mine or nicer. S- kept up. You know m-, Then some of em had better uh landscaping. But, you know like I keep my lawn mowed, and trimmed and all that. About half of em were as good, or better than mine. Which. That's fine."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"They they uh. I thought they were doing a real good job. The other half, they, long weeds and stuff was the least of the the problem. This one house had, it looked like an abandoned junkyard. It had so many old appliances, and broken down shit out in the front yard. I don't know what the-... what the thing was."
52_CIND,But you find people do that.
52_DARL,If they were my neighbors.
52_CIND,"That-... all all. I mean, I hate to say it, a lotta times the people in our neighborhood. That do that. There's no reason for. I cannot-. I don't underst-. Of course I don't know their finances."
52_DARL,Yeah.
52_CIND,"I mean, you know."
52_DARL,Right.
52_CIND,"I'm not into their books, or anything, But I I. There doesn't appear to be any logical reason for it to me."
52_DARL,They're just pack rats.
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"Or something, I don't know."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"But if. Hey. If, If people had to come to my house, and pass one of these houses that look like that."
52_CIND,"I know, it's depressing."
52_DARL,"I'd call the health department, and tell em it's a health hazard. Cause I think it is."
52_CIND,Yeah. Well.
52_DARL,It's gotta breed rats and stuff.
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,All those little spaces they can get into and stuff.
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,I gue- I gue-.
52_CIND,Probably.
52_DARL,It'd be a good place for em to get out of the sun or get out of the cold.
52_CIND,Yeah. That's true.
52_DARL,"But, evidently, that one house, I- I went by it, about a year after that. And, it was still the same way. Worse. Worse."
52_CIND,Hm. Yeah.
52_DARL,More things.
52_CIND,It gets...
52_DARL,But.
52_CIND,I don't know.
52_DARL,"Uh, I guess, uh, I wish I could think of the name of that other program. See this one guy at the store had a house, that he bought, and then he couldn't afford the house payments anymore, so, he got with one of these, um, support things and, uh, like HUD, and I can't think of the name of it, and they guaranteed him, a residence."
52_CIND,Section eight are you talking.
52_DARL,Section eight. Yeah.
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"And, it worked out good for him, otherwise he would've lost the house. Eventually he got it back. You know, he took it off that and, he got his finances back in order, so he didn't lose his house. So it worked out good for him on that, and he said, the people that, all the people that had rented his house, he said Section eight, That uh, Section eight people kept up good with it. And checked on the people. But on this other program, it didn't look like they did."
52_CIND,Yeah.
52_DARL,"So, anyway."
52_CIND,Hunh.
52_DARL,But.
52_CIND,So what did you get.
52_DARL,And now how did we get on that.
52_CIND,Hunh.
52_DARL,I don't know how we got on that...
52_ANDR,<NONVERBAL>
52_CIND,I can't understand you.
52_DARL,I don't know how we got on that...
52_ANDR,<NONVERBAL>
52_CIND,"No, I I don't know... oh I. We were talking about books. I don't know. How we jumped to that."
52_DARL,Uh.
52_CIND,"But, what was I gonna, oh um, ask you, What'd you get for Christmas..."
52_DARL,"Oh, some earrings from Brenda and Danny, a little Christmas statue from Brenda and Danny, that, it's um, I don't know, ceramic, or, what it's made out of, and it's real cute, it's got a, little boy, with a deer, and Santa Claus. And until Brenda pointed it out to me."
52_CIND,Hunh.
52_DARL,"I didn't realize it. It looks like the little boy brought the deer, to Santa Claus, for Santa Claus to fix its. Had the deer with its uh leg up, and Santa Claus was bandaging it."
52_CIND,"Aw, Oh..."
52_DARL,<NONVERBAL>
52_CIND,<NONVERBAL>
52_DARL,So.
52_CIND,That's cute.

52_DARL,Oh yeah. Helen Steiner Rice.
52_CIND,Steiner Rice.
52_DARL,Steiner Rice.
52_CIND,"Yeah. I had n-. I had never heard of her. But that doesn't mean much, but uh, they were nice verses. Yeah. I kinda liked her."
52_DARL,Mhm.
