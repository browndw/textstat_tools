15_JOAN,Hunh.
15_KEN,I'd like to go.
15_JOAN,"It's an interesting thing though, because, um, I'm wondering, you know, since it is such... um, it's restricted, you have to go through Mexico."
15_KEN,No. I don't think so.
15_JOAN,Isn't Nicaragua one of the things you.
15_KEN,No.
15_JOAN,Places you can't go.
15_KEN,I don't think so. No.
15_JOAN,I think it is.
15_KEN,"We have. No, I don't think so. We have f- f-. Technically speaking, full diplomatic relations with Nicaragua."
15_JOAN,Oh yeah.
15_KEN,"Yeah, they have an, an ambassador, and, you know an American ambassador there."
15_JOAN,I... then why does everybody always have to go through Mexico.
15_KEN,Who... like a nest of CIA spies. That's just... there... there isn't a direct transportation... but there n-.
15_JOAN,I thought.
15_KEN,It's not.
15_JOAN,"No, but I thought it w-."
15_KEN,It's not like going to Cuba. Where they have to make connections through Mexico because.
15_JOAN,Oh. I knew someone who went to Cuba...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,And had to go.
15_KEN,Yeah.
15_JOAN,Make connections through Mexico.
15_KEN,That's because it's illegal for Americans to travel to Cuba...
15_JOAN,But I wonder whether this... uh It is.
15_KEN,Yeah. It is... <XX>.
15_JOAN,Oh yeah. Just like Lebanon just became.
15_LENO,How long.
15_JOAN,They say Lebanon is actually.
15_LENO,How long's.
15_JOAN,They-... it d- just became illegal... and- and- I-... you know.
15_KEN,For a few years.
15_LENO,How long has it been illegal.
15_JOAN,"Libya, too. Isn't Libya as well. There's quite a few pla-. Libya."
15_KEN,There's only a... uh there's only a handful of places.
15_LENO,How long has it been illegal for Americans to...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_LENO,Go to Cuba.
15_KEN,Well.
15_JOAN,Since the fif-.
15_KEN,It was illegal.
15_JOAN,Since the fifties.
15_KEN,It was illegal.
15_JOAN,Or the sixties.
15_KEN,"It was illegal, you know, from like the time of Cath-... the Castro revolution, up until, I think the early seventies, the Supreme Court, overturned uh travel restrictions, on the um, on the passport, and said that the government couldn't, uh really, permit you from going anywh-... uh, prevent you from going anywhere, And then, tha-..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"That changed again, a few years later they passed some laws, or something like that, which did enable the government to, to do um, visa res- restrictions, and, I think Cuba, and North Korea."
15_JOAN,Now Lebanon.
15_KEN,"And now Lebanon, and Libya."
15_JOAN,Unhunh.
15_KEN,"Are the only places that uh, maybe North-... maybe Vietnam also..."
15_JOAN,<XX>.
15_KEN,Where you...
15_JOAN,<XX>.
15_KEN,"You're, supposedly, not able to use your passport to go to... but, you really. I mean you can."
15_JOAN,They know.
15_KEN,You know.
15_JOAN,"The thing is, what I'm wondering."
15_KEN,"You can, like people go to Cuba all the time."
15_JOAN,"What I'm wondering is, people that go to Nicara-."
15_KEN,And less o-... less often to Nicar-.
15_JOAN,Doesn't the State Department.
15_KEN,"To North-... to Vietnam, and North Korea."
15_JOAN,"Wouldn't the State Department know, everybody that went to Nicaragua."
15_KEN,But people go to Cuba all the time... P Sure.
15_JOAN,Wouldn't they know. And that's what's sort of worrisome...
15_KEN,<XX> is b- crawling with the CIA.
15_JOAN,"That's what's worri- worrisome, but that I'm sure, if they. I'm sure they have Jessie on a list anyway... but."
15_KEN,"Oh, yeah."
15_JOAN,"I mean, but I'm saying, well he's the only existing live member of the Peace and Freedom Party left..."
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,"You know, but, but he's a."
15_KEN,The only one under the age of sixty.
15_JOAN,"Yeah, I know. And it's really funny..."
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,"That I would think that they would have, a... a thing on you, they would actually, possibly even keep an eye on you, or, or watch you, I don't know how many Americans have been to Nicaragua."
15_KEN,"Oh, I doubt it."
15_JOAN,How many.
15_KEN,"No, plenty..."

15_KEN,"Actually, probably during the Spanish period, and or, during the Mexican period, I don't know and..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"But the whole town still has the old Mexican plaza, and the Mexican governor, general's house, was right there and, and the church."
15_JOAN,And that's like the main street.
15_KEN,And that kind of thing is.
15_JOAN,Uh you know...
15_KEN,"Uh you know, right in the center of Sonoma..."
15_JOAN,Sonoma of all places.
15_KEN,"Yeah, so you can go up there and, p see old California, and drink wine."
15_LENO,"That's interesting... s-... um, did you ever find out what disease you had."
15_KEN,"No. I've went to the doctor, and he- uh did a blood test."

15_JOAN,"Oh, you didn't go to him..."
15_KEN,"Um, no. He just di- did a blood test, and said, yeah, well, your b-... your blood's all shot, and you have the liver of a ninety-year-old, um."
15_JOAN,Do you drink.
15_KEN,And il-... and I... and I think.

15_KEN,V- um.
15_JOAN,Virus.
15_KEN,"Virus, like, uh, he named like half a dozen viruses, and said, Ah, I could do some more tests, and find out which one, but, by the time we got the test results back, you'd probably be over with it anyway, so why bother..."
15_JOAN,He is like that though... that's his attitude.
15_KEN,That wasn't Deutsch.
15_JOAN,That's what I don't like about him. Oh. That wasn't Deutsch. That sounds like Deutsch.

15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"Look, there he goes again, He's trying uh."

15_JOAN,"Look, watch watch. Watch him flutter."
15_KEN,And.
15_JOAN,"I love the little fl-... have you seen it flutter. It's really amazing. And yet she's not running from him. I remember at the beginning, when he started his courtship thing, she was frantically running around, like trying to get away from him. And he was biting her."
15_KEN,Yeah.
15_JOAN,And stuff like that.
15_KEN,Now uh...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"I don't really know, I mean I haven't. I haven't s- bothered to sit around and catalog, what they're doing, you know but, this I think is fairly light. I think this is... he's just crying to like."
15_JOAN,Could be foreplay.
15_KEN,Check her out. This is... this is he's checking her out...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,I don't even think it's gotten to the foreplay yet.

15_KEN,K- shining him on...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"She's not really, but she's not showing a lot of interest, either. I think when he starts biting her."
15_JOAN,His tail is curved like that. Does it always get curved like that.
15_KEN,Yeah. Yeah.
15_JOAN,You know.
15_KEN,I don't know...
15_JOAN,And sometimes it's straight.
15_KEN,"Yeah. I think when he starts biting her, that's when he's."
15_JOAN,Do you know.
15_KEN,"He's a lot more interested, and so is she."
15_JOAN,"That when we bought him, when we bought him..."
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,He was larger than her. Now look at them.
15_LENO,She's a glutton.
15_JOAN,He was larger than her.
15_KEN,Uh.
15_JOAN,Remember that.
15_KEN,She's like twice as big as he is now.

15_KEN,Yeah.
15_JOAN,"It does-... it can't move. It can't swim, it can't do anything. What are you gonna do when it gets this big. You're gonna have to like, transfer it to a bathtub, You're gonna have to have a."
15_KEN,Mm.
15_JOAN,"Like an old, old bathtubs aren't hard, aren't hard to find."
15_KEN,Ah p-...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"I give her a qu- swift kick into the LA river, at that point."
15_LENO,"Oh, come now."
15_JOAN,Ke n.
15_LENO,"Ken, you would not."
15_KEN,You kidding me.
15_JOAN,How could you abandon her about twenty y-.
15_KEN,She alr-... she already eats me out of house and home.
15_JOAN,Yes she does.
15_LENO,"Oh, <XX>."
15_JOAN,But you know.
15_LENO,A few worms.
15_JOAN,"When she gets that big-, Oh a few worms, when she gets that big, she'll need a vat of worms. And they're expensive."
15_LENO,"Well uh, you'll provide them. You'll have all your investments."
15_JOAN,You know what.
15_LENO,"And, she'll be supporting you."
15_JOAN,You know.
15_KEN,"No, yeah. I'm gonna b-. What am I gonna... what is it that I'm gonna be invested."
15_JOAN,You know what though Ken...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,"You said as they get older, they z-... they eat more vegetable matter."
15_KEN,Yeah. So I'll have to b- feed her.
15_JOAN,And grapes.
15_KEN,I'll have to feed her heads of lettuce.
15_LENO,Will the protein needs go down.
15_KEN,At a time...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_LENO,Or.
15_KEN,I guess.
15_JOAN,"No, you know what he's."
15_KEN,That's what I've read.
15_JOAN,"He's such a softie, he. You know what they do eat. That he refuses, which would be easy to feed, cheap."
15_KEN,I'm not gonna give them goldfish.
15_JOAN,"Live, they love to eat..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,They love... they only eat live food.
15_LENO,Sadistic.
15_KEN,I'm not gonna k give them...
15_JOAN,<XX>.
15_LENO,It's against his his his philosophy of life.
15_JOAN,I'd love to see it...
15_LENO,<XX>.
15_JOAN,I'd love to see him chase and eat up a goldfish.
15_LENO,"Yeah, a Roman circus in your tank."
15_JOAN,And they won't let me see it.
15_KEN,I'm not...
15_LENO,<XX>.
15_KEN,"It just, I mean the idea of dropping a little goldfish into there..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"And then like, you know, watching it like go- like."
15_JOAN,It's neat.
15_KEN,"You know, like pick goop off the bottom, and do its little goldfish business, you know, and then all of a sudden have a turtle come over..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"And take a big hunk out of it. You know, and then that gets a little shock <XX>."
15_JOAN,They won't eat it... the thing is it.
15_KEN,You know.
15_JOAN,"The thing it uh will actually be half swimming, and half not."
15_KEN,Uh oh.
15_JOAN,And they take bites out of it.
15_KEN,"Well <XX>, you know they take bites."
15_JOAN,They d-... it's not a whole thing.
15_KEN,"You know and, and sometimes they can get the whole thing down at once, other times they just like eat the tail."
15_JOAN,They don't quite make it.
15_KEN,"And a piece of the fin, and, and then the, you know, the goldfish manages to get away and, flutters around the tank trying to get away from him."
15_JOAN,Oh.
15_KEN,Ha- half gone.
15_JOAN,Oh Ken.
15_KEN,I don't have the heart for that kind of thing.
15_JOAN,"When you say it that way, I don't think I could stand it eith-. Well you know what I was doing, is for about two months, when I had that snake in my classroom, I would once a week, it would be a whole ritual. Tuesday. The kids knew. Tuesday, we would all sit around the rug, we'd put the snake, we- we named it Sissy, and we'd put, we'd s- put Sissy, like right in front of all the kids, and I would get- buy a feeder locally, and I would bring it in, and I would put it in the little thing, and we would watch the snake, hunt, you know, we would watch Sissy hunt the goldfish. And the go-... and the snake, and it was so h-..."
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_LENO,Your snake was eating goldfish.
15_JOAN,Yeah.
15_KEN,Mhm.
15_JOAN,It would l- eat only live things. Th- that's the only way they feed. You have to buy em feeder fish.
15_KEN,"Yeah they won't eat uh, some k-..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,Some kinds of snakes won't eat.
15_JOAN,They'll eat crickets.
15_KEN,Uh eat dead things.
15_JOAN,And things like that.
15_LENO,"Oh yeah, so you put little goldfish down in the box."
15_JOAN,I would put it.
15_LENO,And then it would.
15_KEN,But they'd put it in a little.
15_JOAN,"No, No... in a bowl."
15_KEN,In like a little cup a little water.
15_JOAN,"And, cause it'll only eat it live. And so the snake, The bowl was about yea big, you know, and then the snake would start to... it would see it. And it would start to do this whole little dance. It would start circling the bowl, and wrapping itself, and it would get faster and faster. Then it would start s-... it would start moving, at the same pace that the snake would b-... that the fish would be swimming. And it would start, kinda following it. And going fast and fast, It would be like this little whirlwind. You know. And all of a sudden it would go chk. And you know what's so funny. The snake, was v-... th- they're v-... they're very b-... th-. I guess they're very bright about goldfish. Cause it..."
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,"It would rarely get it, it would rarely get the fish, it- w-... by the fin. It would almost always get it by the head, because it was streamlined. Cause it would, it it would get it by the tail, then the fins would all get... it would be hard to swallow. Do you know what I mean."
15_LENO,Mhm.
15_JOAN,It would get all fluffed out.
15_LENO,Right.
15_JOAN,"And um, the kids loved it."
15_KEN,Well.
15_JOAN,It was their favorite time of the week. They lo-... and... except.
15_KEN,Blood-thirsty little bastards.
15_JOAN,I had one little girl. I had one little girl named Ana Mehia...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,And she was this sensitive sweet little girl from uh Guatemala. Who was. Actually her language was great. And every time. You know what she would do-. The first time she did. She- she did. She crossed herself. She did the cross... for the fish.
15_KEN,For the Fish.
15_JOAN,"And I asked her, why did you do that."
15_KEN,Little fishy.
15_JOAN,"And she goes, so that the fish'll go to heaven."
15_KEN,"Aw, wasn't that sweet."
15_JOAN,"And then, from that point-... and then she cried, And then from that point on, everybody would be sitting there, looking at the fish anxiously, and I would have to tell em to sit down, cause you know, uh others can't see."
15_KEN,Calm down.
15_JOAN,Calm down...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,"She, would turn around, so she'd be facing the wall, so she couldn't watch."
15_KEN,"Well, a very sensitive little kid."
15_JOAN,"This seven-year-old kid. And she wouldn't wa-. And she was... it was like, talk about, you know i-, not influenced by peer pressure, cause all the kids were excited, and and she knew in a sense, that she was s- kinda supposed to be excited, cause all of the other kids, and she no, She was-... and it's really, really, really interesting. You know."
15_LENO,I wonder what her personal history <XX> <XX>.
15_JOAN,"And, and then we."
15_KEN,Yeah. Oh.
15_JOAN,"You know, we drew."
15_KEN,I know.
15_JOAN,"What was so funny is, you know, we had like language lessons from it."
15_KEN,Uh.
15_JOAN,"We wrote about it. You know, and they would do one or two sentences... about it, and a lot of the kids mentioned Ana. And. Y-... the snake-. Sissy s- uh ate the fish, and Ana cried..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,That was like their...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,A lot of them did those sentences.
15_LENO,Great...
15_JOAN,"And it was really fu-... and then, a lot of them would draw a picture of Ana, you know, they'd... they'd do their sentences, and then they'd draw a picture of Ana... um crying."
15_LENO,And what did she write.
15_JOAN,Um.
15_LENO,Sissy ate the fish and I cried.
15_JOAN,Uh I-... uh...
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,"Ki-. I don't remember what she wrote, but it was something similar like that. It was something like, the f-... the ate the goldfish and stuff, And I wouldn't... you know, I'd. I would have it from the morning. Cause I would pick it up in the morning, or I'd pick it up the n-... that's what I'd do, I'd pick it up the night before. Like, if it w-... if we're feeding it, I would pick it up Monday, I would take it home. And that was the worst part. I would take it home, and I would like put it in, I would leave it in its plastic bag, put it in a bunch of water... in the sink... and I wouldn't go near the sink... cause I didn't wanna look at this thing. I didn't wanna get friendly with this fish. You know, and then I would take it in, I would t- put it in its bag, and I would put it in a paper bag. And so I wouldn't look at it. And I would put it like over by the sink in the classroom, all day-, you know, until it was feeding time. And I wouldn't look at it, and I wouldn't let the kids look at it. Only when it was put into the bowl. Cause I just, it was, I was the worst."
15_LENO,You didn't wanna get.
15_JOAN,"I was going, ew, ew. You know like th-."
15_KEN,Listen to her.
15_JOAN,It was really.
15_KEN,"F-... you know, five minutes ago, she said she really would love to see the turtles eat a goldfish."
15_JOAN,Uh.
15_KEN,Now she's saying how it was the worst.
15_JOAN,No no no but...
15_LENO,<XX>...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,It was just the idea of it...
15_KEN,<NONVERBAL>
15_JOAN,It's interesting... it's neat.
15_KEN,Yeah... it's interesting but.
15_JOAN,"You know, to see it... but but but to actually see it..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>

15_JOAN,"Is, is not as uh."
15_KEN,I remember once...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"When I was a kid, it, r it's really stuck in my mind..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"Uh Uh, I went..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"I used to, l- um, go to an elementary school, that had like a p- a pet shop... right around the corner from it. And I used to go into the pet stores and look at all the b-, the animals."
15_JOAN,Didn't you guys go to the same elementary school.
15_KEN,"And the fish and stuff all the time. Los Feliz. Anyway, um, uh."
15_LENO,Where was y- el-... where was the pet.
15_KEN,"Right around the corner, where... th you know where the bank is... the Security Bank. And there's all those little shops."
15_JOAN,Unhunh.
15_KEN,"There's like Tamara's, that sandwich shop..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,And stuff...
15_LENO,On Hollywood.
15_KEN,Um...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,Hunh.
15_JOAN,No on Vermont.
15_LENO,On Hol-.
15_KEN,"It was on Vermont. On Vermont, like w- maybe, six shops up from, from uh um, Hollywood, or Prospect... rather. Um, there was a little pet shop called Pandora's Pets..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,When I was in elementary school.
15_JOAN,Pandor's pets.
15_KEN,"Anyway, I remember they had a, they had this fish in there called an Oscar. And they are these like, they are these really."
15_JOAN,"I remember-, yeah th- they're big."
15_KEN,They're these big gnarly suckers. They're like um.
15_JOAN,"Yeah, I remember what they look like."
15_KEN,"They're like m-... f-. I don't know, six or eight inches."
15_JOAN,Big eyes.
15_KEN,"And they've got, they only eat like other fish. They eat like small fish..."
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"And they eat like, you know like goldfish. And I guess goldfish or guppies, get the brunt of everything. Poor guys. They're like the, you know, they're like the cattle of the animal world. They're bred only to feed other things."
15_JOAN,"Yeah, feeds. Yeah, they're feeders."
15_KEN,"Anyway, anyway so."
15_JOAN,"They're nothing but tanks of feeders, in every pet shop."
15_KEN,"I remember w- watching them feed the Oscar once, when I was a kid. And they dropped in the goldfish, and I don't think I'd ever seen it before. Maybe I did, I don't remember. But this time particularly sticks in my mind. He drops the goldfish into the tank, and the goldfish goes and sw- swims around, minding his own little business, eating glop and all that shit, you know, that fish do, and the Oscar sneaks up behind it, and opens its mouth. And like creates a vacuum kinda thing cause..."
15_JOAN,Oh my God.
15_KEN,"You got this huge mouth, that sucks the goldfish in."
15_JOAN,"Oh my God, right from the water."
15_KEN,"Yeah and, and then."
15_JOAN,And it doesn't even <XX>.
15_KEN,"And then uh, But the goldfish got stuck... half-way into his mouth."
15_JOAN,It went the wrong way.
15_KEN,"No, it was going."
15_JOAN,Fin first.
15_KEN,It was going.
15_JOAN,Mouth first.
15_KEN,"Well it was going, it went tail first."
15_JOAN,That's the problem.
15_KEN,I guess that's the wrong way.
15_JOAN,That's the problem.
15_KEN,I don't know. Anyway...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"So, you got this Oscar there, swimming around in the tank."
15_JOAN,I learned a lot from that snake.
15_KEN,With like...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,A goldfish...
15_JOAN,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"Sticking out of his mouth, you know, the the head of a goldfish, so you could see the little goldfish's eyes, and his little mouth going, g bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, and the Oscar's there swimming around, and you could tell the little goldfish, I mean they don't have what you would call, massively expressive faces..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"But I think it was worried. You know, it g- it's going, bloop bloop bloop bloop, and it's got these like wide-open eyes, you know..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,I was just imagining what was going through its little mind...
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"As the Oscar was swimming around, frantically trying to dislodge it, so it could swallow it..."
15_LENO,<NONVERBAL>
15_KEN,"You know. And um, finally it d- did manage to, you know, v- like loosen it."
15_LENO,Spit it out.
15_KEN,Uh I don't know- remember if it spat it out or.
15_LENO,Cack it up.
15_KEN,"Or what. But it managed to like uh, you know."
15_LENO,Dislodge it.
