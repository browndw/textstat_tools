03_MARI,Okay.
03_ROY,"Do you have a particular, um, use for the red peppers..."
03_PETE,<XX> <XX>.
03_ROY,As opposed to the yellow or green peppers.
03_MARI,"No no, it was all salad peppers."
03_ROY,It's all salad peppers.
03_MARI,Mhm.
03_ROY,In that case I will use a yellow pepper for this evening.
03_MARI,"Oh, fabulous. Peter..."
03_ROY,<XX>.
03_MARI,Would you like to string the beans.
03_PETE,What can I do. Sure...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,"Oh, it smells like that stuff."
03_MARI,"I know. It's kind of smelly, isn't it."
03_PETE,Mhm...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,But I got it at a reputable market.
03_ROY,"Well let's see, a three-person salad bowl."
03_PETE,These aren't particularly stringy.
03_MARI,Hunh.
03_PETE,They aren't particularly stringy.
03_MARI,Oh. Then just snap em.
03_ROY,That probably looks like a three-person salad bowl.
03_PETE,"I'll just and put em, and put them."
03_ROY,Hunh.
03_MARI,Man that's a big hunk of fish.
03_PETE,Where do you want em put.
03_MARI,"Shit, it's a huge."
03_PETE,"Are they just going on that, or <XX>."
03_MARI,"Uh, you wanna put em in a colander, and then wash em. There's a colander. Oh. It's gone. Oh here it is. Um, around the corner there. I got fishy hands. My God these are enormous."
03_PETE,Yeah...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"Oh. Oh I see, we have two big ones. Instead of, good. Good good. Okay, now. How much. Do you guys each want like, half of that."
03_PETE,Sure.
03_MARI,Or <XX> will you eat more. Or if you'll eat.
03_PETE,Nah.
03_MARI,If you'll eat more than that...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Then I'll cook the whole thing. If not then I'll make ceviche. With the leftovers. What do you think...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,This is a big fucking fish. Roy...
03_ROY,"<XX>, What what what."
03_MARI,"Do you want half... half of one of these, or more than that."
03_ROY,I could eat one of those.
03_MARI,You could.
03_PETE,Hm.
03_ROY,"Well, but I won't..."
03_PETE,Then I guess.
03_ROY,I mean.
03_MARI,Okay...
03_PETE,Divide it in half.
03_ROY,Well don't.
03_MARI,Then I'll.
03_ROY,"Y-. What you oughta do though Mar, cook all the fish."
03_MARI,Hm.
03_ROY,"Cause... well, we won't use it, if you don't cook it. Now."
03_MARI,Well I was gonna make ceviche with the leftovers.
03_ROY,"Oh alright, that sounds good."
03_MARI,So you can eat about that much Peter.
03_PETE,Which size.
03_ROY,There's a bad smell in here.
03_MARI,That size.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_ROY,Hmm.
03_MARI,There is.
03_PETE,I could. But I. I'm. I'm also capable of eating lots of stuff.
03_ROY,No it's the smell of fish. The smell.
03_MARI,"Oh okay, well let's make the whole thing then."
03_ROY,"Of fish, is in, the fridge..."
03_MARI,<XX> <XX> microwave... Oh God...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Okay. Um...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"Now. Ah. Okay, we're gonna have like dietetic style fish..."
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Hope that's acceptable.
03_ROY,You'll probably want me to wash this stuff.
03_MARI,Silly me. Do you want. You could use the lettuce washer...
03_PETE,<XX>.
03_MARI,Cause Pete's using the colander.
03_ROY,Where's the lettuce washer.
03_MARI,"You know, the salad spinner thing... <XX>, Creole seafood seasoning..."
03_ROY,<XX> <XX>.
03_MARI,See how hard we work.
03_PETE,That's right.
03_MARI,To feed our guests.
03_PETE,I'm really impressed.
03_ROY,Where is that salad spinner. Here it is.
03_MARI,A dollar ninety-eight.
03_ROY,And possibly the most spurious device ever invented.
03_MARI,Oh I think it they're great. Do you have a salad spinner.
03_PETE,No.
03_MARI,They're cool.
03_ROY,"Is this like something you had when you were young, in your own family."
03_MARI,No. It's brand new. Oh shit.
03_PETE,"Yeah, I don't think they ever... did they actually exist back then."
03_MARI,Hey bud... <XX>.
03_ROY,"No, and they probably didn't have to wash their salads back then, because they didn't know what was on them..."
03_MARI,Yeah. They weren't crawling with disgusting pesticides.
03_ROY,Conceptual pesticides.
03_MARI,Whatever.
03_ROY,Pesticides of the mind.
03_MARI,What should I fry this fish in.
03_ROY,"Could I beg your indulgence, my dear. That I might slip in past you here."
03_MARI,"You can. Sure. Okay, so did we decide we do or do not want potatoes."
03_ROY,I think potatoes are excessive. I think we have enough food here.
03_MARI,Peter.
03_PETE,"Um, that's fine."
03_MARI,Okay.
03_PETE,No potatoes.
03_MARI,We have... um.
03_PETE,We're having like salad and fish.
03_MARI,"Unhunh, and gre- green beans."
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,"We can make um, garlic bread or something."
03_ROY,"Oh, that sounds fun."
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,Okay.
03_PETE,"Yeah, we could have a little garlic bread."
03_MARI,I have the ideal makings for garlic bread. Right here.
03_ROY,"Garlic, bread, and butter."
03_MARI,"Right. Well actually I have Trader Joe's, whipped garlic bread spread."
03_ROY,Oh boy.
03_MARI,Oo...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,"So, we can dispense with the garlic and the butter."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,Right. It's all.
03_PETE,That goes right along with the-... the Cajun spice mix.
03_MARI,I know.
03_PETE,And.
03_MARI,"I know. It's just like, well, we could've gone out."
03_PETE,Hm.
03_MARI,"But, uh I wanted it to be home made..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,You know...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,"Right, flavors of the evening."
03_MARI,Now it will be the spray on.
03_ROY,Just add food...
03_PETE,Spray on...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Spray on olive oil. Oh boy...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Woo...
03_PETE,Is it really.
03_MARI,"Uh, yes. It's uh... it's really icky."
03_PETE,How bizarre.
03_MARI,"But, I'm gonna cut this up, so I can fry it."
03_PETE,"S-. How come like, the bread crumbs weren't already attached to the fish, or the pan..."
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,Or something...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Well I probably could've bought it that way...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"But I-... you know, I said, I want it to be homemade. You know, something special."
03_PETE,Well at least they are uh like already breaded.
03_ROY,Hm.
03_PETE,I mean crumbed and in the jar.
03_ROY,They're working on breeding pre-breaded red snapper...
03_PETE,<XX>.
03_MARI,Yeah...
03_ROY,On fish farms...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,"Have you heard about these horrific uh new genetic developments, in in um food livestock."
03_PETE,Y no. Like what.
03_ROY,"Like they're, they're trying to breed, ho ho, they're trying to breed like a forty foot long tube chicken."
03_MARI,No. You mean so that they can go right from that to Chicken McNuggets.
03_ROY,"They're like, they're like. Yeah, and it has..."
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,"It has n-... it has no, basically no body bones except a spine."
03_MARI,Yuck.
03_ROY,"To con- uh vey the nerves, from one end to another."
03_MARI,"Oh no, who's doing this."
03_ROY,This is like.
03_MARI,UC Davis.
03_ROY,This is like some kind of horrific nightmare. I read about this.
03_PETE,This.
03_ROY,This is tube chickens.
03_PETE,That's horrible.
03_MARI,That is the worst.
03_PETE,That's really true. I.
03_ROY,And it's just awful. Who wants to eat it.
03_MARI,I think I'll dip these in egg.
03_ROY,Course.
03_PETE,"Yeah. You know, the early man probably said the same thing about the first domestic chicken..."
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,You know.
03_MARI,"Can you imagine, they're taking this beautiful jungle fowl, and they're leaving it in a box. That's gross."
03_ROY,Right.
03_MARI,"Oh, I wonder if it's this horrible."
03_ROY,Is there something fishy that smells.
03_MARI,No.
03_ROY,"No, I- I think it's just residual, um."
03_MARI,"Residual fish smell, from the smelly fish."
03_ROY,Fish smell from the potent red snapper.
03_MARI,"Well, it'll be unpotent in a minute. Not to worry. Let me see. What was I in here for, there's nothing worse than staring like a dope at your own refrigerator. Um, oh an egg. God damn it, what'd you do. You son of a bitch..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,I threw a green pepper down your blouse.
03_MARI,You threw a green pepper down my shirt.
03_ROY,I thought it was funny.
03_MARI,Hilarious.
03_ROY,I'm laughing...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,I got quite a giggle out of it...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,Um.
03_MARI,Um.
03_ROY,Did you dispense with the uh tomatoes that I had sitting in here. In a fit of household efficiency.
03_MARI,These guys.
03_ROY,Those. Yes...
03_MARI,"<XX>, okay, egg. One egg will do. So my mom didn't catch any fish."
03_ROY,Mhm.
03_MARI,Up north she said. Rotten luck.
03_PETE,"Where were they fishing. Like in lakes, or."
03_MARI,Um.
03_PETE,Rivers.
03_MARI,I think.
03_PETE,Or what.
03_MARI,"Um, at the mouth of rivers, on the coast of Oregon."
03_PETE,Oh.
03_ROY,Oh my. Oops. Too late.
03_MARI,They have some.
03_PETE,"So like what are they catching, salmon and stuff..."
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,Or what.
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_PETE,Unhhunh.
03_MARI,"And some guy who-... who knows a good thing when he's on to it, calls them up."
03_PETE,I see.
03_MARI,"And says, oh. The fish are running, don't you want to come up here, and blah blah blah b-."
03_ROY,And pay me zillions of dollars to.
03_MARI,You know.
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,Pay me.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"Pay me, you know, eighty dollars a day to run my boat."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,Catch fabulous salmon. And they have it canned.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"You know, they eat it, when they're up there, and I guess they have some frozen."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,But they have it canned and.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"Put it in our stockings, for Christmas."
03_PETE,Aw.
03_ROY,Isn't that great.
03_MARI,It's nice for them. They have some recreation with it.
03_PETE,But no salmon in your stockings this year. Hunh.
03_ROY,Spend their va-.
03_MARI,"Well, they have already done it. So."
03_PETE,Oh.
03_MARI,"I mean, this was, another trip."
03_PETE,This is the next trip.
03_MARI,"In fact, they were supposed to go up in um, more, you know, environmental thing. They were supposed to go up at the end of August. When they usually run, and, fish weren't running this year, you know, it's like everywhere. Nothing's doing what it's supposed to, anymore, anywhere."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_MARI,That's why that whole mountain climbing expedition was screwy.
03_PETE,What mountain climbing expedition was that... <XX>.
03_MARI,The one that we were part of.
03_ROY,The expedition we went on in Nepal.
03_PETE,Oh that.
03_MARI,In Nepal.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,Um.
03_PETE,What was the problem.
03_ROY,Was supposed to be.
03_MARI,Supposed to be perfect weather.
03_ROY,"Right in between the. Yeah, perfect weather, and all that stuff."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,And they ended up getting early winter storms. Or late monsoon storms. Or whatever.
03_MARI,"Yeah, whatever."
03_ROY,And that's.
03_MARI,It was atypical weather.
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"You know. Everywhere we've been, in the past several years, everybody's talking about how, the weather just isn't normal."
03_PETE,"That's true. That's definitely been the case in Indonesia, for quite a few years."
03_MARI,Mhm. Really.
03_ROY,Really.
03_PETE,"Yeah. Well like, when I was living there for the couple of years, it was... the rainy season was all off, you know, it rained during the dry season, and was dry during the rainy season."
03_MARI,Oh really.
03_PETE,"And stuff like that, yeah."
03_MARI,Gee.
03_PETE,And really really dry. They were having a drought while I was there.
03_ROY,"Yeah, I don't know, I mean. I- I don't know if our drought here will ever break. I wonder if this is just isn't."
03_MARI,This is it.
03_PETE,Hm.
03_ROY,The new weather for southern California.
03_PETE,"Well they... they claim that there's these cycles, and that we're in the the middle of a normal cycle. I don't know how true that is."
03_MARI,Well.
03_PETE,Thanks.
03_MARI,"I r- I really. We read this great book. Called, The End of Nature."
03_PETE,Ew. Sounds wonderful.
03_MARI,"By this guy, this, um, you know."
03_ROY,Bill McKibben.
03_MARI,"Twenty-eight-year-old, Harvard guy."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,"Who lives out in the woods, a la Thoreau."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_MARI,"Anyway, smart. And uh, it's called, yeah. It's called The End of Nature, and it's just really a scary book. You know. There's no natural world left."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,All the natural world was gone in nineteen seventy-five.
03_ROY,His premise is basically this.
03_MARI,And now <XX>.
03_ROY,"That, um, as soon as the world hit a point, where there was no more objectively pristine land."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,"When, you know, they found pollution on top of Mount Everest."
03_PETE,Right... mhm.
03_ROY,And at the very bottom of the ocean.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"Well, that's it."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,Man has had some effect. On the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"So in principle, the concept of nature, as a system inside of which man lives, is over."
03_PETE,"Mhm, Right."
03_ROY,"And then, in practice, since then, which was fifteen years ago."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"Man has had such dramatic impact, on what we used to think of as nature, that, that the only way to coexist with nature-. It's no longer, nature, the quasi religious, overarching, ordering principle."
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,Inside of which mankind lives.
03_MARI,Wordsworthian nature.
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"And uh-, you know, w- a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force, over and above ourselves, to order the universe. Forget all that."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_MARI,Woo that's spicy.
03_ROY,It's now.
03_MARI,Shit...
03_ROY,"You know, the world is gonna be kept in order by the same people that brought you..."
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,You know...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,The atomic bomb.
03_PETE,Right...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,And...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,All that stuff. Right.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,Which just doesn't sound like a very practical proposal.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,Wow.
03_ROY,"You know, the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in Europe and America..."
03_PETE,<XX>.
03_MARI,And the dodo.
03_ROY,Are now entrusted with.
03_PETE,Maintaining what's there...
03_ROY,<XX>.
03_MARI,The rest of the natural world.
03_ROY,"Maintaining the entire globe, for the rest of time."
03_PETE,Mhm. Right.
03_ROY,Not likely.
03_MARI,Mhm.
03_ROY,"So, that was his basic premise. And then he goes on, for the rest of book, to absolutely."
03_MARI,Then it gets really depressing.
03_ROY,Heartlessly.
03_PETE,Oh good...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,Oh gee.
03_ROY,Heartlessly debunk.
03_MARI,"You haven't heard nothing, yet."
03_ROY,"All of the, you know, watery-eyed, new age, uh, various theories, of."
03_MARI,"Gaia, and all that stuff."
03_ROY,Of how it might not be that way.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"You know, so."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,"Forget it, forget it, forget it."
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,We're fucked.
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_MARI,"Well I read it in the New Yorker, and I thought, oh no, one of those New Yorker articles, you know, yuck."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,"And I. It was really. I read the whole thing, which is pretty rare. Well my my."
03_ROY,"So I mean, but his premise is not that mankind can't survive on Earth."
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,His question is.
03_MARI,It's just it's a whole different earth.
03_ROY,Can mankind spiritually survive.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"In a metaphysical world, in which it is patently obvious, that man is the highest active principle."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"You know. Outside of, completely faith-based belief in God, you know, which is, uh irrespective of any relationship to nature."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"There is now, absolutely nothing, in the world, to which we are beholden. And he w-... his question was, what impact is this gonna have, on the."
03_MARI,Sort of fucks up the animists.
03_ROY,Cultural growth...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,Of... of the human species.
03_MARI,Mhm.
03_ROY,Do we even want this.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,Do we want to be the guy in charge of the world.
03_MARI,Unhunh.
03_PETE,"On the other hand, isn't he saying its too late."
03_ROY,Well he is kind of saying its too late.
03_PETE,So.
03_ROY,This is why its such a depressing book.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"He's saying, we already did it, and we haven't even thought about."
03_MARI,So much for culture.
03_ROY,Whether we wanted to do it or not...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,This is typical.
03_PETE,Yeah. You know.
03_ROY,"And... and then it gets down to s-... you know, I mean that brings into play, other people's remarks like, you know, the... w- it's all fine and good for us in this generation."
03_MARI,Let's cook those <XX>.
03_PETE,So like.
03_ROY,To talk about saving the whale.
03_PETE,Rinse them or something. Wash them.
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_PETE,Did-.
03_MARI,Wash them.
03_PETE,"Did you want them broken smaller, or."
03_MARI,Oh I think they're good like that.
03_PETE,Okay.
03_MARI,Are they good.
03_PETE,That's good. Alright.
03_MARI,Yeah. Yeah.
03_ROY,"You know, saving the whale, or saving uh the polar bear."
03_PETE,Right. Pandas.
03_ROY,"Or making sure there's enough grizzly bears, that's fine."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"But... but, implicit is, that at any point in time, anytime in the future, that man the collective, you know, group."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"Or even, individual special interests decide, yeah, fuck the whales."
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,They're out of there. Bango.
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,"And, so anyway, interesting book. I read it because of this project. You know."
03_PETE,Which project.
03_ROY,The animal kingdom project.
03_PETE,Oh okay. I don't think I know about that project.
03_ROY,It's a thing I'm doing for Disney.
03_PETE,So is that why you went to Africa.
03_ROY,Yeah.
03_MARI,Such a scumbag.
03_PETE,So.
03_MARI,He's going back to um.
03_PETE,So he-.
03_MARI,"Nepal. And, India too, when. November. Make me <XX> <XX>."
03_ROY,Those are not all related languages.
03_PETE,No. They aren't.
03_MARI,What.
03_PETE,They... they just all happen to be in Southeast Asia.
03_ROY,Oh.
03_PETE,That's why.
03_ROY,Ilocano's in the Philippines. Right.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"I have a neat book, I don't know if you've seen."
03_MARI,What's Cebuano.
03_PETE,It's in the Philippines too.
03_ROY,It's on the island of Cebu.
03_MARI,Oh. Of course.
03_ROY,Figure that one out.
03_MARI,"No, I can't. It's a department store in Tokyo."
03_ROY,Um...
03_PETE,<XX>.
03_ROY,A book called...
03_MARI,<XX>.
03_ROY,Power and Gold.
03_PETE,Power and Gold.
03_ROY,Power and Gold. It's all about...
03_PETE,<XX>.
03_MARI,Moslems.
03_ROY,Jewelry traditions.
03_PETE,Hm... unhunh.
03_ROY,"Of the archipelago, of Indonesia and the Philippines."
03_PETE,Right. Oh that sounds great.
03_ROY,Do you wanna see it.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,It was at the LA County...
03_ROY,"<XX>, I'll be back."

03_MARI,No.
03_PETE,Okay. Cause there's. In the National.
03_MARI,Jakarta. No.
03_PETE,In the National Museum they have a Gold Room. That has all this gold stuff.
03_MARI,Oh God.
03_PETE,It's really neat.
03_MARI,"You mean, not made out of gold, just."
03_PETE,No.
03_MARI,Oh.
03_PETE,"I mean, it's this <XX>-... it's called the Gold Room."
03_MARI,"Well aren't you neat. Look at those little ends, all wrapped up in that plastic bag."
03_PETE,"Well, <XX>. Or do you like. Should they go somewhere, where they they recycle, or, turn into compost."
03_MARI,Um.
03_PETE,Or.
03_MARI,We don't have a compost pile yet.
03_PETE,So it just goes in the trash like this.
03_MARI,That's part of my.
03_PETE,Which is where.
03_MARI,"Landscape thing. Garbage is underneath. If you can save the bag, you can turn it inside out and save it."
03_PETE,"Oh, okay."
03_MARI,"It's okay, but, you don't have to."
03_PETE,"This is, this is. There's already plastic bags in there, so."
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_ROY,I'll put these on the dining room table.
03_MARI,"There's already a, <XX>."
03_PETE,Just. Oh.
03_ROY,Anyway.
03_MARI,Mm. Hey that carrot's good.
03_ROY,It's got... it's really pretty.
03_PETE,Well that's good.
03_ROY,It goes island to... island system by island system.
03_MARI,Are we ready to eat. Should I start food.
03_ROY,Oh yeah. Let's definitely um.
03_MARI,Make food...
03_PETE,<XX> of these.
03_MARI,"Um, they go in, how about that. That looks good."
03_PETE,Alright.
03_ROY,"I have that, and I have another one that's a museum catalog, called, Art of the Archipelago. I think that's what it's called. Which has Indonesian and Philippine architecture in it."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,I don't know if you've seen either of those.
03_PETE,No. No.
03_ROY,They're kind of neat.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_ROY,"These p-. He-... he, in here, has some theories drawing, at least art historical parallels."
03_MARI,What am I doing.
03_ROY,Between motifs of the.
03_MARI,Should steam these.
03_ROY,People of Asam...
03_PETE,<XX>. Unhunh.
03_ROY,"Uh, with, with, mostly Batak and Dayak and."
03_PETE,Oh really.
03_ROY,Stuff. Yeah.
03_PETE,Oh that's interesting.
03_ROY,And actually when you see it.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,When you see them.
03_PETE,Right.
03_ROY,"You can imagine, pretty clearly."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_ROY,"Some connection. Anyway, interesting. Hunh."
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_ROY,That looks like enough salad.
03_PETE,Oh I get it. Mar went out to put the. You put the water on the plants. Is that what was going on.
03_MARI,What.
03_PETE,You were watering with that. Is that what you were doing.
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_PETE,"Yeah, that's good."
03_MARI,Perfect water.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"Actually, you know, I'd love to do gray water."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_MARI,"Here, but."
03_ROY,It's illegal.
03_MARI,It's illegal.
03_PETE,Really. How rude.
03_MARI,Isn't that retarded.
03_ROY,Isn't that weird...
03_PETE,"It is. They just built a a great big gray water processing center, at the laundromat, in the complex where I live."
03_MARI,Oh.
03_PETE,It's like right outside our back door. There's all these huge machines and stuff.
03_ROY,Great m-.
03_PETE,"That like filter it and all, and then it. They're going to like, pump it into their watering system, for the apartment complex."
03_ROY,"Gray water systems are local to, I mean you get your own. You don-. It's not like a big system somewhere."
03_PETE,Right. Yeah.
03_ROY,You get your own gray water system.
03_PETE,Right. Yeah.
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_PETE,But this is like.
03_MARI,But it's a complex.
03_PETE,"Right. Cause, this is this apartment complex, and there's the laundromat, and they just dump the water, from that and everything."
03_MARI,"Well laundry's the best way, and showers. I guess."
03_ROY,The best way.
03_MARI,To get gray water.
03_PETE,"Right. Well I would think you wouldn't want to, think what might go down in the sink and stuff."
03_MARI,"You wouldn't want to what. Well, I guess, I guess it's more, that-. It's not that you don't want it on your lawn, it's that you don't want it sitting around. Before it goes on your lawn."
03_PETE,Right. Right.
03_MARI,Stuff from the sink.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,"Cause the stuff from the sink, would be great for your lawn, if it could get right out there."
03_PETE,"Right. Yeah, but then it would be sitting there, sort of decomposing, or doing its thing all over the lawn, instead of in a nice little compost pile."
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_PETE,So that's.
03_ROY,Well. Mm.
03_MARI,"Well not if you were careful. I mean, you know, if you... if you... if you didn't have, if you were really careful about your dishes."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,And scraped em off.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,And it was just <XX> runoff.
03_PETE,Mhm. Yeah. Well that would be good. Cause all of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with.
03_MARI,"But. Yeah. Actually, you know, Zeke the sheik is a local. You know, the guy whose compost pile blew up."
03_PETE,Oh no I don't know about this.
03_MARI,Didn't you hear about him.
03_PETE,No.
03_MARI,"It... it caught fi-. Here finish these up. It caught fire, and, um, he-... he used the compost from the, um, place next door, that was a big big big cemetery. And, here, you wanna butter these."
03_ROY,The grass clippings.
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_ROY,A huge cemetery.
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_ROY,They would mow their lawns.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_ROY,He would take the grass clippings.
03_MARI,"And he asked em, if he could have the grass clippings, for like fifteen years."
03_PETE,Mhm.
03_MARI,So he had this.
03_PETE,"How many, just make three of em."
03_MARI,Mhm.
03_PETE,Is that what's happening.
03_MARI,"Or however long the butter lasts, <XX> <XX>. Um."
03_ROY,So he had.
03_MARI,"And, and it blew up."
03_ROY,A forty foot tall compost pile.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"And it started to combust... you know, internally."
03_PETE,Right... just sort of naturally.
03_MARI,Just like Dickens. Mhm.
03_PETE,Spontaneously.
03_MARI,Yeah. Ah. Now what am I doing with this.
03_PETE,So just like this. Butter them. It's already open.
03_MARI,Yeah.
03_PETE,Okay.
03_MARI,Yeah and split em.
03_ROY,Okay.
03_MARI,You didn't even split em.
03_PETE,Pre-split.
03_MARI,"Yeah, those are left over. They're probably. Yeah, there might be mold. I think they're okay..."
03_PETE,"Oh, fine..."
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_PETE,Mm...
03_MARI,Mm. Delicious.
03_ROY,Mm.
03_PETE,Nutty sesame. Or. What is this.
03_MARI,Sourdough.
03_PETE,Poppy seed.
03_ROY,Are they.
03_PETE,No. Is the mold.
03_MARI,Oh yeah.
03_ROY,Oh.
03_MARI,Oh...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,No.
03_ROY,How are the beans.
03_MARI,Sourdough. How are the beans... <XX> Great. Yummy.
03_PETE,Is this like.
03_MARI,Delicious.
03_PETE,Uh.
03_ROY,Checking for an expiration date.
03_PETE,"No, I was just wondering what all the... what all the black things were in it."
03_ROY,Mold.
03_MARI,Oh.
03_PETE,Right...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,Shall I do something civilized...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,Like clear the table...
03_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
03_ROY,Or are we just gonna barbarian it out.
03_MARI,"No, why don't you clear the table. Unless we want to eat outside."
03_ROY,"It's dark, how will we see what we're eating."
03_MARI,Candles...
03_PETE,<XX>.
03_MARI,You wanna eat inside or outside Pete.
03_PETE,I don't care. Outside's fine.
03_MARI,"Let's eat outside. Ju-. But you still have to clean off that table, cause it's grody."
03_ROY,Which table. This table here.
03_MARI,"No, the table outside."
03_ROY,I have to clean-... the table outside.
03_MARI,Mhm. It's dirty.
03_ROY,A little outside cleaning.
03_MARI,"So, wash it with that cloth or something."
03_ROY,"Wash it, wipe it down."
03_MARI,"Oops, sorry. Did I get you."
03_PETE,Nope...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Thought I was gonna get you...
03_PETE,"<XX> this away... <XX>, <XX>."
03_MARI,"Shit. Beans, beans, beans..."
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Oops. Shit. Oh I love green beans. And they are so good leftover. With lemon and garlic.
03_PETE,So these are just the spices that are black and green and stuff.
03_MARI,I guess. Where's the black. I don't see any black.
03_PETE,"Well, I don't know. Well it's... maybe just the light."
03_MARI,"It's kinda, I think it's oregano."
03_PETE,"I guess it's just really dark, it's oregano and stuff yeah."
03_MARI,Dark oregano... <XX> That famous black oregano...
03_PETE,<XX> <XX> <XX>. Alright.
03_MARI,"It's like, purple basil. Purple basil..."
03_PETE,Right...
03_MARI,<XX> <XX>.
03_PETE,So should I just finish it all off. Make this really decadent and rich and.
03_MARI,"Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Get rid of it. Oh look, a little lemon from the tree. Ew, they're still kinda yucky. You know, we came back from a, we had to go to the Ritz Carlton, out in Laguna, for a event. And w- we were gone what. Four days. You know. S- really relaxing weekend, you know, it was really great. And I'd had this, I'd had a particularly stupendous time. Because I had to be a wife most of the time, but part of the time I got to be a worker, and do the really fun work, so it was really great."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"I had a great time. And uh, we're pulling up, and I see this girl. Who I'd never seen before, sort of dart out of our driveway..."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"And stand there, and watch us pull in, and she goes like this. Like, oh my God. I'm gonna getting caught. And I said, hi, can I help you..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"You know. And she goes, and I-. You know, of course it's this long drive, so I. I probably look like total hell."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,"And she goes, Oh, um, I was just getting some lemons..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"And I said, oh yeah. Who are you..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"And she goes, oh, I'm your next door neighbor..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"No she said. First she said, Kenneth said I could have some. Who's this guy, this old guy across the street."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"So Roy had said to him, if you ever want lemons, you know, go ahead and and have em."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,"Then he said, she said, oh Kenneth said I could have some lemons."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,"I said, he did..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,"She goes, Yeah. And I said, oh. And she goes, do y-... you don't mind, do you. And I said, well yeah, in fact I do mind. Cause I thought the lemon tree was dying. I didn't see any lemons on it."
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"Uh uh Cause she said, you wouldn't mind if I came back and got a whole bag full, would you."
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,I said yeah...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,There's like one lemon left on this tree that I can reach.
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,You know.
03_PETE,Unhunh.
03_MARI,"Roy's about to go to Africa, and so I'd never-... you know, I'd have to get a step ladder out, to pick my own lemons and stuff. Give me a break."
03_ROY,"I have to use a um, what, this abrasive sponge, to clean that table off."
03_MARI,"Okay. Why, is it grody."
03_ROY,Well it just doesn't come off very easily.
03_MARI,"Should I make like tartar sauce, or something really decadent."
03_ROY,What's this in this squirt bottle.
03_MARI,"Um, Windex."
03_ROY,I'm gonna use some of that.
03_PETE,Does tartar sauce go with with Cajun spices.
03_MARI,Well we could make.
03_PETE,"I mean, that doesn't matter, I suppose it just."
03_MARI,"Oh, you know what, we have this neat island mango sauce."
03_ROY,Fields.
03_PETE,Mm...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Chutney sauce.
03_ROY,Chutney.
03_MARI,That would be good.
03_PETE,Yeah.
03_MARI,I have tons of chutney.
03_PETE,Well that sounds good.
03_MARI,Chutney.
03_PETE,Do you save these things.
03_MARI,"Um, I think that one'll save. Yeah."
03_PETE,Oh okay. I'll just put it in the sink.
03_MARI,Sure. What are those little things called. Small plastic.
03_PETE,Containers.
03_MARI,Re-useable containers.
03_PETE,Right...
03_MARI,I guess. Mm.
03_PETE,"Oh, this looks yummy."
03_MARI,Oo. That's really good. A little salty. Mm.
03_PETE,Mm yeah.
03_MARI,"Oh, I guess we ought to put those in the oven, if we're gonna eat em. Hm."
03_PETE,It says chicken livers on it.
03_MARI,Yeah. It's amazing what happens if you keep it in the fridge long enough.
03_PETE,That's right...
03_MARI,"I figure, every. What goes around comes around. You know..."
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Everything'll mutate into something you can eat eventually...
03_PETE,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,But seriously folks.
03_PETE,That looks good.
03_MARI,"Oh, shit. Are we flaky yet. No, oo. Not even close."
03_PETE,Yum... <XX> do anything.
03_ROY,My but it's hot.
03_MARI,I know. In here you mean.
03_ROY,Yes.
03_MARI,Well we got everything on. The oven.
03_ROY,"You could say, my butt it's hot."
03_MARI,My butt...
03_ROY,<NONVERBAL>
03_MARI,Where did that come from. Why did we start saying that. My butt.
03_ROY,My but she's fat.
03_MARI,"My butt, she's fat. Yeah, where did we hear that. On TV."
03_ROY,It was a poster at a circus.
03_MARI,"Oh yeah. My butt, she's fat."
03_PETE,Fat...
03_MARI,Didn't we say... weren't we saying that when we <XX> to see you in Indonesia.
03_PETE,"No, I don't remember that."
03_MARI,My butt.
03_PETE,I think it's the first time I've heard that.
03_MARI,"That's one of the things, in my job I have to-. Ouch. Shit. Watch out for."
03_PETE,Saying things like that.
03_MARI,"Yeah. Like, um, you know, mo- mothers with... you know, children with no heart, or something, you know, can't ride the ride. Stuff like that. All the bad breaks."
03_PETE,Oh.
03_MARI,You have to watch for the bad breaks.
03_PETE,Right.
03_MARI,"It's pretty funny. Well let's just woop it up and put a little olive oil in here, so these don't burn to death."
03_PETE,"Oh the real thing, not the spray on stuff."
03_MARI,Really. NA
