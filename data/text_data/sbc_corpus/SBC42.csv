42_KEND,What'd you do Sabrina.
42_SABR,"Nothing. I left the phone in my bedroom last night, and so I'm grounded from the phone... It was an accident."
42_GEMI,You guys are always in trouble. What's up with that.
42_KEND,Mom's a bitch...
42_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
42_KITT,Get your feet off of there. Get your feet off of there...
42_ENV,<NONVERBAL>
42_KEND,You're so stupid thinking I spent the night. I came home last night and told you.
42_SABR,"Kendra, just let it go."
42_KITT,You.
42_KEND,"No, because she doesn't."
42_KITT,All you said last night was.
42_KEND,She thinks I spent the night in my jeans.
42_KITT,Kim wasn't staying the night.
42_KEND,"If I did spend the night, and I was trying to lie, I would give up. Cause then I wouldn't care. Cause I knew I deserved it. But I didn't spend the night, and I don't deserve this. Kim couldn't spend the night, I told you. She could, but then af-. I wanted to stay at the game longer. And her mom wanted to take her home early, and I'm like, no let's stay longer. But her mom wouldn't let her. And so she went home and, I was like, I'll call you when I get home, and then you come over. And she goes, no just spend the night. We'll do this some other weekend. Okay cool, cause she had to go bowling in the morning. Talk to Melanie's mom. Her mom would know. I'll have Melanie call you."
42_KITT,Oh.
42_KEND,Her mom call you.
42_KITT,"Right, right."
42_KEND,Her mom wouldn't lie.
42_KITT,"Right, Melanie will call me to confirm your lie."
42_KEND,Melanie lies but.
42_KITT,You'll get a hold of her first. I know how that works.
42_KEND,No Melanie's mom.
42_KITT,I thought Melanie didn't have a phone. But I'm supposed to call Melanie's mom...
42_KEND,I didn't want you to have her phone number.
42_KITT,"Yeah, another lie. Remember."
42_KEND,That was a long time ago.
42_KITT,Now I'm supposed to re- a-. And I'm supposed to trust you every time you tell the truth...
42_KEND,<NONVERBAL>
42_KITT,But how am I supposed to know when you're telling the truth.
42_KEND,That was a joke. That was a joke.
42_KITT,"Yeah, and I'm supposed to read your mind and know what you're joking about."
42_KEND,"No but, it was a joke."
42_KITT,"You know Kendra, y-. I don't know how many times I gotta tell you, once you lie, once you lie..."
42_KEND,"<XX>, Are they having a carwash."
42_KITT,You lose th- complete trust.
42_SABR,No.
42_KEND,Yeah they are.
42_KITT,Yeah that's what it is a.
42_KEND,We should have a carwash there.
42_KITT,Carwash and a bakesale. They're not getting any people though.
42_KEND,Mm. Hot out.
42_SABR,"What's that supposed to be, they're making it into something."
42_KITT,You're not going anywhere for a while.
42_KEND,It's a bookstore.
42_SABR,Really.
42_KEND,"God, I didn't spend the night, that's what makes me so mad, I'm grounded for nothing. I was home all night last night, I came home and told you. And even my cuffs and everything's on my bed. So stupid. Next time if I leave in the morning, I'll wake you up. Mom I'm awake now, I'm leaving."
42_KITT,"Well you woke me up last night, to tell me Kim wasn't spending the night, I don't know why you couldn't wake me up in the morning, to tell me that you were going. You guys wake me up every time I'm trying to take a little nap."
42_KEND,"What if we are awake. I was tired this morning. So much fun. My hair looks like a mess. I left it in a ponytail, I didn't even have time to take a shower. I think if I spent the night I would've took a shower. All I need is your signature so I can play the volleyball. On the volleyball team."
42_KITT,No. No.
42_KEND,Why. It's just volleyball. It's f- like on Saturdays and Wednesdays. It's for church. It's fun.
42_KITT,You have practice every Wednesday.
42_KEND,"Yeah but, not at- uh. This is at six thirty."
42_KITT,I don't care.
42_KEND,And Susan's going to it too.
42_SABR,Mm. Who cut the grass.

42_SABR,Gonna rip your purse.
42_GEMI,"I know, <XX>."
42_KEND,"See if I spent the night Mom, you'd think I'd still be in my uniform."
42_KITT,I know she's. J- she-. See now she's trying to think of ways to cover her tracks. I know what you're doing. Seen this before.

42_SABR,<XX>.
42_KITT,"Uh, just because it's white."
42_SABR,Off.
42_KITT,Doesn't mean it's clean.
42_SABR,"No. It it's white, means it s- shows dirt more. Stained."
42_KITT,I'm gonna get a pair of gloves on. I think Curt still has your keys.
42_SABR,It should be on the table. On the desk.
42_KITT,N- I don't know. I don't know where my other glove is either.
42_SABR,He. Cause he um.

42_SABR,"When he came to get my car, he was using the spare. And, yesterday, when I was looking at, the ke- on the desk, it was the spare-. My. My original key was still there. You know what. I think I'm gonna take, trade the spare key, for the original key, cause, everybody makes fun of my key."
42_KITT,What's wrong with that key. I like it.
42_SABR,Too big and bulky.
42_KITT,"You can find it though, can't you."

42_KITT,Well what did you guys do with that one I made. I'd like to have it back.
42_SABR,Okay. I'll try- see if I can find it. Wonder where I put it.
42_KITT,Hunh. I'd like to just keep that card.
42_SABR,Ooh. I left it at the carwash...
42_KITT,<NONVERBAL>
42_SABR,"So they c-. The girls could sign it. If the carwash was that little party we saw, I bet you they threw away."
42_KITT,"N- n-, It's probably outside and ended up getting trashed. I wanted to keep that. If you guys weren't gonna use it. I should've just done it myself."
42_SABR,"Hey you never know, it might have gotten <XX>..."
42_KITT,Ask Kendra. She might have done something with it.
42_SABR,I'll ask <XX>.
42_KITT,"Y- you know, I. I. You know, it took me a while to make that thing."
42_SABR,"Well, I know."
42_KITT,"You guys just. Yeah, I don't know why I bother sometimes... NA"
