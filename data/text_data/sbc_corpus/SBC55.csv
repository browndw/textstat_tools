55_PERR,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, It's uh, truly a historic occasion today, to have uh among us, a citizen who has contributed so much, not only to this entire area, but t- to the world of ceramics, and also to the world of literature, and been part uh..."
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,"Of one of the great artistic movements, which revolutionized, the way art was considered, and which today still has, extraordinary resonance, in the work of younger artists, who are rediscovering, something that was discovered, at the v-... almost at the beginning of this century, and with which Miss Wood, was so intimately involved..."
55_WOOD,<XX>.
55_PERR,To have the Mother of Dada with us...
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Let's keep <XX>, Is this it."
55_PERR,"Is in deed a pleasure. N- now, I would like to hold forth, but I don't think I'm going to be allowed to..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,So...
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,"Beatrice uh, it is yours..."
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,Is uh my voice alright...
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Like this alright. Now, referring to that period, just mentioned. It all touched me, by the name no. No is the most dangerous word in the English language. And, it has absolutely changed my life. For instance, I was brought up, very carefully, I was a good little girl. And I was in great revolt. My mother saw that I had a governess, that I went to private schools, and I was in. I didn't like this at all. Now, one day, I met Elisa. A journalist. She knew writers, she knew artists, she lived a bohemian life, and I was very attracted. And interested. So I invited her to home, for luncheon. After she left, my mother said to me, she's common..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"That hurt me. That was first no. Alright, So the next time, I went to see her, and, she had a little apartment in Greenwich Village, and she said, there's a young musician, of twenty-six. Who's broken his leg, he's French, he's very lonely, you speak French, so go see him. So uh, I went to see him in the hospital, and it was uh Varese, the musician of the avant-garde music, and, the second time I went to call on him, Marcel Duchamp was there. The great painter, of The Nude Descending the Staircase. Alright. Marcel Duchamp, introduced me, to, Henri-Pierre Roche. Roche was a collector of art, and a diplomat, uh sent by the French government, very correct, he called on my parents twice, and after he left, my mother said, you're in love with that man. You shouldn't see him again..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,I didn't know whether I was or not...
55_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,But I was attracted. Alright. That was her second no...
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"So, very politely, he called a third time, and I said, oh uh. I was at the phone, I'll come to see you. He said, oh no, I just have a little apartment in Greenwich Village, it's nothing at all, I said oh that's alright, I don't mind, he said, no no no, it's. It's not. It's not attractive. I said look. I'm shopping just around the corner..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,I see you get the point...
55_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"It was a lie, if I ever said one..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"So, I um, m- decided, and I went to see him. And I entered his very simple little room, I looked around it, and I remembered there were very coarse curtains, and the sun shone through them, made them like gold, and I stood in his room, and he was very nice gentlemanly man, he didn't quite know what to do, so he came, and he stood opposite me, and looked at me, And, I saw a painting on his wall, and I saw, a glass of water on the table, and, he wasn't saying anything. So, finally I looked at him, and I said, aren't you going to show me your etchings..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"From that time on, I was never a good little girl..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"That, it was the kind of life I wanted. He, uh, uhuh, he uh, and Duchamp, introduced me to the Arensbergs, and I met all the great artists of that day, and had a wonderful time. I was just I think twenty-two, going on twenty-three, so, I was of age. And my mother couldn't say anything..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Now, I'm very international, in feeling. I've traveled quite a good deal, and, to me as I travel, people are the same everywhere. And in spite of having this feeling for the whole world. I love that I'm a Californian, I..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"I was born in San Francisco, and one of the reasons I love California so much, is, that it's kinky. And..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"But this is very important. Because, new ideas, come up because it's kinky. And, it's just wonderful, the uh marvelous new ideas that come up. And of course, what I like about America, because, in spite of being very international in my feeling, I think ours, is a wonderful country. We're quick in friendship. We are open to new ideas. We made, we presented many new inventions. But, and this is very serious. Our, um, uh, athletes, our actors uh, are getting millions. And our teachers, are being cut down. And our libraries uh, are being closed. This is very very serious, it's putting a block on knowledge, China, and other Middle East country-. Not other Middle East but uh, Middle East countries and China, and other countries uh, are realizing the importance of education. And going after it. And we, are cutting down. In that direction. And it worries me a great deal. Now. One of the wonders of America, however, in spite of the bad things, several years ago, Tony Prieto, uh, who taught ceramics, I think at Mills College, he and his wife, uh went to Europe. To learn. And we he rela- turned, he said, Europe shares nothing. America shares. And because America shares uh, our craft movement. Has grown so wonderfully. We're doing wonderfully inventive things in craft. Uh, I have been very fortunate myself, I'm not naturally a craftsman, but, I've had uh four very wonderful craftsmen, to help me, uh Lukens at USC, the Natzlers, Otto and Gertrud Natzler, great potters, when they first came to America, Gertrud Natzler, would sit by me at the wheel, and help me try, to see what throwing was about, then, my colleagues in Ojai, Vivika and Otto Heino, they've been so generous, they're teachers, they pass down everything, they've helped me, and uh, I remember Toshiko Takaezu, her name's so hard for me to say, was visiting me, she spent a day and a half helping me, center on the wheel. All this sharing. In our schools. Amongst craftsman themselves. Is a wonderful thing. So the movements go on. And of course uh, our museums uh. Are so important. I don't know, if military minded people, hope nobody from the FBI is here..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"If our military people-, if uh, realize, the importance of museums, museums protect all the great art. The great invention. The creative efforts of man from the beginning of time. And, they're our inspiration, and I think our museums are doing wonderfully now, even though, we're beginning to cut down on education. I uh, I feel, about the importance, of craft. Of bringing beauty. Craft into life. One day I said to Vivika Heino. Because I'm a snob about art. Ever since a child, I've been dragged, through the museums of Europe, and America, and my eyes are exposed to great art. So I said, you know, it's a mistake, to teach, cr- uh pottery, in high school. The students haven't time to make anything beautiful and important. And Vivika Heino so wisely answered, that is not the purpose. It opens them. To aesthetics. And that's what right education does. Now, I wonder. We have a tremendous population in prison. And it's growing, we can hardly house them. Why. We put the cart before the horse. We put people in prison. Why. Because they have not had right education in the beginning. And right education, is the basis of everything. Now ha- I'll end with one other idea, and then you can ask me questions, and that is this. Since there is an Olympic of athletes. Why not have an Olympic, of ethnic and tribal dancers, from countries all over the world. Then people could come, and meet, they'd have beautiful costumes, friendships would be made, and, I don't think we can have peace, just with guns. Peace comes through friendship. And friendships would be made, with all these dancers intermingling. And even dancing with each other. Because, when you touch, you don't shoot..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"And uh, I base this uh, on a little experience of my own, when I was in, uh uh Ojai. As a sweet young thing. I would go dancing at the art center. I knew all kinds of square dancing, folk dancing, nobody cared, who we were dancing with, if it was the rich rancher, or, a man taking care of trash, nobody cared. As long as he was a good dancer. And after..."
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Every month, we had a party. And all of us, mixed together in friendship. That is wonderful. And, something like this could happen. If we had great dances. So, I come back, my last word is, violence, never ends, with violence. And right education, is the basis, of everything..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,"Well, I do hope that there is someone from the FBI here, to relay this message..."
55_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,To the State Department...
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,Because if the State Depart-.
55_WOOD,Okay.
55_PERR,"I hope that there is someone from the FBI here, so that they could tell it to the State Department..."
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,"Miss Wood asked me to inform everyone, that her hearing was rather difficult, at the moment, and so, uh, I will have to speak very loud, and clearly, so so- she can hear what I say."
55_WOOD,"Yes, I'm very hard of hearing. Age. There's no getting around it..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"So, Mister Perrot will take questions."
55_PERR,"So, if you will ask your questions clearly, and please don't make them too long, s-... because I might forget, the beginning, by the time I reach the end..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,"Uh, then, I will relay them to Miss Wood. And, uh, as far as I know, there are no restrictions, on any questions, that you could ask..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,Who would like. Yes.
55_AUD,"Beatrice... when did you first get, uh, into a living relationship in Paris. With all those wonderful artists. At what age."
55_PERR,"W- w- when did you get into a living relationship, with those p- artists in Paris, at what age."
55_WOOD,With artists in Paris.
55_PERR,Yes.
55_WOOD,"Um, I went to study art in Paris. A little bit... uh But I really didn't meet any answers, and to answer your question the way I think you would like it answered..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,I was twenty-three. In New York...
55_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,Mhm...
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"And, it was my mother's no..."
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"That, I was so, uh really, b- b- bothered. By her remarks. That I just broke loose. And went, in the direction I wanted. She wanted, a different direction. Social life. Have me married to a stock broker."
55_AUD,Oh...
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"I wouldn't be here, I would've murdered him..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"I say this, in spite of not believing in violence..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"My whole life changed. And I think I was very lucky. Because, uh uh three... uh uh oh four friends, did so much, to help my education. Marcel Duchamp, Roche, the collectors, the Walter Arensebergs, and then, my old schoolmate, Elizabeth Reynolds Hapgood. Hapgood was co-, was uh editor of Collier's, a close friend of President Wilson, and Elizabeth herself, spoke Russian. So she knew, this was years and years ago, before even any of your grandmothers were alive..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Uh Uh, uh uh, it was uh, uh uh, she knew all the Russian ambassadors, Pavlova, Nijinsky, uh, Isadora Duncan, uh all those people. I met through my own schoolmate, Elizabeth Hapgood. So I have been very lucky."
55_PERR,Another question.
55_WOOD,You fear I'll tell the truth...
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,Bravo...
55_WOOD,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,Nothing but.
55_AUD,"How was your relationship with your mother, after you broke away from her."
55_PERR,"How was your relationship with your mother, after you broke away from her."
55_WOOD,"Um, I broke away, I was acting then. In the French theatre... uh. I wasn't really, too interested, in the stage... uh But, in those early years, I thought it was the only way I could earn money. And I threatened my mother to run away, so she said, if you really mean that, I'll take you to Paris. And you can study under the Comedie-, Comedie Francaise. Because she thought, that if I acted in French, it was safer. Than if I acted..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"In America. So, I, uh uh, I was acting in the French theatre, then I. I was the ingenue, I spoke perfect French, had beautiful clothes, uh, for two years, I think I did over sixty parts. But I want to act in English. And my good friend, Elizabeth Hapgood. On account of Russian, and knowing, so many people in the theatre... uh I got many parts offered me, and my mother said, No. You get leading lady, or nothing..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Now, part of me was really, a good little girl. Part of me, so I was very subdued. And, my spirit was being broken. Because she'd say, no. No. You can't do that, you can't do that. And then, a woman came from Canada. And said, will you come up for three weeks. To Canada, and act in the theatre there. On salary. And I said yes... uh And that's, when I broke, with my home. And, my mother, had a nervous breakdown for two days, and my father said, you're killing your mother... and I said, she's killing me. And I'm the younger, and I have a right to live..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"And I'll always, And I'll always, let you know, where I am. Now, I should say something nice about my mother..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"She was beautiful, and very generous, but she was in a way of thinking, you know, we didn't have radio, we didn't have television, life wasn't as open as it is now. And, any mother, would want, a protected, social life for their daughter. Probably. Now..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"When she died, in thirty-six. I had left home then, oh, for quite a few years. The last three months of her life we became friends. And she let go. Of all that kind of thing. That didn't interest me, and she was very wonderful uh, and open, and the last day of her life, she was dying of cancer, she was, conscious, she knew she was going that night, we joked about it, and, she said, now. Tomorrow, I understand there's a wonderful exhibition, don't tell any of the others, but go see it. She knew she wouldn't be here then, she was just wonderful. So I'm very happy to be say. To s- be able to say, we became friends. At the end. Mhm..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_PERR,"Yes, in the back."
55_AUD,"Can you expand, uh, just a bit, about your thoughts on uh, bringing art to the prisons."
55_PERR,"Could you explain, a little bit, about bringing art to the prisons uh. Your thoughts, about bringing art, to the prisons."
55_WOOD,"I think it'd be wonderful. Uh, I've always been, concerned about people being in prison, but I really don't know, very much, I just think it's a terrible thing. That we have so many, in prison. And I'm sure, we could s-, what is called save the lives, of endless people, if they had a creative outlet. But what is a young person to do. Brought up, not knowing in any way right from wrong, no compassion, seeing bing bing bing, uh guns used all the time, no money, drugs, why should they not steal. Now, I don't know if this has any value, it's personal... uh When I left home, I made a very unhappy marriage, in name only. But the man, it was a disaster. And I was, for quite a few years, without any money. And I mean, I sold w- my own books, to get money to eat. I know what it is, to be, at zero. I was not trained for the world. I didn't know, how to relate to the world. But uh, once a week, I always went back to see my parents... and, they never said anything. They never blamed me. From that time on. My mother said, uh she always had a very good, uh, luncheon for me. Suspecting, that I was hungry. And I was. One day she said, go up to my room, and get some information out of my purse. I went there, I opened her purse, it was full of money..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"And, I had the impulse to take some. I knew she wouldn't care, uh she probably sent me up almost to take some. And I stood. And then something in me said, no. That is not the way to live. And I didn't take it. Now, this is just a very poor little example. But, when you have no education, when you haven't read, I'd read a great deal. Of very fine books, also a lot of trash. But I'd enjoyed readings..."
55_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
55_WOOD,"Now, you have no guide, when you're a young person. Why shouldn't you steal, why shouldn't you shoot. Why shouldn't you go to prison. But look what we're paying for people in prison, instead of putting this, into education. You see, I feel, our culture, misses the first sell. Which I come back I say, is right education. And of course, uh from what I know, I've never had children, so I say this with apology, but I understand, that it's vital. For women to love their infants. To cuddle their infants. And from what I've read, all criminals, all abnormal people, it's because they've never been loved as young-, uh youngsters."
55_PERR,Yes...
55_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
55_AUD2,"I would like to, hear something about, how she came to be called, the Mother of Dada."
55_PERR,How did you become the Mother of Dada... NA
