21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,You know I remember some things I was afraid of...
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"All of us have been afraid of something, haven't we..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Or somebody.
21_MANY,Yeah...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know I remember uh, when I was a kid. And uh, maybe Paul'll remember this. But, we uh, we had this one... we lived in a a small cottage, in back of a three-tenement house... on uh Prospect Street in Lynne... number twenty-eight. You remember that Paul... And uh..."
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,It was...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"It was kind of a small house upstairs... it had uh, one large bedroom, actually two large bedrooms, which my mom and dad slept in, and the other bedroom, uh, it was all us five boys, in that one bedroom..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,With two beds...
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,Whoa.
21_WALT,"You know, And my sister..."
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Had her own room, cause she's the only girl..."
21_AUD,<XX>.
21_WALT,But it was a little smaller...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"So we had, uh, we had this one big bedroom... and there was two beds in the room, so that meant, three of us slept in one bed, and two of us slept in the other bed. And uh, I remember those days, I remember those days, uh uh, being with those guys, trying to get the covers, and many days I woke up with no covers, you know what I mean..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And one of my brothers wet the bed, so, I mean, it was like..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,Ugh.
21_WALT,"Ugh. One of those days you woke up cold, and a little damp. You know..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,Oh...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"That's kind of gross, isn't it..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Well that's how I grew up. But in this bedroom...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Um, Maybe that's why I turned out this way, I don't know. Just kind of crazy..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know. From a young age, I guess..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"But in that, in that, uh, bedroom, was a closet."
21_AUD,Yep.
21_WALT,"Well, Paul's saying, oh yeah, I remember that closet. You know..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,And this closet was there. And it was this incredible closet. And uh...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Every night before I went to bed, I wanted to make sure, that closet door, was closed."
21_AUD,Oh yeah...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Cause I knew, if that closet door was open..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I wasn't gonna sleep...
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Cause inside that closet...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,There was a nasty old boogyman...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Right Paul...
21_AUD,<XX>.
21_WALT,And I was afraid of that boogyman...
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know, during the day, I'd go in there, and look around, and see if I could find him. And I'd be amidst the shoes, and all the junk and stuff in there, and he wasn't there, but at night, that's where his home was..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,And I was scared of that.
21_AUD1,Yeah...
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Were you afraid of him Paul, as well, I don't know..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Were you afraid of that closet...
21_AUD,<XX>.
21_WALT,Yeah he was too...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"So, I'd never asked him that before, so..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"I'll have to ask my other brothers as well. You know, I remember some other things I was afraid of, I remember, at times, uh, we grew up in a navyh- neighborhood that was multi-racial. And uh..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Some of us didn't get along. And it was always interesting, that when you, got into trouble, you ended up dealing with a number of kids, besides just one. So I know of several times, I had an, uh, a kid that was after me, and uh, he would bring all his friends, and there'd be about ten kids waiting for me. After school..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Cause I went to a different school than they went to, and they got out earlier than we did."
21_AUD1,Uh-oh...
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"So it's kinda like, uh-oh."
21_AUD,M.
21_WALT,"There they are... what am I gonna do. And they can't come in the schoolyard. You know. Cause the adults'll put em out. But they're out there waiting, saying we're gonna get you Walt... we're gonna get you..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know. We're after you, and, and uh, and what I would do is, go all the way around..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Jumping fences, going through yards, you know, ducking down behind cars..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"So those guys couldn't get me... cause I was afraid, I knew what was gonna happen. Those guys were gonna beat the tar out of me..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"It's a good reason to be afraid, Isn't it..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I think so.
21_AUD,Smart.
21_WALT,"Throwing rocks at you, and things like that. But anyway, there was a time that eventually, eventually, I couldn't run, eventually I had to deal with my fear, and confront."
21_AUD,Yep.
21_WALT,"Those people. I still did get the daylights beat out of me. And uh, But I confronted my fear. You know I wanna talk a little bit about fear today..."
21_AUD,<XX>.
21_WALT,"Uh, cause I believe it's something that keeps us, uh from doing everything we can do, as human beings, the potential that God has given us, and I believe it also, really keeps us from..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"A, strong spiritual walk with God..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Let's open to Mark chapter uh, five, verse thirty-five. That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, Let us go over to the other side. Leaving the crowds behind, they took him along, just as he was. In the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern. Sleeping on a cushion. Hey. Man. The disciples woke him and said to him, teacher. Don't you care if we drown. He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, Quiet. Be still. Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, Why are you so afraid. Do you still have no faith..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_READ,"They were terrified, and asked each other, Who is this. Even the wind and the waves, obey him. Let's go on. Well they went across the lake to the region of Geras-... uh Gerasenes, when Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit, came from the tombs to meet him. I don't think he walked up and shook his hand, we're gonna see that in a second."
21_WALT,"This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"For he had often been chained, hand and foot. But he tore the chains apart, and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and in the hills, he would cry out and cut himself, with stones. When he saw Jesus from a distance, He ran and fell on his knees in front of him. He shouted at the top of his voice. What do you want with me Jesus. Son of the Most High God. Swear to God that you won't torture me... for Jesus had said to him, Come out of this man, you evil spirit. Then Jesus asked him, What is your name. My name is legion, he replied, for we are many. And he begged Jesus again and again, not to send them out into the area. A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, send us among the pigs, allow us to go into them. He gave them permission, and the evil spirits, came out and went into the pigs... aa The herd about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned. Those tending the pigs ran off, and reported this in the town, and countryside. And the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, They saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. Sitting there, dressed in his right mind. And they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened, T- what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and he told about the pigs, as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus, to leave their region... and I'm gonna stop right there. You know, as we look at this we see that, the disciples were afraid. They were terrified. Of what had happened in the boat. You know what it's like to be terrified. Have you ever been terrified..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I mean that's a pretty scary thing. Isn't it...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Being terrified is a very very scary word... especially if you've experienced it. Maybe you were in a car wreck one time. I was in a car wreck coming back from Indianapolis one time, we were going sixty miles an hour, and we're going down the freeway, and all of a sudden this woman pulls out of the ramp, trailor truck hits his brakes, he s-... he's... he's behind us, I thought he's coming through us, another person smashes us, we're spinning around the highway, glass is flying everywhere, and I'm saying Lord take me quickly. I was scared to death-, I was terrified. We ended up in the middle of the median, uh-, and, I had to crawl out through a window, to get out of the car. I was terrified. I know that feeling. That's what the disciples were feeling at that time, they were terrified. They didn't understand. What was going on. And then we see the demon-possessed man. He was um, really, think about how possessed he really was. He was strong enough to break irons."
21_AUD,Yep.
21_WALT,"On his wrists, and to free himself from the shackles, that were on his feet. And he cried out in the evening, and cut himself with stones. I mean he was a pretty wild guy, wasn't he."
21_AUD,Yep...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,But Jesus took good care of him. He gave him back his sanity.
21_AUD,Amen.
21_WALT,He gave him back his mind.
21_AUD,Yep.
21_WALT,"And the people came out to see what had happened, cause they heard about the pigs. And they came out it says, they were afraid too. They were afraid. Just like the disciples were afraid. They were afraid, and they asked Jesus, to leave, the region. You know it's amazing but, that fear... because they didn't understand. And they wanted to control... the situation. You know fear is o crippling..."
21_AUD,<XX>.
21_WALT,"I mean it just knocks on our door, every single day. Every single day we get up, it knocks on our door."
21_AUD1,Amen.
21_WALT,"We all have different fears... it kind of pulls us in, it entraps us. It keeps us from moving. We become immobile. And that truly is, what was happening, to the people. Their response was, no thi-... this is incredible. This is the son of God. Look at the great miracle that he's performed. He's given this man peace. He's given this man sanity. He's given this man life again. And we're grateful to you Jesus. We're happy Jesus. We're excited about what you're doing here... please stay with us, forever... we'll feed you, we'll take care of you. We'll become your friends. We'll sit at your feet. We'll pray with you we'll learn from you... wrong. Jesus, you just need to leave our region. Cause they were afraid."
21_AUD1,Mhm.
21_WALT,"Because they didn't understand. And they were no longer in control. But Jesus, was in control. They realized, that what Jesus had done, no other man, could possibly do. That there was something different about Jesus."
21_AUD2,That's right.
21_WALT,But their fear kept them from finding out exactly who Jesus was. Does your fear keep you from knowing exactly who Jesus is. Does your fear keep you from a radical relationship with God. Does it keep you from a personal relationship with God...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"More than just going to church on Sunday, going to a mid-week service, or, even going to Bible talks. Or group discussions. Or one-on-one study. Does your fear keep you from that radical personal relationship with God..."
21_AUD,<XX>.
21_WALT,"Does your fear keep you from, deep personal relationships with one another..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know the world is an interesting place. We all crave that. Don't we... as human beings, a personal relationship, we're looking for personal relationships, we're looking for friendship. Aren't we..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know, C- uh, Craig was uh, uh Greg was. I always get those two mixed up. Greg and Craig. You look so much arike like yeah..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Greg was sharing something with me, that, last Sunday, when we were in the middle of the snow storm, he decided, and the g- and and the and the brothers in that apartment, they were gonna go out and knock on all the doors, in their apartment, invite people to come to the worship service, cause no one could get out... they were all snowed in. So he went around the building, knocking on doors, which f- in itself is crazy. Right..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Yeah, it is. It's crazy. I mean, you know. How many times have you done that in your life... m it's crazy. It's out of the... out of the ordinary. Maybe a little bit insane. But anyway, they went around, knocking on doors, inviting people to come down, he said it was amazing, I could hear people there, but they wouldn't come to the door..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And then there were others he knocked on, the people would come to the door, they would talk, but they wouldn't open the door. Then there were others, who opened the door just a little bit..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Just t-... to see who was there... you know...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Or you look out that peep hole... let me just see-, the hole's about this big..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And you stick your, you know, you're looking like this..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Right.
21_AUD,Oh Lord.
21_WALT,"And then there were others, who opened their door, and went to the service, and it changed their lives."
21_MANY,Amen.
21_WALT,"But fear, keeps us from those personal relationships, with one another. We're so concerned about, what everybody else thinks."
21_AUD,Yep.
21_WALT,About us.
21_AUD,That's right...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Doesn't that cripple you.
21_MANY,Yeah.
21_WALT,"What's someone gonna think, if they find out I'm a Christian. What is someone gonna think, when I tell em I'm a disciple. That I don't do these things anymore. Jeez, what are they gonna think, if I invite them, to learn about Jesus. And to study the Bible. See we're so concerned, we're afraid, we're fearful, and that fear robs us, of that deep personal relationship with God, and that deep personal relationship with one another..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"We all experience it. It keeps us, fear keeps us from changing our lives..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,Preach it Walter.
21_WALT,Fear keeps us from changing the world...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Needed to overcome their fears. In order that they might have that radical relationship with God. The disciples needed to overcome their fears, in order to have a deep personal relationship with one another. The disciples, needed to overcome, their fears, in order to, change their lives. The disciples, needed to overcome their fears, in order to change the world."
21_AUD,That's right.
21_WALT,And if we go back and we examine the Gospels.
21_AUD,Amen.
21_WALT,"We see, very clearly, that all the time that Jesus spent with them, they were afraid. Peter was afraid. Thomas was afraid. They were many many times afraid. But they uh... they understood, the only way they would overcome their fear, would be, through Jesus Christ..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And his example. Because the Lord had many challenging times, in his life. Where fair. Where fear, could be the dominant factor..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"That could take away, his relationship, with God."
21_AUD,Amen.
21_WALT,"I mean think about it. You know I was uh, thinking about fear. And I guess that-, what prompted me about this, is cause I'm fearful person..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You say oh, well you're getting up here and speak in front of, two or three hundred people, and you know, you've done this, and you've done that, and you've done this, and I'm like, Well, Yeah, amen. But I'm still a fearful person..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,But I really wanna overcome my fears...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I wanna get.
21_AUD,Amen.
21_WALT,"Deeper and deeper with the Lord, I wanna get deeper and deeper with you, I wanna get d-. I wanna be able to change my life, and I wanna be able to change the world..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know I've had the opportunity, to r- to- to- just really go back, and read some things, outside of the Bible, uh, on Martin Luther King Junior. Cause the guy blows my mind. He blows my... here's a man who died, for what he believed. He died to see justice... equality... peace. He died for that. And I'm thinking, He is willing to drink that cup. He was afraid many times, but he pushed through his fears. In order to succeed and have victory. For himself, and for the people, that were around him. The Black nation of America. You know we need to learn, number one, if we are gonna overcome our fears, The first point is to face our fears. In order to overcome our fears, we must face our fears."
21_AUD1,Amen.
21_AUD2,That's right.
21_WALT,I w-.
21_AUD,Amen.
21_WALT,"I had the opportunity, as you know, to spend a lot of time with my brother, he's moved in with us, and just to talk. And and as we were talking, what came out, is really, his fears. What he was afraid of. In becoming a disciple. In becoming a Christian. And it brought me back, to the time when I was studying the Bible. And I remember all of the fears that were in my life... in c- in in making a decision, to follow Christ. You know I can remember the fear of, they all wanna take my money..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"That was a fear for me. That was real. I worked hard for my money. I was concerned about this, cultic organization, trying to take my money. You know, I'd look at the checkbook. My wife would write a check for ten dollars, I'd go crazy..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Cause I was afraid. They would take my money. Right Paul. Yeah. Sure...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I was afraid I was gonna lose my personality... as you can see...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I've not lost it...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,Amen. Amen.
21_WALT,It's been matured...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,"Yeah... thats, yeah. Amen."
21_WALT,I was afraid I was gonna lose my identity. Well as you can see...
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<XX>.
21_WALT,Still got one.
21_AUD,Amen.
21_WALT,"Maybe it needs to change some, but I still have it. I was afraid that, I'd be robbed of my individuality. I'd be robbed of my independence and my free will. Well let me tell you, I'm plenty independent..."
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,Uh-oh.
21_WALT,"And I have f- a free will to choose and pick, what I want to do with my life..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"But what I've chose, is to overcome my fears, and give my life, to Jesus Christ."
21_MANY,Amen.
21_WALT,"But we must face our fears. Ask yourselves, why are you afraid. Think about your own fears. Think about your own personal fears, inside your life. The deep ones. Not the outside ones about money and stuff. But the deep deep truths in your heart. Cause each one of us, have some things in our life, that we're very fearful about. Ask yourself, Why am I afraid..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"See we need to ask ourselves that question, every single day. We need to ask ourselves that question, every single time, it comes up. Because in that way, confronting our fears, It will give us, a measure of success. It will give us a measure of power. It doesn't mean we've done it yet, but when we bring it up, it will give us a measure of that power. It will give us a measure of success..."
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Not the total victory, but a small measure to understand, where we're really at."
21_AUD1,Yeah.
21_AUD2,Amen.
21_WALT,"You know, the thing about fears. The more we attempt to ignore or repress them, the more we multiply the conflict inside."
21_AUD1,Wow...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,That's right.
21_WALT,Isn't that true...
21_CONG,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know when you're afraid to deal with something, and you're afraid... and then all of a sudden, it starts multiplying..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,And now you're really afraid. Right...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,And now you don't want to say anything to any about anything. Right...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"Cause it's started to multiply. And the longer that fear goes, the more it multiplies... till it gets to the point where it totally immobilizes you."
21_AUD,Right.
21_WALT,"Till you become, totally, unable to move..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,You become stymied.
21_AUD,Mm.
21_WALT,Still...
21_AUD,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And we know as human beings, just like nature, if we're not growing, we're dying..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And that fear, starts to eat away, at you. You know the great thing about bringing your fears up too. Is that when you bring your fears up, what we find out many times, is that they're more imaginary, than they are real."
21_AUD,Yes...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Isn't that true...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"It's like, I need to talk to Windham, about this. It's like, oh, I don't know if I wanna talk to Windham about this. And then I start, Then this fear start to multiply..."
21_AUD1,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD2,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,You know what I mean.
21_AUD1,Yeah.
21_WALT,"Then I don't wanna talk. Right. Then u-... then I go and talk, oh he's gonna say this and, he's gonna say that and, he's gonna be in my face and, da-na-da-na-da-na-da-na. And I'm like, and then I go and I talk to him. I muster up... which is m- our second point, which is courage."
21_AUD,Amen...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"I muster up the courage, and I talk to Windham. And you know what, I'm like, wow. That isn't anything like I thought..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,Isn't that true...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And I feel so much better, I'm like, I can't believe I did that. What a dummy. What a fool..."
21_X,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"That I would think those things. See because a lot of times our fears, really are, imaginary. See, fear, really involves the misuse of our imagination."
21_AUD1,Yeah that's right.
21_AUD2,Mm.
21_WALT,"You know when you're talking about being a disciple, and you hear these incredibly hard sermons. And I do preach a few hard sermons."
21_MANY,Amen.
21_WALT,Today's not one of those real hard ones.
21_AUD,No.
21_WALT,I thought I'd give you a break...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_AUD,Thanks bro.
21_WALT,Maybe I needed a break...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"I've had a few this week. But really, it's true, I mean, we- we- and you hear these incredibly hard sermons, well what do they mean about this... and what do they mean about that. Oh ho ha oh ha..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,I mean I do that. I used to hear Kip preach in the opera house.
21_AUD,Woohoo.
21_WALT,"And I'd be like, Oh. Who is this man. Oh I can't believe he said that..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"And I'd go there, even before we even got there, I'd be sharing... we'd go, we'd be with Laurie, and I'd invite someone to come to church with me, and they would come, and I'd say, Boy, I hope he doesn't preach this and, I hope he doesn't preach that and..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"I hope he doesn't say this and, I hope he doesn't say that..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,You ever felt that way...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,See and we-... all of a sudden the fear starts...
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"You know what I mean... and it totally, our imagination runs wild..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,"See um, fear, is really, the misuse of our imagination..."
21_MANY,<NONVERBAL>
21_WALT,To focus on the negative.
21_AUD,Wow.
21_WALT,"As opposed to the positive. You could use that imagination, in a great positive way, to give you courage. And that's really my second point, to overcome fears, we really need to, be able to, have courage. Look it at first John chapter four. Actually, I do- I don't wanna leave this first point, till I make this, this point within the point... NA"
