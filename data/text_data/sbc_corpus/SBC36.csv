36_MARI,"He said actually fevers uhare. How did he explain it, he said something like, fethers. Fevers are like, um, good for babies like, when they're i- b- getting sick, because they help the immune system fight harder. Somehow."
36_LISA,Well that's what the.
36_MARI,I don't know.

36_MARI,"Yes doctor Kevin, tell us..."
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,"No I'm pretty. I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure that's part of it, but uhuh it's just that you have to watch out, cause then, if it gets too hot it's bad for the brain."

They'll have like twenty words or whatever, and they'll just ask for one thing. And then there's other kids who go, na-na-na-na-za-ba-da. And there'll be a word in there somewhere..."

36_KEVI,<XX>.
36_MARI,"Michael, Michael's shirt was all wet, from right here..."
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,From him just drooling...
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,It was gross...
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,Probably he was uh opening-.
36_MARI,And we took him to the <XX>.
36_LISA,"Breathing through his mouth more, cause he couldn't breathe through his nose at."
36_MARI,"Mm. And then he couldn't even breathe, he had, um, they had this thing, it was this big old long old tube."
36_LISA,Here.
36_MARI,"And it was funny cause, like, we could..."
36_BABY,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,They put a mist.
36_LISA,"Child, you're having problems."
36_MARI,"And you could just see like smoke, you know, like a mist, like a humidifier, coming out and I was like."
36_KEVI,Mhm.
36_LISA,Mhm...
36_MARI,and I was all.
36_KEVI,"Out of his throat, I mean then where'd they put this on, in where did it."
36_MARI,"No, they stuck it in a tu-. It came out of a tube, and I just had to hold it like, around his face."
36_KEVI,"Oh, oh okay okay."
36_MARI,So that he could.
36_LISA,Come here.
36_MARI,"It was oxygen, but they put a mist in it, so that he could. They didn't want to stick uh oxygen tube up his nose, or put a mask on him, cause he'd take it off."
36_LISA,Mhm...
36_MARI,"And it was funny, because every time like he'd see a person wearing blue, he'd be all, and he'd start like, not breathing..."
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,Oh.
36_MARI,"And then he'd like, poor. And then it would sto-. And they'd be all okay okay, and they'd walk out of the room, cause they didn't want to excite him, cause they didn't want him to hyperventilate."
36_LISA,Poor thing... <XX>.
36_KEVI,Yeah he's doing better.
36_MARI,"And then the doctor comes in, and he just looks at him, and then they stick this fing-... thing on his finger. It's like light sensored. And they have to guard it from the light, and that's what measures his heart rate. And it measures his oxygen percent, how much oxygen he's getting."
36_KEVI,Wild.
36_LISA,Cool.
36_MARI,It was weird. And he was all in.
36_KEVI,Did his oxygen get low. Or.
36_MARI,"Yeah, it was like eighty-six percent."
36_LISA,Yeah.
36_KEVI,Which. Of what's.
36_LISA,Supposed to be like ninety what.
36_MARI,"A hundred. Um, adults are probably."
36_LISA,Like ninety-seven's okay I think.
36_MARI,Adults are supposed to be anywhere from like ninety-three to on up...
36_LISA,"<XX>, You gonna go down."
36_MARI,But anything.
36_KEVI,And you ha-. Babies higher or lower.
36_MARI,Yeah.
36_LISA,Gonna go on the floor.
36_MARI,"Babies are usually higher, because you know they uh."
36_LISA,Are you mad at Nina.
36_MARI,They haven't been around as long...
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,<NONVERBAL>
36_KEVI,"So she. Yeah, so, he was really not doing well."
36_MARI,"No. Nobody should really be that low. I mean, people that are that low there's, they have asthma and stuff like that."
36_KEVI,Hee hee h- hee hee.
36_LISA,They like. Yeah. Or emphysema.
36_KEVI,Uh Ha ha ha ha.
36_MARI,But he was. And his heart.
36_LISA,What was his heart rate.
36_MARI,Two o four.
36_LISA,And it's supposed to be.
36_MARI,I think he said like one sixty-eight or something.
36_KEVI,"Well, babies are supposed to have really high heart rates."
36_LISA,But one sixty-eight versus two o four.
36_KEVI,That's still scary.
36_MARI,"And he'd just do, uh he was doing it, when he'd get really excited, so that's why they were staying away from him. And uh, we had to hold him down for them to give him a shot in his thigh."
36_LISA,"A shot, why'd they give him a shot."
36_MARI,To make the swelling go down in his throat.
36_KEVI,"Oh, did he get it in his bottom."
36_MARI,"No, right here in his thigh."
36_KEVI,How is he about shots.
36_MARI,He cries.
36_LISA,Probably not good anymore...
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,I remember the first time I took him for a shot... uh You know he was just little.
36_LISA,He did not care at all. He's all...
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,Happy-go-lucky.
36_KEVI,Dee dee d-dee.
36_MARI,"He was all, aah, aah, like that. And then after that it was okay. And then like..."
36_KEVI,That's good.
36_MARI,"The next time I took him he's all, I was all oh my God..."
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,And then I picked him up...
36_LISA,<XX>.
36_MARI,"And his legs were bleeding and stuff, and I had blood all on my shirt, and I was all oh my God."
36_LISA,Blood- uh.
36_MARI,"Blood, cause he bleeds. After they give him a shot."
36_KEVI,"But don't they, like put a thing on it right after."
36_LISA,But that much.
36_MARI,"No, but it was just coming out. Do you know what I mean, it was like, mm."
36_KEVI,"Well they should've have put, I mean usually you know like when you like give blood."
36_MARI,A bandaid.
36_LISA,But it wasn't all over.
36_KEVI,They use.
36_LISA,"It was just like, a little dribble."
36_MARI,"It had. N yeah no, it had gotten on my shirt, and I was just all oh my God."
36_LISA,"Oh, my child's bleeding."
36_KEVI,Baby blood.
36_LISA,Baby blood. Watch out for that glass. He's looking at it...
36_MARI,I'll trade you.
36_KEVI,Is it mine.
36_MARI,See I'm not supposed to give him juice in a bottle. He's supposed to drink it out of a cup.
36_LISA,Why not.
36_KEVI,Oh cause all the air.
36_MARI,He. No.
36_LISA,No cause.
36_MARI,They're get baby bottle tooth decay...
36_LISA,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,"From drinking, um, juice and stuff out of bottles, because the um."
36_KEVI,The sugar just stays right there.
36_MARI,Mhm.
36_LISA,Explain it Marie.
36_MARI,"Your brother did, so there you go..."
36_KEVI,<NONVERBAL>
36_MARI,<NONVERBAL>
36_LISA,That doesn't make sense to me. Why sh.
36_MARI,"Because when they just leave it in their mouth, the juice just."
36_LISA,Oh cause they don't swallow it right away you mean. They just gur-.
36_MARI,"Yeah, and in a cup they, you know they."
