10_PHIL,"But, But anyways, back to the the first thing."
10_BRAD,Okay.
10_PHIL,What we were talking about was.
10_BRAD,Yeah...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,I've gotta pick up Pat...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,I l-. I dropped her off at the bookkeeper...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,Uh.
10_PHIL,"Uh I would prefer that, that you were there uh on one hand, because I think that it would be most expedient. But I think, what was felt, was that at this point, rather than ha-... than create. I don't really f- find it to be, you know, a confrontation, by any means, but."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"I just think, they wanna be able to just kind of uh figure out, I think our board eh, quite frankly we have more problems to resolve interior, than we do outside of it."
10_BRAD,Hm.
10_PHIL,I think most of it is just attitudes.
10_BRAD,Hm.
10_PHIL,"I think, uh you know, like I said, what we need to do, is this board has to realize, in my opinion that, that they have to come to grips with, the fact that they are responsible, for basically what they've created."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"Okay, You know."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,You can't th- penalize somebody for m-.
10_BRAD,And the Vetters are somewhat responsible.
10_PHIL,That's right.
10_BRAD,And that's uh.
10_PHIL,Mhm.
10_BRAD,Well it was far beyond our control.
10_PHIL,"Well, and the thing is I mean."
10_BRAD,That uh.
10_PHIL,We're we're a different board. We are not the same.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,And we have to do that.
10_BRAD,That's right.
10_PHIL,"But we have to realize that there's, the faults here, we have to claim responsibilities. I mean."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"I think there was, there's manners of- of speaking that I was very outspoken about, at this meeting, you know, w- that I talked to uh Bill and Carmela and Nancy about, you know, and they... <XX>... we did... they asked me to meet with them about Teresa's thing."
10_BRAD,Mhm...
10_PHIL,"that I find v- really, nothing, to be honest, nothing of any validity."
10_BRAD,Well I... you know.
10_PHIL,Okay.
10_BRAD,I have spoken twice with Teresa.
10_PHIL,"Did you, Unhunh."
10_BRAD,Yeah...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,"And I told her exactly... well, i t- I simply told her what, what I know to have happ-... and I... it's... to me it's n- just ludicrous... and I... anyway, we... w- we went through the whole thing, and, uh, and and I also said, that it would probably, be brought up, at board retreat, or, D I don't know. Uh."
10_PHIL,Well I. I'm gonna write a letter to Teresa.
10_BRAD,"Uh, um."
10_PHIL,"Just to tell her that l-, you know... d- Thank you for your l-... you know, y what you've done for the board and so forth."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"And just say, you know, I'm hoping, we are gonna address this letter of concerns that you've given us..."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"Um, she's asked that, you know, she want-... she didn't really want her things to be kind of everywhere. You know those th-."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,What her comments. She really wanted em to be within this p- committee...
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,Uh my f-.
10_BRAD,Summarized... or something like that I guess.
10_PHIL,"S- they were her summar-... her summary, th- you know. She, kyu- very- m- very concisely."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"I don't know if she put it together, or if Nancy put it together. But."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"You know, that just says, uh they. I d-. I really had a ho-... everybody there, including Nancy..."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"You know. Uh had very little to- to... uh you know, to agree with the validity. Okay."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"It was a matter of. I just don't, uh you know, see where this is coming from."
10_BRAD,Yeah. It's...
10_PHIL,"Okay, you know, these are-... these are rooted."
10_BRAD,I know. Jeez.
10_PHIL,Obviously in a personal issue.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"Um, Teresa is a very sensitive person, she f-... you know, uh I don't. I have no doubt that she believes, what happened happened. But."
10_BRAD,Well but.
10_PHIL,"My- my feeling is, as I told them, I said, if it's that issue, I says, you know, I said let's just get real here. I said."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"We all know Brad, I said, we all know Teresa, I said, and I don't know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around Teresa. Period."
10_BRAD,Yeah. Unhunh...
10_PHIL,"I says, I don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say anything of that nature, I said, and, there-... it was very clear. You know. She kept saying, prefacing everything with, you know, this is not a personal attack. This is not a personal vendetta."
10_BRAD,"Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Right. Right."
10_PHIL,"Which tells you, that it is."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,That's immediately what it said. And that's what everybody perceived it.
10_BRAD,Yeah. There...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,"Yeah, there have been some uh, I'll te-... well it goes back to, if you can believe it I ha-. I know she... there was a a. We had a number of people once, at a party, uh, like half of the board-... it was a big mistake of mine."
10_PHIL,Yeah.
10_BRAD,"And I know, she felt really snubbed, and uh."
10_PHIL,Mhm.
10_BRAD,"And it was... and I- I called her in fact, later. And I said Teresa. Thi- this was not a w-. I invited people that helped with the market that year."
10_PHIL,Mhm.
10_BRAD,"I think it was two years ago, And I know, I mean that wa- really upset her. And jeez. If that's gonna upset her, Uh."
10_PHIL,Well that's that's the thing that.
10_BRAD,But anyway.
10_PHIL,"That see and the other thing that I've gotta do, too, is I wanna make sure, like, for example, Donna's aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"See I have not called her, but I'm gonna call her to tell her that."
10_BRAD,Mhm. Yeah.
10_PHIL,"You know, we're having a board retreat... you know."
10_BRAD,"Right... that it's not gonna include staff, if that's what we decide. Right. Unhunh."
10_PHIL,"And what we will do, is I think, what we're gonna probably wanna do, or what I would like to do, is I would like to take a day."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"D- during the week, and we'll just take a whole day. That day. And myself, uh, if we have a uh facilitator."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"Um, that that person, you and Patricia and uh D Donna."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"And maybe one other, or two other board members would, actually spend that day and just say okay, this is what went on at that retreat."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,These are the concerns.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"These were comments, uh these are the ones that we feel we can address. These are the ones that pertain to you."
10_BRAD,"Unhunh, Yeah."
10_PHIL,Uh.
10_BRAD,"I- I am concerned Phil that, you mentioned it yesterday. That that there may be a number of questions, that just cannot be answered. Without me being there."
10_PHIL,Yeah.
10_BRAD,I I- I think it's.
10_PHIL,Hi gato.
10_BRAD,You know I'm gonna have.
10_PHIL,Okay.
10_BRAD,"Can we talk l-... uh, I bet Pat's gonna... she's gonna start walking back to the office."
10_PHIL,Yeah.
10_BRAD,I dropped her at the bookkeeper.
10_PHIL,"W- w- why don't you call me, at least a little bit later maybe."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,And we can go do that.
10_BRAD,"Can I do that, Cause I... she'll be."
10_PHIL,Ji- Jim and I are gonna have lunch.
10_BRAD,Uh. I don't want to get her uh.
10_PHIL,"I don't know if you have plans or not. But, we're gonna have lunch later..."
10_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
10_PHIL,At noon.
10_BRAD,Sure.
10_PHIL,"If you wanna join us, it'd be great."
10_BRAD,Sure. Yeah.
10_PHIL,Um.
10_BRAD,"You wanna do it, where... what's the."
10_PHIL,"I uh... you know, I don't... my- my feeling is, I'm trying to, I think, what I wanna do, is... my- my point of wanting to push this retreat, I think it was really important was."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,To do it to e-... to make it sound like we're taking it seriously.
10_BRAD,Oh yeah.
10_PHIL,"But to also put into perspective, and see, w- that was one point of view why."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"You know, Like I said d- d- the facilitator, in in the beginning, I did not... wasn't really in support of one. And only because I felt."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,I wanna make it sound important.
10_BRAD,It would formalize it too much. Or.
10_PHIL,"I want-... it formalizing it, but it's also say-. I want it to come to the resolution that, things aren't that bad."
10_BRAD,Mhm. No.
10_PHIL,And that what.
10_BRAD,I.
10_PHIL,What we... and things aren't that bad. The thing is that we h- do have our attitudes.
10_BRAD,Mhm. Mhm.
10_PHIL,Okay.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"We have an attitude, you know, even what Ray's attitude with with Barbara."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"Is completely unheard of, you know and I'm... that bothers me a great deal."
10_BRAD,Jeez. I just couldn't believe that...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,When I heard it.
10_PHIL,"I-. I had, you know, I came real close to calling Ray, and just sitting and talking with him about it."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,But I figured no.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,I'm just gonna blow it off.
10_BRAD,"I think, he's off the board."
10_PHIL,I'm gonna blow it off.
10_BRAD,He's.
10_PHIL,I'm not gonna give m-.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"You know, we've done everything we needed to do."
10_BRAD,Right...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,Right.
10_PHIL,"I think, you know, what Barbara told me was that, Dolores was incredibly embarrassed, by his display, at this time in front of her. Dolores apologized for Ray to him."
10_BRAD,Really. Oh gee.
10_PHIL,So Dolores is obviously aware that.
10_BRAD,Oh gosh.
10_PHIL,"You know, and."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"She says, I don't know why he resigned."
10_BRAD,I don't know what's got in.
10_PHIL,Because he's been miserable...
10_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
10_PHIL,Because... w- which we know.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"That's why he was- kept trying to get involved and make it sound, you know, like he... and n you know, he was trying to make it sound like, same old complaint, same old everything, well, we didn't have any complaints..."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,I think this is one of the first years.
10_BRAD,I know.
10_PHIL,"That this has been so smooth. And I think, had we realized it."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,We would have allowed him to take a break four years ago.
10_BRAD,Yeah. Yeah...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"Because, and it wasn't so much-... it wasn't, you know like I told Jim, I said it wasn't anything that you did, wasn't anything else."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"I said, it was a matter of, you know, Brad did, uh and Pat did, the organization, I said, which was the best thing. I th- I agree with that."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,I think that was the best thing to do.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,It was a lot of time.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"But I think, we need to... we need to d- establish duties."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"You know. Which we decided. And see part of what we decided with these duties is, just deciding, what we need to do what. You know. There's gonna be tasks."
10_BRAD,Mhm...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,As specifically as we ca-.
10_PHIL,Uh.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,See and I'm I'm... on one hand I'd like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes...
10_BRAD,Unhunh.
10_PHIL,You know. Pat does that.
10_BRAD,"Yeah, I know. There's... really the secretary serves almost no function."
10_PHIL,Just i- th- not.
10_BRAD,"You know I, it's just uh."
10_PHIL,There signs... she signs her name thirty times.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"You know, in the last f- y-."
10_BRAD,Right. Right Phil.
10_PHIL,Two days ago. Well.
10_BRAD,That was it. That was it.
10_PHIL,That's a problem.
10_BRAD,That um.
10_PHIL,"I... you know, and I think we wanna do that. We need to say. You know, Pat's been great enough to do this, uh and if she really wants to do it. I'm not gonna uh dissuade her from doing it."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,But one thing we have to be careful of.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"That I mentioned to Jim, and I've mentioned it to Pat lightly."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"Which is to be careful about saying things. You know, like in board meetings. In- interjecting too much."
10_BRAD,Yes.
10_PHIL,Okay...
10_BRAD,I know.
10_PHIL,"Because in board discussion, I mean."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"O- on one hand, as a member she has every right. To- to speak what she wants. But."
10_BRAD,Mhm...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,No. But that's.
10_PHIL,"The thing is, you know. I've just seen some of the looks, from some of the people, you know, who feel, I'm a board member."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"And whether... the board you know, if they don't interject anything, but whether they do or not. I think we have to be careful."
10_BRAD,"Mhm. Well Phil, that, I mean that goes."
10_PHIL,"Be- because, where that came in."
10_BRAD,That goes for me as well then. It.
10_PHIL,"Yeah, it does. But."
10_BRAD,It um.
10_PHIL,"I think what's different is, You."
10_BRAD,Um.
10_PHIL,You've been much more responsive in this sense.
10_BRAD,I mean.
10_PHIL,Okay. Pat's more opinionated in that sense.
10_BRAD,You know I. Unhunh.
10_PHIL,Okay.
10_BRAD,"I... what I try to do, is is is just respond to question-..."
10_PHIL,<XX>.
10_BRAD,"And if I need to fill in blanks, which."
10_PHIL,Oh yeah. That's fine.
10_BRAD,You know.
10_PHIL,That.
10_BRAD,But.
10_PHIL,See but that... your... your position is different.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,Okay.
10_BRAD,That's. Yeah that's true.
10_PHIL,"Yours is in a... is a much more official capacity, because you are the one who answers to the board."
10_BRAD,Yeah...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,Right.
10_PHIL,You have to do that. And you are- th- can voice an opinion about things...
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"But the biggest deal, where I thought it uh was an issue, th- where I heard things about it was, during the annual meeting, right after, when we had the discussion about the poster."
10_BRAD,Oh.
10_PHIL,When we brought up the thing.
10_BRAD,Was Pat uh.
10_PHIL,Pat was right in the middle of it.
10_BRAD,"See, I. I wasn't there."
10_PHIL,"And she was saying, well this is a great piece, and this is this. Well."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"You know, I didn't wanna embarrass her."
10_BRAD,She shouldn't have done that.
10_PHIL,And I didn't wanna do anything.
10_BRAD,I know.
10_PHIL,"But I just saw, people kinda going."
10_BRAD,That was out. Yeah.
10_PHIL,You know.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,And.
10_BRAD,That's true. She shouldn't've been in on that at all.
10_PHIL,"She shouldn't've been, uh you know, cause that's not part of her capacity, she's not on that committee."
10_BRAD,Mhm. Mhm.
10_PHIL,"You know, and if she wants... you know, uh basically the thing is, you know, if she wanted to be a board person."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,That's fine. I mean let's look into b- pursuing that.
10_BRAD,Right. Right.
10_PHIL,"But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose Jim because of that... he feels there's a conflict. And uh, it's definitely gonna happen."
10_BRAD,"I mean he says. There's no question about it, we've talked."
10_PHIL,"Yeah, and maybe it's right. Maybe it s- it is gonna be right."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,You know.
10_BRAD,Well he... d. I mean he doesn't seem to... uh uh you've talked to him and I've talked to him and.
10_PHIL,"Well, he seems to be."
10_BRAD,"I mean he says mayb-... you know, after the board retreat... now."
10_PHIL,Yeah.
10_BRAD,But not.
10_PHIL,Well I a-.
10_BRAD,You know.
10_PHIL,"I wanted him, I said I want you to stay through the board retreat."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"I says, and the reason is, because I said we need people who know, I said right now we have, You know, four new board members. Or five."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,You know.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"Four, whatever."
10_BRAD,Four new board... yeah.
10_PHIL,"And, we're at this point of saying okay. Uh, All of a sudden, we have t- all these, you know, questions to answer."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,You know... we have all these things that we have to do.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"And we have this commitment of time. Uh, and but they don't know, everything that's gone on, in the last years."
10_BRAD,They need to be educated as to.
10_PHIL,See this.
10_BRAD,No... no.
10_PHIL,"This retreat, that's why you see, I think it's important. Because, I mean I realized, that I'd never seen the bylaws, since I was on the board until I asked for a copy."
10_BRAD,"Mhm. Mhm. Right. Yeah. Now what I... what I have done though, is to, you know, any new board member that jumps on, I send them."
10_PHIL,Good.
10_BRAD,Copies of the.
10_PHIL,"Because, I wanna."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,I wanna get these books.
10_BRAD,But ty-... typically they no one reads em.
10_PHIL,Well that's fine.
10_BRAD,You know. But it's. At least they've got.
10_PHIL,"But I think, what I wanna do is, I'm gonna. I wanna draft a letter."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,Like I said which.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"Uh says to them you know, this is what we're doing, this is the purpose of this retreat."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"To new board members, and, you know, board members, for a while it was, we need to find out what it is we're doing."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,Whether we're doing something right or not. You know.
10_BRAD,Right...
10_PHIL,<NONVERBAL>
10_BRAD,Right.
10_PHIL,I think we are. B- but.
10_BRAD,Oh yeah. Sure we are.
10_PHIL,I think.
10_BRAD,Sure we are.
10_PHIL,"The thing is, uh I don't. I need to b-... them to kind of commit. To to being responsible."
10_BRAD,Mhm. Yeah.
10_PHIL,"And uh, I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking charge, but th- I guess that's what I'm I'm needing to do."
10_BRAD,Well yeah for.
10_PHIL,You know but.
10_BRAD,"Y- y- you do, and you're."
10_PHIL,And that's kind of why I'm.
10_BRAD,And you're present.
10_PHIL,I'm going to assign things.
10_BRAD,Unhunh.
10_PHIL,"You know, at some point we're gonna have committees, and we're gonna have, you know."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"B- people, that'll be given tasks."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"You know, Specifically."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"Like, you know, I didn't need to do all this calling aro- to find a r- a r- retreat space, but I figured, if I don't do it."
10_BRAD,That's right.
10_PHIL,It's gonna fall on you or Pat.
10_BRAD,Yeah. Of course. Yeah.
10_PHIL,You know...
10_BRAD,And normally that's that's what happens.
10_PHIL,"Uh That's okay, but."
10_BRAD,"I mean, uh."
10_PHIL,"You know, I I'm a- I'm a-. I'm aware of a lot of the things that are going on. You know."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,"I know that you're getting ready to leave, and Pat's doing things so, I'd better let you go get her."
10_BRAD,Yeah. I know. Okay.
10_PHIL,And we'll continue this.
10_BRAD,"Well, yeah. There."
10_PHIL,"In some manner, but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want. But I think."
10_BRAD,"No, that's fine."
10_PHIL,If we can.
10_BRAD,That's fine.
10_PHIL,If we can go ahead and carry on.
10_BRAD,Um.
10_PHIL,"At some point, you and I I think."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,Because.
10_BRAD,"One thing that comes to mind is, is the, well the question of meeting quarterly, is that enough. Meaning having, you know the."
10_PHIL,It would be enough if committees were to meet.
10_BRAD,"Uh, uh, If committees yeah... and that's the."
10_PHIL,But.
10_BRAD,That... that's... that was Paul's uh desire.
10_PHIL,And I think.
10_BRAD,Was uh.
10_PHIL,That's what we wanna talk ab-...
10_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
10_PHIL,We'll talk about that there too. And say look.
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"You know, is quarterly... you know, we- would we need to meet every other month."
10_BRAD,Mhm.
10_PHIL,"You know, do we need t-... do we need to meet, you know."
10_BRAD,As a full board every oth-... w. We shouldn't have to.
10_PHIL,We shouldn't.
10_BRAD,"If the committees, uh."
10_PHIL,But these committees need to be active.
10_BRAD,Function properly.
10_PHIL,And to do their things...
10_BRAD,Right.
10_PHIL,"Basically, you know, the publications committee, needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish..."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,You know.
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,They need to become somewhat self-sufficient. Collections committee...
10_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
10_PHIL,"Needs, you know. I would like to create collections committee to be something where we're almost matching."
10_BRAD,Yeah.
10_PHIL,Uh Funds they can raise maybe.
