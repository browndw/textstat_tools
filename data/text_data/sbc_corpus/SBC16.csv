16_TAMM,"Well um, I wanted to say I'm really happy with the stuff I got now."
16_BRAD,Good. Good.
16_TAMM,And I'm really basically I'm back for a tape deck.
16_BRAD,Oh okay.
16_TAMM,"So um, one of my thoughts is, that um, well, I want a tape deck that's gonna sound about, you know, as good as it can."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"And I think I want a tape deck with two... places for two tapes, so I can copy."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,But I've never done this before. I don't know much about tapes. I mean I h-.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"I have a boombox, you know ordinary sort of thing."
16_BRAD,Sure.
16_TAMM,"So, I wonder if you would suggest that this Luxman is the-... is w- one of the things you'd wanted me to think about."
16_BRAD,"Uh, Um, the uh. Would you... you would want the... the ability, uh, of the double cassette deck, just purely for taping from one tape to the other."
16_TAMM,That's its main purpose. In fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it uh would have.
16_BRAD,"Oh okay. The other benefit is, is if, you can load up two tapes in it, like, let's say two ninety minute tapes of music."
16_TAMM,"Unhunh, I see."
16_BRAD,And you can set a switch on it.
16_TAMM,I see.
16_BRAD,Where it will continually play.
16_TAMM,Okay. Okay.
16_BRAD,"All four sides, of two tapes."
16_TAMM,I see. That's probably not gonna happen.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,No. It's mainly for copying.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,So.
16_BRAD,"And the tapes you'd be copying, uh, are they gonna be straight music."
16_TAMM,Mmostly.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"So you are gonna want, or desire a pretty decent, uh, copy of your original tape."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, right."
16_BRAD,Okay. Um.
16_TAMM,"And the originals will be from music lovers, you know, who probably have, pretty good systems. Not."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,I'm... we're not talking stratosphere.
16_BRAD,Sure.
16_TAMM,But.
16_BRAD,Sure.
16_TAMM,Anyway.
16_BRAD,Okay...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"Um, because on a, um, a tape deck like that, you realize, that you're not gonna be able to get a copy that's, you know."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,As perfect as.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,The original source was.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Or even as that tape was.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,There is gonna be some loss.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,In the generation of making that copy.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And.
16_TAMM,Is there a way to avoid that loss. I mean how...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,<XX>.
16_BRAD,"Well, you're you're gonna have that loss, just because of all the different things involved."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"F- from, taking it from one tape, and putting it on the other tape."
16_TAMM,Right. Right.
16_BRAD,There's a lot of things in the signal path there.
16_TAMM,Right...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,So you're you're bound to lose something.
16_BRAD,Yeah. It's not huge.
16_TAMM,No matter what.
16_BRAD,"You know, it may be ten percent."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"Or, five percent."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Or something like that.
16_TAMM,Right. Right.
16_BRAD,"Uh which is a small amount, and, you'll st- still be able to enjoy the... the music, and the message it's trying to bring across."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm, mhm, okay."
16_BRAD,So.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"I don't see a problem in that. Um, the other thing I realize is, uh, think about how much of the time you're gonna be doing that."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Because of-. You are paying a decent premium, to have that convenience."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm, mhm, so what kind of price difference are we talking about. Suppose I just get one tape."
16_BRAD,"Oh, okay..."
16_TAMM,And let my friends copy tapes for me and.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Um.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Like let's say there would be about...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"Um, couple different steps... Okay."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"One would be, a single cassette deck..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"Um, that would, uh, play the tape, you know, and after side A's done, then you have to take the tape out and flip it over, and play side B."
16_TAMM,Okay. Okay.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,That would be your first level.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"And Luxman has a great cassette deck, to fill those needs."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,And um...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"All of their cassette decks come with a five year parts and labor warranty, so the quality's."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"You know, put into them. Uh."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"They really put a lot into them, to be able to give that kind of warranty."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"And um, they're pretty conservative in their, uh, specifications, where, what they say their cassette decks will do, they will y- usually out perform that."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"And, with the unit you already have, the receiver, that has the full remote control."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"All the units, uh, you're looking at here, will, uh, go along with that."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"And, um, as far as the remote control funtions go."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Where the remote control will control the decks.
16_TAMM,Right. Right. Okay.
16_BRAD,The decks come with...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"What's called a DIN cable, and that plugs into the unit you have now."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, right."
16_BRAD,Okay this is the kay one eleven.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"This would be, I guess you'd say the entry level."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,To integrate into your system.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"Um, this gives you, a lot of pluses that, most people's basic decks don't have."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"Okay, it has Dolby."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Which as you know, that's a circuit to cut the tape hiss, without cutting the high frequencies."
16_TAMM,Right. Right.
16_BRAD,"And um, uh regular Dolby is Dolby B. That's like um."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"When you buy tapes at the Wherehouse, they're in Dolby."
16_TAMM,Right...
16_BRAD,"Um, in addition to that it gives you Dolby C."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"When you're making your own tapes at home, like let's say from the CD."
16_TAMM,Hm. Mhm.
16_BRAD,Making a tape to play back on this tape deck.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,You're gonna wanna record it in Dolby C.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,That's gonna sound sonically superior.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Um, or if friends are recording tapes in Dolby C, then you'll be able to play it back and it'll sound right."
16_TAMM,Hm. Okay.
16_BRAD,"Okay, so if something's recorded in Dolby B, you wanna play it in Dolby B, Dolby C, you wanna play it in Dolby C. You don't want to."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Mix and match. Uh.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,The-. It doesn't sound quite right.
16_TAMM,Nkay.
16_BRAD,So this gives you that.
16_TAMM,Hunh.
16_BRAD,It also gives you what's called HX Pro.
16_TAMM,"Okay, mhm."
16_BRAD,"Which is a feature usually only found in, r uh, really expensive cassette decks."
16_TAMM,Mm. Hm.
16_BRAD,"And that i- is, an improvement in the recording section of it."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,And it allows you to record a little bit.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Um, higher record level, so you hear less tape hiss."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm."
16_BRAD,"And also has a little bit more, um, high frequency response..."
16_TAMM,Hm. Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Okay, so this one here you're looking at three hundred eighty dollars."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, hm. Mhm."
16_BRAD,"Okay, and um, from there, the next step, for what you're looking at, would be the kay one ten. Okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on the- on the kay one eleven."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Um...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"With the addition of, the convenience feature of having auto reverse."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"And that's nice, just like in the car..."
16_TAMM,<XX>.
16_BRAD,Where.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"It will play uh side B, after side A is finished, automatically."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Where you don't have to get up and flip the tape...
16_TAMM,okay.
16_BRAD,"The other thing about it is, you can flip the tape over at any point in the middle."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, right."
16_BRAD,"Uh, and, the other thing, y- let's say if you're entertaining, you can put in a ninety minute tape."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Put it on continuous auto reverse.
16_TAMM,M mhm.
16_BRAD,Have a recording of your favorite songs.
16_TAMM,Right. Mhm.
16_BRAD,For a party.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"A dinner party, whatever."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"And, play side A, then side B then side A side B."
16_TAMM,"Yeah, that's good."
16_BRAD,It'll just go forever.
16_TAMM,That's good.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,Um.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,So that's what it gives you in the kay one ten...
16_TAMM,mhm.
16_BRAD,"Now, the, dual, or double cassette deck, that Luxman offers, is basically, a um, double version of the kay one ten."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,And they call it the kay one ten double-u.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,Uh And-.
16_TAMM,So what's the price difference here.
16_BRAD,"Oh okay, I'm sorry, the-."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,The kay one ten is four hundred eighty dollars.
16_TAMM,Alright.
16_BRAD,"And the kay one ten double-u, is five hundred eighty dollars."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, okay."
16_BRAD,"Okay. So you paid a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse, then you're paying another hundred dollars to have."
16_TAMM,"Yeah, right."
16_BRAD,Double cassette deck that's auto reverse.
16_TAMM,"Okay. Mhm, okay."
16_BRAD,"Um, the convenience on this is obvious."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Where, um, they even have..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"Um, you know, buttons set up for."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Dubbing, or copying."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,From one tape deck to the other.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Um, so it's really set up, to be just cranking out."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"Uh, copies."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Now the other thing is, it has a feature where it will do it in half the time."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,Or high speed dubbing.
16_TAMM,Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm.
16_BRAD,"Which is sometimes nice, so it doesn't take the whole period of time."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,To make your copy.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"And it will continue making the copy, you know, from side A then, and it'll flip over."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"And to side B. Um, so we... we've talked about it, how uh... how it has the dubbing speed select buttons."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"So you can make a, a high speed copy."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Um, The other thing that sets this apart, from a lot of other dual decks, is it has a separate Dolby button, for each cassette deck."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Ge-... uh gesundheit.
16_TAMM,Thank you... yeah.
16_BRAD,"Um, where a lot of units will."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,Just have a Dolby setting.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And that's the same for both decks.
16_TAMM,I see. I see.
16_BRAD,"But there may be a situation, where a friend of yours."
16_TAMM,Yeah. Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Who's a real audiophile, made uh."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,A real premium tape for you.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Recorded in Dolby C.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Well, you wanna record it in Dolby B, so you can play it back in your Walkman."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And in your automobile's cassette player.
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm."
16_BRAD,"Uh, in that scenario, you're gonna want to play it back in Dolby C, but record it in Dolby B..."
16_TAMM,Yeah. Okay.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,That's good.
16_BRAD,So this gives you that convenience.
16_TAMM,Nkay.
16_BRAD,"Now the other thing is, let's say, um, that friend of yours came over for dinner with his prize tape."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And you had your prize tape.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Of of something else, you could load them both up."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm."
16_BRAD,Put it on continuous...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Um.
16_TAMM,Unhunh.
16_BRAD,"Auto reverse, and it will play side A side B of one tape..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Go over to the other tape.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,And play sed ai.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Side A, then side B, and it continually go forever."
16_TAMM,"Right, Okay."
16_BRAD,Um.
16_TAMM,Hunh.
16_BRAD,Which is kinda nice.
16_TAMM,Wow.
16_BRAD,Now the other thing you can do with this deck is.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"In your system, you can make a copy, from tape to tape, while you're listening to something else..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Nkay.
16_TAMM,Unhunh.
16_BRAD,So you could be listening to your CD.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,While you're making a tape copy.
16_TAMM,Right. That's right. Okay.
16_BRAD,"Um, the other thing you can do is, um, as I recall, one can listen to the tuner..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,So you could put on KDB.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Or I. I-.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"Uh or there's one Matt likes, I forget what it's called, but anyhow."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Um...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Or he wants to get KFAC I think it is.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"Which is kind of tough. Um, so you could be listening to the radio, while taping a CD."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,You- you know.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,It allows you to do that.
16_TAMM,Right. Right. Okay.
16_BRAD,"Which, you have to pay attention to what you're doing."
16_TAMM,Okay. I know. That's right. Yeah.
16_BRAD,"Yeah, but at least you have that flexibility."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,And so it sounds like...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"From what you've told me, uh, uh you know, about you're desire to make, good quality copies of tapes."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm."
16_BRAD,This is gonna be the tape deck.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,That would fit your needs.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"And integrate well with your system, and."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Allow the remote to fully control it.
16_TAMM,"Okay. Well what you've said helps me a lot. I actually may, I mean, I don't do this so often. And it may well be that I. I'd do better, just going back to one of these others."
16_BRAD,Mhm.
16_TAMM,"Um, in."
16_BRAD,The oth-.
16_TAMM,"In fact, I'm."
16_BRAD,"The oth-... the other thing I was gonna say is, is it... do you have, um, if you had some other type of quality cassette deck."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Even if it was a, unf-."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"One in the office, or uh."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, yeah."
16_BRAD,A portable or something like that.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,I could somehow hook it up into your system.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,So you could tape from it.
16_TAMM,Right. Right.
16_BRAD,"To, one of these."
16_TAMM,"Right, okay, that's possible."
16_BRAD,"And, the-... the prices I gave you were the, uh, Luxman suggested prices."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Since you've bought couple pieces here.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"And also been through the fire, I'm sure we can work something else out for you."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,I don't know.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"How well uh, uh, let's see here, um, the kay one eleven, which is the... the basic one."
16_TAMM,"Right... but uh, I don't. When I say basic, I mean basic in their line. Right."
16_BRAD,It's still very good.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"Uh, you'd be looking at three hundred forty-nine dollars..."
16_TAMM,nkay.
16_BRAD,"The, uh, let's see here, the kay one ten."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Uh, we could do four hundred and forty-five."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"And the kay one ten double-u, uh we could do five thirty nine."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, okay. Well, that looks great."
16_BRAD,"And I th-. I believe, there's one that we didn't talk about, and that's the kay one twelve."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Okay, and the kay one twelve is basically the audiophile's dream cassette deck..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"It's a... it's a single cassette, and it's single direction."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Where it doesn't flip over by itself.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"What sets it apart, is it has three discrete heads."
16_TAMM,Hunh.
16_BRAD,"Okay, and this will make a superior tape copy."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"Um, or a superior tape period. Um."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,Because it has three heads.
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"And what it does, is that it has a separate head for record, a separate head for play..."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,Where most decks have a combination record play head.
16_TAMM,Unhunh.
16_BRAD,"And uh, um, this also has some adjustments on it, uh such as bias fine trim."
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"Uh, which allows you to, tailor the cassette deck's electronics, to the specific tape you're using."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,So obviously you can see there's uh.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,A b-... a bit more involved with it.
16_TAMM,Yeah. Yeah.
16_BRAD,"For the purist, this is the way to go. Here you're looking at six hundred dollars."
16_TAMM,Okay...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,"Okay... Right. Okay, well this is very helpful. Let me ask you one other thing..."
16_BRAD,<XX>.
16_TAMM,"Suppose that, I wanna use this tape deck, to record, um, conversation. Like we do in... in linguistics. Between Matt and me, or something like that."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"Then, how does it work. Let's say go back to the kay one ten."
16_BRAD,Uh.
16_TAMM,Or the one.
16_BRAD,"There's one deck here, I think, that's set up for that."
16_TAMM,Or the one el- eleven.
16_BRAD,Let's take a look here. The kay one ten.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Has provisions, for microphones, on the front."
16_TAMM,Unhunh.
16_BRAD,And it's one of the few cassette decks.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,Made for the consumer hi fi market today...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,That do have that.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"And so, you can plug in one microphone."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"Uh, where it has a position, uh, that's mono."
16_TAMM,Mh-hunh.
16_BRAD,And it will record it on both tracks of it.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Uh-.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And then if you want.
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"You can plug in two mics, and it senses when you plug in the second mic."
16_TAMM,"Hm, okay."
16_BRAD,And so it'll record in stereo...
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,And then it has a record level on it.
16_TAMM,Hmhm.
16_BRAD,So you can adjust the record level.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Dependent on how loud you're talking.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And then also the type of tape you're using.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And the level you want on the tape.
16_TAMM,Hm. Hm.
16_BRAD,"Uh, so the kay one ten would be set up for that."
16_TAMM,Hunh.
16_BRAD,"Any of the other, um, cassette decks here."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,The kay one eleven has it too. I Take-.
16_TAMM,Hunh.
16_BRAD,I-. I take it back.
16_TAMM,Huh.
16_BRAD,I didn't think the kay ele- lev- one eleven did.
16_TAMM,"Unhunh, unhunh."
16_BRAD,Okay it's the... it's the dual one that doesn't.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,The dual one does not have those provisions... now that doesn't mean that it cannot be done.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"What has to happen then is, uh, one hooks up a."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"A separate outboard piece, called a microphone amp."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"Okay, and so what happens is, your mic runs into it."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And then it plugs into your receiver.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Into one of its inputs.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,And so one of your inputs on your receiver...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Let's say tape two.
16_TODD,Paul.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Would actually be a microphone.
16_TODD,"Run, run."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_TODD,Yeah.
16_BRAD,And so you would hit that.
16_TODD,Yeah.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"And that would, um."
16_TODD,Paul saved my ass.
16_BRAD,Go over.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Um.
16_TAMM,Nkay.
16_BRAD,"Into your tape deck, if you wanted to record a tape."
16_TAMM,"Right. Right. Okay. So um, m."
16_BRAD,"So the kay one ten, which is the single auto reverse."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Has the mic provisions.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,The kay one eleven has the mic provisions.
16_TAMM,And so's the kay one. Okay. Great. Okay.
16_BRAD,The b-... the benefit of the one ten. The big benefit is the auto reverse.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Um.
16_TAMM,I'm one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse.
16_BRAD,Oh yeah.
16_TAMM,"I don't know why. The first time. I mean, this is the first time I've had it, on my boombox. And for some reason, maybe I just have to learn, when I put the tape in, I never know which direction it's gonna go. So I have a hard time finding..."
16_BRAD,What you want.
16_TAMM,Making it play what I want it to play.
16_BRAD,Okay. The way it usually works is...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Um...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,The side of the tape that's out. Or facing you... that label side.
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm."
16_BRAD,"Corresponds with the arrow, that will point to the right. There's usually two little arrows that will light up."
16_TAMM,Nkay. Yeah.
16_BRAD,Telling you which direction it's playing.
16_TAMM,Right. Right.
16_BRAD,Okay the arrow that points to the right.
16_TAMM,I see.
16_BRAD,"Is, the label side of the tape that's facing you."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,That you can see.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,Okay that's the way it usually works.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,Now the other thing that throws people off is...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Fast forward and rewind.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Will vary, depending on which side of the tape you're on."
16_TAMM,Right. Right. Right.
16_BRAD,"Okay, that's what throws people off."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,All the time.
16_TAMM,"Yeah. I just um, I'll. I'll work on getting used to that. But I just might go with the single... you know, the one that I have to turn it over."
16_BRAD,Oh.
16_TAMM,I mean.
16_BRAD,"Uh you know, that's fine."
16_TAMM,You know.
16_BRAD,That's fine. Um...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"I'm trying-. I mean I had a couple recently, uh, Bodeckers, uh, got the kay one eleven, and-... and they love it."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,They don't play tapes that much.
16_TAMM,"Yeah. That's the same with me, too. Yeah. I'm really into CD's now."
16_BRAD,"Unhunh, yeah."
16_TAMM,So.
16_BRAD,But they have a couple of these box sets of uh...
16_TAMM,right.
16_BRAD,Symphonies.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,And then I think they even have a couple books on tape.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,And for that it's perfect.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"You know, it's probably w- more than enough."
16_TAMM,Right...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"Um, I'm just trying to look and see what other differences there are."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"I- I mean, I really think those are the... that's the big difference."
16_TAMM,"This is. No, this is great."
16_BRAD,"Um, doo doo, I believe, yeah. I think that's the basic difference, is that auto reverse..."
16_TAMM,"Let me ask you, do you sell microphones..."
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Here.
16_BRAD,"Uh, we don't really."
16_JONA,Nya nya nya nya nya nya.
16_TAMM,Kay.
16_BRAD,Get into them.
16_TAMM,Nkay.
16_BRAD,"Um, we are."
16_JONA,Nya nya nya nya nya nya.
16_BRAD,Um.
16_JONA,You can't get me.
16_BRAD,Connected with a distributor that does deal with them.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,And so we... we've gotten them for clients time to time.
16_JONA,Try to get me.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"Um, I think we have them available from Sony. And, I'd really have to l- research that a bit for you."
16_TAMM,That's okay. I. I can follow through on that. You have any idea how much a good.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"Sort of um, table mic would cost. Um."
16_BRAD,"Well, um, you can get one..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"F- uh ah s-. I would say, I would expect to pay, maybe f- f- forty dollars, and up."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"I mean really, the sky's the limit with microphones."
16_TAMM,Right... right.
16_BRAD,I mean you can get.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,N-... thousand dollar microphones...
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"But, um, you would proba-. I would spend, you know I wouldn't spend nineteen dollars."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm."
16_BRAD,I'd spend forty bucks.
16_TAMM,Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
16_BRAD,"And then, maybe a little up above that."
16_TAMM,"Nkay, mhm."
16_BRAD,"For what you wanna do, I- I don't ever see paying, you know, a couple hundred dollars."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,That... that would probably be.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,F- very overkill.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,So that kind of gives you an idea.
16_TAMM,Mhm right...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"Um, there's a place to look, um, called Sound Advice."
16_TAMM,Yeah. Alright.
16_BRAD,"Okay, there's a guy there named Wayne."
16_TAMM,Yeah. Okay.
16_BRAD,He's uh.
16_TAMM,That's a good idea.
16_BRAD,One of the principals there. Wayne.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,I think his name is Shaybeck.
16_TAMM,Alright.
16_BRAD,"Saybeck Shaybeck, something like that. And he's a really knowledgeable guy."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,He's been in the business for a long time.
16_TAMM,Great.
16_BRAD,"Uh, and they're good guys there."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"So that would be, a a place to look at a mic."
16_TAMM,"Okay, that'd be great. Yeah. Um, if we needed to d- get a price on a tape r- recorder, that we lost. See what we lost was a tape recorder, not a tape deck..."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,It was a fancy Uher. That name rings a bell.
16_BRAD,Are y-. Oh really. It was.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Oh gosh.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Th- that's...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Like.
16_TAMM,But.
16_BRAD,"Considered, I mean there's a lot of different models of Uhers."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"But uh, they've always been considered, probably one of the finest portable cassette recorders."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, mhm, yeah. Right."
16_BRAD,Uh w-... our blue book usually shows the Uhers.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Our older Uhers.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,So I could show you what the blue book price was.
16_TAMM,Then if I. Nkay.
16_BRAD,It's gonna be hard to d-.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"I don't know Uhers that well, it's gonna be hard to determine."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,What would be a comparable replacement today.
16_TAMM,I know. Right. Yeah.
16_BRAD,And that would be something you may wanna run by Wayne.
16_TAMM,Okay. Great. Nkay. You don't sell that kind of thing here. Right. Cause this is an audio.
16_BRAD,That's right.
16_TAMM,Place.
16_BRAD,Well I mean.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"To tell you the truth, th- sometimes we do get them for people."
16_TAMM,"Mhm, okay."
16_BRAD,Through the distributors we deal with.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,But uh.
16_TAMM,Yeah. Okay.
16_BRAD,Overall.
16_TAMM,Well.
16_BRAD,Usually we don't.
16_TAMM,"This is great. Yeah. What I think I'll do is um, take these ideas back to Matt."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,And I'll be back.
16_BRAD,Sleep on it.
16_TAMM,Then yeah.
16_BRAD,Yeah.
16_TAMM,Yeah. I need to think about what you told me.
16_BRAD,Uh.
16_TAMM,But this is very helpful for me.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,I really appreciate it.
16_BRAD,"Just for your knowledge, um..."
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,The kay one ten... and the kay d- one ten double-u.
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,That's the auto rev-... single auto reverse.
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"And double auto reverse, we have in stock."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,The kay one eleven.
16_TAMM,Hm.
16_BRAD,"Um, I don't believe I have in stock, but we're gonna be placing a Luxman order soon. And, since they ship out of Torrance."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,"Um, you know, lead time isn't too bad on it... but just know that."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,You couldn't call me up and then listen to a tape that night.
16_TAMM,Right. Okay. That's fine.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"Okay. Um, but, we're talking like maybe a week or something."
16_BRAD,Oh. Yeah.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,Yeah.
16_TAMM,No problem...
16_BRAD,If that.
16_TAMM,I mean listen.
16_BRAD,If that...
16_TAMM,I'm not that uh.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Th- the timing isn't that tight. I've waited a long time.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"For a lot of stuff, so, no."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,It's not a big problem. But I appreciate your letting me know about that.
16_BRAD,Okay. Okay. Um.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"Pete had told me Matt came by, and picked up some literature on, I th- guess the l- l-... s- the little speakers, y- we were talking about."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,"I don't, I don't."
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,"I don't know if he actually got the exact one I recommended, or not."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"And then, uh, there was an article on uh, FM antennas, I had recommended to him."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,And Pete made a copy of it for him.
16_TAMM,Yeah. Okay.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,That's great...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Yeah. That was really helpful.
16_BRAD,So. Do you-...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,"Had you heard anything, ha- has he read that and he's thinking..."
16_TAMM,Right.
16_BRAD,Thinking.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Okay good.
16_TAMM,"That was part of what we had to That was part of what we had to put in the specs. We needed to know the size, and this whole antenna question, whether you could put an antenna, you talked about this with him."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Un-... under the roof and everyth-.
16_BRAD,Yes.
16_TAMM,Cause you know. You can't have that stuff showing.
16_BRAD,That's right...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,That's right.
16_TAMM,Not where we are.
16_BRAD,Yeah.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,Uh.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,How's the house moving along...
16_TAMM,"Coming along. We're gonna be, putting the uh, specs out for bids."
16_BRAD,Great.
16_TAMM,Within the month. So.
16_BRAD,Great.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,That's progress.
16_TAMM,"So, that's."
16_BRAD,Isn't it.
16_TAMM,It's progress...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,"Yeah. We're going as fast as we can. We're gonna have, like, four weeks we just have to wait. While the bidding."
16_BRAD,Exactly.
16_TAMM,"And um, but <XX>."
16_BRAD,"Well, then if, then if you sit up at night thinking."
16_TAMM,Then.
16_BRAD,Should we go for him.
16_TAMM,I know it.
16_BRAD,Or should we go for him.
16_TAMM,"It's just what I was telling Jeff. I said we got all these places in the specs, where we're... we're having to say, you know. K-. Figure this one separately, cause we may have to axe it. You know. And we're just, biting our nails, cause we don't know, what th- the bottom line is gonna be."
16_BRAD,Sure. Th-. Yeah.
16_TAMM,"So, maybe uh, anyway."
16_BRAD,Some parts of it will really surprise you.
16_TAMM,Yeah...
16_BRAD,"And some parts will, be a lot less than you thought."
16_TAMM,"Yeah. Like windows aren't as expensive as I thought. So, it's."
16_BRAD,Oh.
16_TAMM,That's how it's going.
16_BRAD,Well that's good.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,"Well you have to do, double glazed up there now."
16_TAMM,Yeah. That's true...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Right. Yeah.
16_BRAD,"Um, which some t-... which adds a bit."
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,To the cost goes up.
16_TAMM,"Well, we'll keep you posted on."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,How it's all going.
16_BRAD,Just let me know.
16_TAMM,"And I'll certainly let you know about this thing, um, I'll be calling you back."
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Within a few days.
16_BRAD,And I-. I think I had given you some literature before.
16_TAMM,Yeah.
16_BRAD,On that. And it shows those cassette decks in there.
16_TAMM,Okay.
16_BRAD,If you need an additional piece.
16_TAMM,That's right.
16_BRAD,I can. I- I can get you one.
16_TAMM,Uh no you're. I think you're right.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,"Yeah that's what I had looked at. So, I think, is w-... no. You don't have the."
16_BRAD,I have the d- the.
16_TAMM,One.
16_BRAD,The double one here.
16_TAMM,Right. Right.
16_BRAD,And I have the.
16_TAMM,That's what I saw.
16_BRAD,"The real high end, um."
16_TAMM,Mhm.
16_BRAD,Single one.
16_TAMM,Yeah. Okay...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Alright.
16_BRAD,"The other t-... the other, the single auto reverse, I have in stock, I just don't have on display."
16_TAMM,Yeah. That's alright. Yeah.
16_BRAD,Okay.
16_TAMM,Okay. Good. Thanks so much.
16_BRAD,Well that gives you an idea.
16_TAMM,Alright. Good.
16_BRAD,Okay good.
16_TAMM,"I kept you five minutes, but I bet-."
16_BRAD,Oh.
16_TAMM,I bet it's been worse than that before.
16_BRAD,It's... it's. Oh. This is nothing...
16_TAMM,<NONVERBAL>
16_BRAD,Yeah. This is nothing. This is a joy.
16_TAMM,Hunh...
16_BRAD,To tell you the truth.
16_TAMM,Good. Good...
16_BRAD,<NONVERBAL>
16_TAMM,Well I think you've got another sale.
16_BRAD,Okay.
