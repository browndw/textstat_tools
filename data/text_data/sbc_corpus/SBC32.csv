They will take me into this acadamy, it's sort of like West Point and all this bullshit, and, they'll train me, and blah blah blah, and so he signed. Right. Well, it turned out, after the last dog was hung, that, that the highest casualties in the war were the merchant service."
32_TOM3,In the merchant marine.
32_TOM2,Per capita.
32_TOM3,Yeah.
32_TOM2,"Right, but."

32_TOM2,"I came back, I went to school for a few months, I was involved in uh, I was second mate in a ship at the uh, in Normandy, We made twelve trips from Southampton to uh the beaches, until we were in a collision, and then they sent us home, patched us up, sent us home, and then I came back into Italy, and we went into the invasion of south France, and we went across the uh, the Atlantic and Pacific."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,And the war ended then. And so I stayed in the merchant marines for another year or two...

32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,Um...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"I was more interested in, in reliving my youth, or living my youth, and."
32_TOM1,For the first time.
32_TOM2,Anyway.
32_TOM1,Right.
32_TOM2,Make a make a long story short.
32_TOM3,Sort of get a holding of it...
32_TOM2,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM3,M-...
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"When they posted the grades, in forty-nine, I, I immediately went to New York, and shipped out as second mate on the African Pilgrim..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"And went to uh, South Africa..."
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,<NONVERBAL>

32_TOM2,"Y- i- it was a it was a story. But she was a real ship, a two-hatch ship, based in uh, in, in uh, uh, in um, uh uh, West Africa. So I sailed on her for a little while. Um..."
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,And then in fifty...
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,Forty-nine I guess...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,Uh guy named Near-.
32_TOM3,Now let me stop you now.
32_TOM2,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
32_TOM3,Uh since you're of record.
32_TOM2,Yeah...
32_TOM3,"But, n- it's primarily because I wanna know, when you say you were sailing now, what were you doing during these different phases of your sailing life-."
32_TOM2,Da- I was sailing second mate.
32_TOM3,You were second mate then.
32_TOM2,Yeah. I was second mate on the African Pilgrim.
32_TOM3,Okay. Alright.

32_ELAI,So.
32_TOM1,"He's doing quite well, actually."
32_ELAI,I'm gonna go back in. Because it's chilly.
32_TOM3,Alright... uh.
32_TOM1,"You just didn't want to uh, think he might've fallen over the fence..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_ELAI,Right.
32_TOM1,Right.
32_TOM3,Or just go over the fence in the corn.
32_ELAI,Toppled over it. Right.
32_TOM2,Anyway I was sailing second mate in the Pilgrim.
32_TOM3,Right.
32_TOM2,"Um, this was American South African lines."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,"Um, and and, uh in forty-nine, I think it was, I got sort of fussy with that, the purser was a guy named Bob Heins, he and I decided that, well we'd sort of wanna do something more adventuresome, so we we jumped ship in uh New York, paid off. And we took a passage in the America, and went to Paris. I stayed in Paris for seven eight or nine months."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,My friend Bob Heins stayed for twenty years.
32_TOM3,Ah.
32_TOM2,He he sort of got hooked on that.
32_TOM1,He got. He uh he understood what was r-.
32_TOM2,Hmm.
32_TOM1,What was up and what was down. Right...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"Oh he married over there and, went to work and."
32_TOM1,He knew what was.
32_TOM3,He figured it out.
32_TOM1,He knew what the hell this world is all about.
32_TOM3,He figured it out...
32_TOM2,<XX>. Yeah.
32_TOM3,Yeah. Figured it out.
32_TOM2,"So uh I had a lot of interesting adventures there. And finally, when I ran out of money, uh, I wrote home to my family and said, would you be kind enough to uh, please send me a passage home..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,And they did. Well.
32_TOM3,Ah.
32_TOM2,"I was then twenty-five years old, so I, um, well I did what any r- red-blooded American boy would do..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"I took it down to the American... uh uh, to the uh US Lines and I cashed it. Right."
32_TOM3,Right.
32_TOM2,So I stayed on that for another month or two.
32_TOM3,"Mm, you stayed for life."
32_TOM2,"And then I wrote home and said, gee I'm..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"I need another passage home, and then."
32_TOM3,Somebody stole it.
32_TOM2,"They sent it- sent it to me, and this time when I went down to American Expre-..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"To US Lines and they said, well there's a hold on this..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,This can be only used for passage home...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"I said, oh."
32_TOM3,"Ah, smart family."
32_TOM2,"Oh. So anyway, I sailed home in the uh old Isle de France. Uh, got into New York, there was my mother and father and, and we popped in and it was, things were a little tight, and a little tensy, went home."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,"My m- grandma was there, my mother was there, we sat around the dinner table, and n- dinner was served, and finally my mother said, well tell me. What did you do in a typical day in Paris..."
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,Made the most brilliant move of my life.
32_TOM3,Uh.
32_TOM2,I said.
32_TOM3,And you said...
32_TOM2,Please pass the butter...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,And this subject's never been brought up since...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"Right, yeah."
32_TOM3,I like that.
32_TOM2,Yeah.
32_TOM3,I like that.
32_TOM2,Anyway. Uh.
32_TOM3,Very good. Very good.
32_TOM2,"Yeah. So that was forty-nine, fifty, I went to work for Grace Lines in New York, as a port captain."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,"Sailed in a couple of Grace liners, south, uh, Korean War started, I had the uh, I decided well shit. Might as well join the war. Threw in my hat. D- uh, uh, when I came back from one of those uh trips from down to Cartagena, I found a big stack of navy orders. Right."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,"So I went to this, m- what I thought was my friend, um, th- this navy captain down at ah naval headquarters. I said this is terribly awkward. I've just been promoted from third mate to second mate, and and could we uh possibly postpone these orders, for a little bit. My friend stood up behind his desk, in his full four stripes and said, Lieutenant. You are in the US Navy now..."
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,I said oh...
32_TOM3,<XX>.
32_TOM2,No one ever explained that to me before...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,And a week later I was on my way out to Korea... yeah.
32_TOM3,Oo...
32_TOM2,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM1,Where you got promoted really rapidly. Right...
32_TOM2,"Well, no, I uh v-. Finally uh, I, you know, after a couple months I got promoted Lieutenant, and you know, and that sort of thing, but uh, it was all."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,I loved the Navy. I really did like the Navy.
32_TOM3,Mm.
32_TOM2,It was just an exciting thing to do.
32_TOM1,So how many years there.
32_TOM2,"I stayed in the US Navy, seventeen years and ten months. And then I was forced out, because I failed a promotion to commander."
32_TOM1,"So, but all that service time you put in. Thirty-five, or forty years or something like that."
32_TOM2,"Well, but I'm am p-."
32_TOM1,Right.
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,"I'm on the retired list for pay, for twenty-three years service."
32_TOM1,Twenty-three.
32_TOM2,Yeah.
32_TOM1,That's. That's that's what I was trying to get at.
32_TOM2,So after all this happened.
32_TOM3,"Now is that because of World War Two, and the uh."
32_TOM2,No it's because of the f-... the way the Navy worked. And of uh.
32_TOM3,Mm.
32_TOM2,"So I went to this guy and uh, and and I was a reasonably hotshot officer in the, Pentagon at the time and, and I went to him and said, hey, how come this is happening, and he said well, there's, happens to five guys like you. Because the way the law was written. And we fixed it as of nineteen fifty-four. Instead of saying you, if you failed a promotion you re-, retire as of twenty years from your pay entry base date. Mine was forty-nine. Uh, they said, what we've now said is, you have to stay twenty years. So I said fine. So, handshakes all around."
32_TOM3,Mhm.
32_TOM2,Then I went off and worked for a couple of companies and.
32_TOM1,Mhm.
32_TOM2,"Uh, my my success in life, if I can say it is, is is, consists of two things. Skill and luck."
32_TOM3,Mine's primarily luck.
32_TOM2,Ten perc-. Ten percent and ninety percent's the right mix...
32_TOM3,"<XX>, Mhm..."
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"And uh, so anyway."
32_TOM3,Yeah...
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,I uh struggled along...
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"And uh, one damn thing another, uh..."
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,"And then one day Debby said we're moving to Santa Fe, and I said well."
32_TOM1,Now that was her s- choice.
32_TOM3,Sounded like a nice idea.
32_TOM1,Hunh.
32_TOM2,Oh yeah. Hey man.
32_TOM3,Hmm.
32_TOM2,It was a binary decision.
32_TOM3,Alright.
32_TOM2,I had no choice.
32_TOM3,Let me ask you a very important question.
32_TOM2,You know.
32_TOM3,And this is one that's crucial...
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,Yeah.
32_TOM3,Why did you put the extension on your fireplace.
32_TOM1,Oh yeah. To keep the make the fireplace work.
32_TOM2,Extension in the fireplace...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM1,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,No I didn't- d-. I didn't put an extension on the fireplace.
32_TOM1,He is-. He is a uh.
32_TOM3,No you didn't...
32_TOM1,He is a aerodynamic uh expert...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM2,No.
32_TOM1,On uh chimneys.
32_TOM2,The fireplace is the way we found it.
32_TOM3,Oh. Okay.
32_TOM1,Yeah.
32_TOM3,Well you didn't do that then. But somebody did before that.
32_TOM2,"No, it's it's a little thing that sticks up above the roof."
32_TOM3,Yeah hm.
32_TOM1,"Tom thinks that mine doesn't work as well as it should, because it should be extended like yours. He thinks it."
32_TOM3,Yeah.
32_TOM1,That the.
32_TOM2,No it should j-. We we haven't done a thing with it.
32_TOM1,It needs to be higher.
32_TOM3,You see because you get a down.
32_TOM2,No.
32_TOM3,Uh on Tom's.
32_TOM2,The outside of the house was exactly the way we found it.
32_TOM3,The uh. Oh. Okay.
32_TOM2,Yeah.
32_TOM3,Alright.
32_TOM2,Uh.
32_TOM3,"Alright, see Thomas, I tried."
32_TOM1,So whoever...
32_TOM3,<NONVERBAL>
32_TOM1,"Was living there before, that's the one who discovered they needed to do that."
32_TOM3,"Alright, now who was the guy there before you."
32_TOM2,Doctor Green.
32_TOM3,"Alright uh, is he alive."
32_TOM2,"No, poor old Green shuffled off."
32_TOM3,Oh.
32_TOM2,Uh.
32_TOM3,Oh my God.
32_TOM1,To Buffalo. Shuffled to Buffalo.
