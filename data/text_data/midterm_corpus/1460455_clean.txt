Whether it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, it's a complicated issue. Therefore, I'm going to explore reasons that support each kind of knowledge.
On a hand, I think that having a broad knowledge is very important today, because the job is very flexible. One day you work in a field, and the day after you work in another one. For example, this happened to my father. He studied electric engineering at college, and after the graduation he started working for IBM. It was quite predictable. But after a small period he accepted an offer from an alimentary company, and he became they international marketing director. I agree that it could sound strange, but it really happened. Fortunately my father had a basically knowledge of marketing, otherwise he would have missed this opportunity.
On the other hand, I must agree that if you want to work in some companies, as, for example, General Electric, or Microsoft, or again IBM, you need a specific preparation. Otherwise, they won't choose you between all the other people. Moreover, you have also to be the best in doing your job, if you want to be sure to find a good one. For example, one friend of mine has graduated in Biology, and he won a lot fo awards for his experiments. Obviously, he found a good job immediately, while many of his schoolmates are still looking for one.
After showing the advantages of each choice, my opinion is that even if you have to be specialized in one specific subject, is also important not to be focused only on it, but you must have a wide mind, because you can't even know what will happen to you in the future. Therefore, you need to be prepared to everything.
