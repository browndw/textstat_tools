I am degree with the sentence that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide because I Have travel without a tour guide and I have have so beautiful experiences I mean it"ve been so cool.
Of course I have travel with a guide tour too but when this happen the guide tour is always under pres ion of the time and you need to follow him all time and if you want to stop some times you can't and I don't know but I don't like to have tour guide.
In other hand when I travel without tour guide I can stop wherever I want and I can do wherever i want , and if I do not know what places are the famous of the city I can ask to the people who live in that place or i can go to a library and look in the internet the direction and then get a map and then I am ready to go wherever I want thus it is so funny because if I get lost I need to ask how to return and at the same time that I know the city I know more people. I know that it is a risk, because for example my friends an I are going to travel next weekend to Quarter to visit some friends well they are members of my church, but I never have been there and no body that know how to arrive to the city wants to come with us , so we decided to take the risk and we only have the map, the car and money, well I want to tell you that some times I feel fear to get lost or something like that but something inside of my is telling my "you can do whatever you want" ( and I know that voice is Good, and........he is going to care me). So we decided that we will travel without tour guide.
In conclusion despite is too risky travel without tour guide it is better because is too funny and you can learn of your mistakes.
