In my opinion successful people have always succeed when they have taken the risk. Behind every successful man or company their is huge amount of risk involved. Some people even believe that their is no fun without the risk.
For example if Gandhi wouldn't have taken the risk of his life and continued his work of that of a lawyer in south Africa,India wouldn't have been an independent country today.so for every successful mission to take place a risk has to be involved.
All the leading business companies of the world take a major risk when they invests into a new project. The new projects may or may not do well and the company might run into losses. But most of the successful people are ready to take this risk and most of them are successful in their plans.
Over the years the risk factor has been taken into consideration by all leading men and they take the risk into account even before they take up a business. But its annoying to know that these people who are mostly successful when they have taken the risk or taken a chance have been successful otherwise today we wouldn't be connected to the entire world through the internet if the risk was not taken.we wouldn't be doing so much with the computer if bill gates wouldn't have taken the risk and invested so much in only developing computers and its software.
People who are successful in share markets are prone to huge risk and losses but all the leading men in share companies take risk and are successful also. All the world leaders are also subjected to risk of their life but the don't step back from their posts. The are subjected to risk of their life from terrorists and opposition also but this doesn't stop them and they are all world class successful leaders.
In conclusion i would like to say that mostly people have been successful when they have taken the risk and they continue to do that rather than do what they already know how to do well.
