Some people think that the young people enjoy life more than older people, while others think that older people enjoy life more than younger people. I think that the young people enjoy life more that older people because they have a lot of time to do whatever they want and also they are not married.
I think that the young people can enjoy life more than older people because young people have a lot o time to do everything. Also I think that because young people enjoy life doing the thing that they like, such as, skiing, snowboarding and suffering. Also I think that the young people enjoy life because they always do the things that the old people don't want to do. Moreover, the young people have a lot of energy to do everything, one thing that the old people don't have because they felt tired about that.
However, I think that one kind of old people can enjoy life more than younger people, that is the old people that have a lot of money and are a little bit crazy. I think that kind of old people can enjoy life more or see such younger people because they have a lot of money to do everything that they want, so they don't care about spent money.
But for all the others that don't have a lot of money, I think that the young people enjoy life more because they are not married, so that means that they don't have any responsibility because they are alone.
I think that the young people enjoy life more than older because they have a lot of time, a lot of energy and also they can do whatever they want because they are not married, so that's means that the young people is free to do everything in they life.
