Successful people are often those who try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well but not always.
One the one hand, I think that trying new things can help someone succeed. Successful people are people who try to innovate and to make discoveries. For example, one of the most successful man of the last years is Bill Gates. It is because he has tried new things and he has found a new way of making computers that he is now one of the most powerful man in the world.
An other example of a man who have succeed by taking risks and trying new things is Henry Ford. He improved the way of working by introducing machines in warehouses and chain working in order to be more efficient. This new model has been imitated by a lot of firms because it was a good model.
But on the other hand, people who do what they already know how to do well can also succeed. For example, a person who would like to create a firm can create it by using all the technicians and the theories that he already known. If he knows how to use them very well its firm can be a real success without improving the way that already exist to built a firm.
An artist can also be very successfully by painting very well for example that is to do well what he knows to do.
According to all these arguments, I agree to say that successful people are those who try new things and take risks. I think that people who only do what they already know how to do well can only have minor success. Because you can succeed by doing what you know to do well but the success won't have the same repercussion in the history. The success that everybody remembers are success linked to risks or innovations.
