I like travel and I have been many different city, counties. If the travel group have an amazing tour guide, it will be wonderful experiments. Because maybe I can make many new friends during the trip, and learn about the history and knowledge of the place where we stay, and greatly my short life will highlight by the memorable trip.
However, what is the best way to travel? It could be great plans and cue guys or else other. And what kinds of tour guide is an amazing tour guide? It is funny and rock question, 100 people must have 120 various an wear. We can not solve the problem to the rates, because the an wear is not we expecting and controlling. If we want to have a best travel, fire we must make a completely plan, which contents the time we will spend and the place we will get and the money we have to prepare for.
Second, you will considered the traveler with you. If you like travel alone, we have no many idea to discuss travel in a group. So, you have to considered how many people in the group and decide whether join in the group. In my opinion, the people in the travel group are my friends. We can give hands to others when he/she is in the trouble. We can work together, live together, share the beautiful views together and have some parts of memory together. Actually, after preparing period, the people in the group can find each other 's excellent point. And learn to others.
Finally, I belie it is a good way to travel that in a group had a good tour guide. It will be you, will be me. Just we can make the travel to be a great experience.
