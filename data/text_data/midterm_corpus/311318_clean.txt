First of all I would like to write that I am in complete agreement with the statement. Let me say some of the reasons that support my decision:
Since there are more innovations and new thing coming in, the young people spend their time doing things that in the near future do not contribute with the development of their community.
As an example I would like to say some examples about what the young people of my country do at the moment and what the young people did before.
I remembered when I was at the school, the teachers took us to different places of the city in order to do social activities with the poor people, we brought them food, toys, clothes, and it was really satisfactory for all of us. In addition to all this activities, at the end of the school, I mean in the last year, we had to do a social project whit the community and it was a part of the grades at the end of the year, but anyway we did that for other reasons...."help the people". However, after to have finished the school, I still carry on with this kind of activities and some of friends also do that yet.
On the other hand, when I look at the young people now, I get surprised how the life change and how the activities that we used to do it before do not exist right now. What the Doug people are interested in?.... Go to the disco, play x/box, Playstation, internet, watching T.V, etc. And some others activities that do not contribute with the integral formation of the person. I think that much of the behavior the young people have, are coming from the rapidly change of the world. However we can not forget that we do not live alone, we live with other people that probably need our help and we have not realized yet..
