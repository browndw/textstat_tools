The statement about most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.I agree about this point, I agree because this is from my experience in my life, when I saw some new product advertisement from the television, it always attract me, and I felt a rage from myself, I want to own that product.I want to become the same as they show it on the television, but when I saw them from the shop or when I purchased them, I found not very effective or same as they advertise. For example. The shampoo, we always see the model show their hair in the advertisements , it look like a falls. Beautiful, shinning, but when you buy and use it, no doubt, totally different hair from the Advertisement, I think the same or similar examples are not difficult to find in your life.so most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are.so some people will say, it is fake, it destroy the rights of customer, but this is a strategy of business. When they use some computer technique to change amid make much better than original product, it will encourage their product an opportunity , people see their new product's advertisement and it appeal people, then hay will go to the shop , that is an opportunity to let the people" feel " their product and that can see what it is looks like , they can touch that product and hay will consider about hay willing to buy it or not. Advertisement is not a directly way to show the quantity of that product is good or not. It just want make interested of people and appeal ham, and let them know that product, and give an opportunity to touch and get close to their product. This is an strategy of business.
