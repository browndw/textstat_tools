I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.There are many reasons that justify this fact.Most young people are robust and full of energy and this gives them an advantage over old people.Enjoying life means that one can be able to do all that he or she feels like doing at any time without any restrictions for example taking part in a sporting activity, traveling, spending time with friends.Most of these activities require one to be physically fit.
Young people do not have the same responsibilities as old people do so this will give them more chances of enjoying life for example old people have to be careful how they spend their money because they have a number of things to pay for; electricity bills, mortgage, their children`s education ... But young people who still live with their parents have no bills to pay so whatever money they earn is directed in paying for fun trips, fancy mobile phones and the like.
Another factor that justifies the above statement is that young people are more outgoing than old people do.For example young people are very willing to take part in new adventures that old people wont be very much at ease to do for example skating or parachute jumping or even motorbike racing.Ola people will consider such activities as dangerous whereas young people will see these activities as a big thrill.
Companies that produce musical gadgets like walk mans, Compact disc players, MP3s consider the young people as their biggest customers so they model these gadgets in a way that only young people can use them easily and thus such technological advancements don't favor old people making young people enjoy life more than old people.
Lastly, young people enjoy life more than old people when it comes to health issues.Young people are very resistant to abrupt changes in weather and their immune system is stronger than that of old people.For example young people can comfortably play in the cold without having any problems but old people cant.
