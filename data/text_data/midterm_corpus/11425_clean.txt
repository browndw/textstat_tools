I read, I forget. I learn, I still forget. I understand, I remember. This translation of a Chinese proverb says it all. A strong and sturdy base is mandatory for every building to stand tall. An understanding of things is like a base to a human being in the building of his life.
It is obviously more important to understand things that it is to learn facts about them. It is this understanding of a particular topic or a phenomenon which encourages an individual to analyses things occurring around him or her. This can be clarified better as we take a look at the following examples:
For instance, we consider the example of an electrical engineer. He has learn from the book facts about domestic power supply. But he has not understood how the process of delivering power is taking place. In case of an emergency, if he is required to tackle some power problem, he wouldn't be able to repair it, or trying to troubleshoot it might even prove fatal to him, if he does not have an understanding of the fundamental.
Considering the example of swimming would not be difficult. If a person has learn the Archimedes' principle of buoyancy, it obviously would not help him swim. But it would only be possible if a person understands how to swim under proper guidance.
All the research experts and scientists around the globe are responsible for new innovations not because they have mugged up facts and figures relating to their area, but because they have created their own facts and laws using their understanding of the subject.
Considering the above examples and illustrations it can be very well said that - It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. For only this would bring them up as better individuals and better thinkers who would help in development of their country.
