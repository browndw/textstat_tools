I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Personally, I think that people who are 60 or older would enjoy their lives much more that younger people, especially people who are between that age of 16 to 50. I agree the reason for being young is to have fun and enjoy life, but that does not mean that only young people can have fun, and older people would definitely have boring lives. For example, my grandmother who live s in China is 70 years old, but I have never heard her complaining about her life is boring. Even though she lives alone at home, but she still has her social life like I do. She signed up for a ballroom dancing class at the local learning center, and goes there three times a week. Since then, she has made many more friends, and because she is very good at dancing, she feels that is the place that she belongs to. As for me, I have made friends in my school since i moved here, and I constantly Hang out with them. Another reason I think that older people would enjoy life more than younger people is because most of the people who are 60 or older are retired, they don't have to work anymore. Which means they don't have to deal with the all the pressure from work or schools, perhaps the relationships between co-workers and bosses. I can see that every night when my parents come home from work, they always look exhausted, but they still have to cook, and finish the rest of their work after dinner. They also have to face other problems such as mortgage, bills, my college tuition and more. On the other hand, my grandmother, who is already retired, she does not have to worry about things like that, she can just relax and enjoy the rest of her life. Therefore, I do not agree with the statement and I think that older people can enjoy their lives even more.
