I definitely agree with the statement exposed before, since my experience showed me that understanding ideas is more important that just learning facts.
I think that building models of events and things is the only way to study what surround us. Since I am studying engineering I will bring two examples dealing with my field.
If you can elaborate a mathematics model of how an engine works, than you will be be able to produce it and maybe also to understand, if there would be a damage, why that kind of malfunctioning has occurred, which is the first step towards an improved engine. While if you only had seen somebody building an engine, you will also be able to build one following the same steps but you would not be able to understand neither how the engine works nor why a damage could occur in certain conditions, or what is due to.
Also if you have understood a concept you could probably happen to apply it to many different events.
For example if you know what gravity is and why it works, will be able to apply your knowledge to tons of experiences. You will then understand both the reason of apples falling down the three when mature and not going up in the sky, as probably Newton did when he first explained this phenomena, and the reason of the moon rotating around the Earth and not leaving his pattern because the equilibrium between the gravity strength and an opposite strength due to his speed.
Anyway I think it is very important not to loose the contact with reality. I mean that elaborating abstract models which do not have now and will not have in the future any concrete application it is an usefulness thinking. This is the risk of giving more importance to ideas than facts: finding ourselves thinking to the best idea, forgetting none of them will be then playable to what is our final purpose.
