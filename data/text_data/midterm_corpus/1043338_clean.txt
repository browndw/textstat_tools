Successful people try new things and take the risks rather than only doing what they learn already know how to do well. Is it true!
Lets take it from the beginning of a baby just burn. At the first of his life he wants to touch everything around, even it's hot. He doesn't know, but he take the chances to try and learn what can this thing reply to him.
If we look to the small people we know what is inside the big people. They would to take the chances to learn everything. So they feel the successful feeling. They touch the happiness in winning.
No person can learn if he afraid the thing. How experience get to his mind if he stop searching and keep working on what he only knew.
Lets talk about my self. I'm at marriage age right now. So my feeling is to experience the word marriage. I know what does it mean, but I do not feel what it is mean. I have to go throw so I can feel the new experience. Should has a kettle fair, but we need to win the life game.
Another example I new is a rich man. How did he become a rich! Money does not come from the sky. By the blessing of GOD,
He take the risk to try to feel how to be a rich by giving all the money he has and took some of his friends. He Entered a new thing. He success with paying back the many he owns to his friends. Also reaching the level of rich people.
How is the pilots learn to fly. He took the risk and grab the yolk to control the plane even he know the he is doing something dengue. To clear a successful we should take the risk and do a new thing we may learn from the first, the second or the third. But initially we learn.
