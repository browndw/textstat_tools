Mostly there is two kinds of people. One is trying to do new things and takes risks. On the there hand, people like to do only thing they know it before without taking any risky things. Each kind of these people have their reasons. I will discuss more about them in this assay.
First of all, people who like to do new things and to involve in risky things, i will call it a " risky man". This man have the feel of challenge .There fore , he likes to do risky and strange things and he enjoy it. For instance, a man who like to claim mountains, sailing a round the world or, for more risky , swimming from country to others. Why do the risky man do this things? Properly he want to grant a huge number of money and to be a famous and unprofitable. Further more, most of these people you can find them in ginned record.
Secondly, people who like to do normal and usual things, i can call them a "calm man". This man like to live in peaceful and calm life. He prefer to have a happy family than making risky things. Plus, he think that person who do a risky things is crazy. More over, this calm man usually have a job with loving partners. How ever, he rarely go on trails and trips.

Finally, i think being a risky man it is not good due to the risky situations that he faces during his life. Also, being a calm man is not good too. His life is very quite and boring. In my option is that complaining between the two personality is better. So then from time to another you can make little risky and new things like sampling about or building a wooden house. More over, having a nice family with a good job.
