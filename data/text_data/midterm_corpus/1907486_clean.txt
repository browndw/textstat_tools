Actually, I think that right. The person who try new thing and take the risks is success most the time. I faced some personality to enhance my situation but that was need risk. And most the time i blame my self but that no benefit me. Last try and risk to me is this exam. I don't have a trust with my self in the English language but i knew that if i don't take it today i will lost lot of time. That was about my experience but our life and with other experiences the humanity start from the try and somehow with the risk. Some of their try not for help them only, but also to help the humanity. I read Once about the Flying in the sky and i asked my self "If there is no one have an encourage to try flying, how we can travel?". There is always an answers and part of answered there is a risk. Right's brother had the money, time, science and most important was the encourage to do that. They take the world everyday around the earth to remember humanity that the risk part of our life but we must woke perfect to be successful.
I have a note. There is lot of people take the risk and success but also the is people failed. That not means "we must rest and don't try". The experience born from the failed and also try again. But we must asked our self "Why ailing?". Surely there is wrong may in planning, instruments, not enough money and also because we not trust with our self. That will be differ from the success people and Failed.
In my religion all the people from all the world must take the reasons (science) before start to risk to have a result.
