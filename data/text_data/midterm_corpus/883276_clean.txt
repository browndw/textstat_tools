First of all I have to admit that it is very difficult for me to say if I agree or disagree with this statement. In my opinion it is a very important thing that young people give enough time to helping their communities. But young people do not and neither do I. I do not have any time to help my community because I spend most of my time at university and I have to work ver hard in my free time, too. I can understand why young people do not want to help their community. The first reason is that young people do not get money for this work. Perhaps if they got money they would help their community. Another reason is that young people only want to enjoy their life. They do not think a lot about community.
Another reason could be that young people want to discover the world. They do not want to stay with their community.
Perhaps it is possible to lure young people to help their communities. If there were good conditions they would help. And if some young people began this work other people would follow. So if many young people were involved in this help they would have fun together. Furthermore it is necessary to make a lot of advertisements for helping the community.
But from my point of view you have to see the facts. As I mentioned at the beginning of my essay young people are not interested in helping their community and I think it would be a really difficult briefing to change their behavior or opinion. And I think there are other people who have to help the community, for instance the major.
So, in summary I have to say that I am a little bit sad about it that I can not help my community very much. But I can understand people who do not have any time helping their community or do not want to. From my point of view young people have to solve other problems than helping their community. But people who do not have a lot work to do might help.
