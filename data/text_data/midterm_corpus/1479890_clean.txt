First, I must say I completely agree with the statement. It is quite relevant in the education of a country, and about it and its consequences a huge controversial has been opened at the mannish University.
I think everyone accepts that understanding the concept and far more important, being able to get to the facts by yourself using that concept you've learned at class, is what University should use for. In other words, they should teach you how to use your capabilities. In the professional area, what you will need to do is apply what you have learned into completely different cases. You will never find the sames specifications of the problem you got when you were studying. You could pass your exam, but you won't be prepared for the real world, you will feel completely naked when you'll find your first problem.
In my case, that I'm an engineer, it is completely useless to know how to resolve a specific problem. What I need to know is how to face it, what steps I should take and then work through it to get it done. Each time I'll need a different technique to resolve it, but I should always take the same steps, analyze, decide best options between a brunch of possibilities and finally use it.
Then, what is the problem? Why don't teachers work that way? Basically because it is much more complicated to teach concepts and altitudes that facts. The fact is written and it doesn't change. They just need to read their 'magic' teacher's book and copy it. Someone else did the investigation before. Instead, to teach concepts, first you have to understand it properly, investigate, you need to get involved in the classroom. All this means complete dedication and a huge preparation. And what is more important, I think you need to love what you are teaching. Another aspect I think a lot of teachers are just there because they didn't have the opportunity to develop their career in their real area.
