The fist cars start circulate during the first world war, but this cars were just for rich people. After the second ward war, people feel better and had the possibility to had a job and improve their standard of life. Ars factory understand that the car will be the symbol of wellness of the mama society, and start to project cheap and smart cars that a normal family could bought. Since this years, cars developed in their structure, in design, in confront , and the in number! Today a family composed by four people has two cars, one for each parents. In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for irreverent reasons.
For example, when one of the sons can drive a car, usually use one of his parents car, but sometimes boys that can buy a car just for themselves.
This is a big problem for the health of the world. Today we can see the big metropolis in the world. There is too much traffic of cars! In this enormous cities people can't walk in the street, there is too much smog in the air and they can't breathe. Traffic is also very noisy, this is the main cause of acoustic pollution. Our cities are growing up very weekly and the situation that we can see today in the big cities will be also in the small cities and in the country.
Car factory try to design new motors and new cars to control the air and the acoustic pollution that cars caused, but if the number of the cars will grow up, this not solve the problem.
I think that every people in the world have to be something about this and can do something to stop this direction. I have the possibility to buy a new car but I will use my mother's car until I will need my own cars. Every one can use public transport and government have to do something to increment people to use it.
