I think there are many way to trip. But I think travel with just a few people is much better. There many reasons can support my thinking. One of the reason is travel with group led by guide, people should adapt their thinking. The travel in group can be contrast to working in company. Working in company I should follow my leader, so I can't do what i want to do very well. Also it just contains my opinion little bit. But working in own business or small business, they can share there opinion, and they can have discussion, they can find best way to solve. The trip with few people is same case as working in own business. Trip with few people, they can share there idea also they can choose best way to enjoy there trip.
Another reason, travel with tour guide, I feel not comfortable. I should follow the trip route which planned by tour guide, also I should be part of the group. For example, I trip the France for have great time in Eiffel tower in Paris. If i trip with group led by a tour guide, the tour guide will set up the schedule for trip but there are just 3hours for touring in Paris. So i can't have enough time for Eiffel tower, and i tour in another region that im not interested in. And it can cost much more than travel with few people. Because you should pay for tour guide, and the hotel which chosen by tour guide.
Last reason, people can develop their responsible and ability of independence by traveling with alone or just few people. And it can be more exciting. Because you should have to ask to the people in that region and search about that area. Sometime it makes you cost money and time but it can be good experience to you.
Therefore travel with few people or alone is the best way to trip and have fun in trip. Also trip is not just for fun, you can learn the culture by searching that area.
