Ya,i definitely agree with this statement.Particularly i believe that, the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.In this aspect,a successful people mean that, they already familiar with most of the issues.They mostly concentrate mainly on new inventions or new things to show that or to prove that they are also good in all the subjects or things.That too, the selected thing mostly will have greater risks and fluctuations.But, his/ her success mainly depends on achieving the selected thing or goal.
In my view the success in any person hides mainly in selecting the new interesting thing and the way he/she achieve it.Even if he/she fails in trying new thing, they will be well known that, the method he/she adopted is a wrong one, and he tries for the another. And i strongly believe that, mostly successful person try new things rather what he/she already know how to do it well. Right? If the same known thing happened to do repeatedly,he /she may get success in that particular thing only, and he/she connotes try a new thing.In this scenario, how can one think that he/she is a successful person.And i strongly disagree with the statement that, successful people do or attempt old things what they already know how to do it well.The success in trying new this and achieving them, proves him a more successful person than before.Getting success in new things that are risky proves him/ her a lot as a successful person rather in succession the same in a well known thing and which is not risky.
Let us consider with an example, now we all well aware that ,Thomas Edison has invented Electric bulb.He adopted several experiments in the proceed of invention of Electric bulb.Earlier all of his Experiments are failures.But,atlas he succeed in his invention and also learns that all his failures are the wrong methods that should.
