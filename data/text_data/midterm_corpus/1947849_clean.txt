I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because I believe that the people who have strong wish to be successful, are more likely to be successful.
My father is a business man who works for the Japanese company. When I was young, my father's job was to trade oil, and the company asked him to go to NY with family to work there. When I arrived NY with my mother and father, I was surprised because the other business man who worked there were at least 10 years older than my father. I asked my mother why, and she told me that my father is one of a rare case. He always suggests new things and try new things that the company has never done, so he is working with older people who is working much longer than my father. When I heard of it,I thought it is good to challenge new things rather than only doing what I already know.
There is another strong example which I have seen in television about a week ago. I was watching the Japanese TV program which is about successful people in Japan. On that day, they were showing about one singer who is very popular in Japan now. In the program, he said that he was actually a business man when he was twenty years old, and suddenly he quit his job to be a singer. He loses his job and had a very hard time until the famous music producer found him, but he said it was a priceless time which was crucial to his life, because he still remembers those times and he even wrote a song about that time.
Due to those reasons, I strongly belie that people who try new things and take risks will be successful. Even though they have difficult time before being succeeded, you will learn things from that time for sure, and your success will be even more valuable.
