Nowadays, young people are more involved in many activities than in the past. For this way, someone can affirm that young people don't give much time to help their communities. Because of I'm a young person, I can explain my opinion and I can support my disagreed opinion with some examples. The first example I support, is that young people have not so much time to help their communities because they don't wont to help them, not because they haven't such time: in fact, I can help my friends if he ask my an hand, even if I have to study for myself. If I am beloved to a friend, I help him in every way. But in this way, I have to renounce to spend some time to play the computer or to have a pause, going to commercial center, or running, for example. I supposed that the people that said this sentence, know just selfish people, that think just to their life. But in university, for example, students live together much time: they stay at the same lessons, they spoke in pauses times, they have a lunch together and they become as a family. In a family, if a member has a problem, the others help him. And in this way occur in university. In fact helping each together can consent to pass more simply the exams, and live the university life with no fear. Also in family young people help fairly well (and more than sometimes or seldom): in fact as a young person grows, his responsibility grows itself and he recognize that helping parents is important. They can do it in different ways: working in spear time, to learn some money to spent for their personal object, and they don't ask money to their parents, or cleaning the house or their own room. Naturally, exist many of young people that don't help in none of this way their family, but I can't generalize. As the man who said that sentence can not generalize.
