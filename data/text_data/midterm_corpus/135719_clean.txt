Along with the development of mass media and mass culture came the development of advertisement, helping to create what is called "the consumer society". Advertisement is supposed to make you buy a product, it is a message that makes the product appealing so that you buy it. In order to do so, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
It is a very common experience to be disappointed by what you just bought. I just bought an MP3 player because it looked great on the advertisement but I discovered that it does not work with many computers.This is the time when one says "it looked so much better in the commercial". Advertisements are not to be blame for that because it is their very purpose : to make you buy. In order to do so, it has to show what is best in the product. It is very rare to see a commercial that will ill- speak of a product. It does exist and it is called "negative publicity" but even this is a form of advertisement. Most of the time an advertisement will just focus on what is great about a product.
If advertisements sometimes make products seem much better than they really are, advertisements are not allowed to lie about the product. If they do, the advertisement company can be sued for "false advertisement". That means that an advertisement never really lies but just shows the product in a way that makes you want to buy it.
Having realized that it is the very role of advertisement to show products under their most appealing appearance, perhaps one should consider the consumer's responsibility. Indeed one should not always take for granted what is said in a commercial. It is his responsibility to use his critical sens and not be misguided by advertisements. This is a lesson I learned the rough way !
