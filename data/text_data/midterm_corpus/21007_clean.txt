The reason that the younger seems to enjoy life more than the older generation is that they seem to have a greater ability to make what they desire for to come true. This could be because of the greater energy levels that the younger generation has when compared to the Old.
The second reason is the flexible attitude that the young can wear. They are easily adaptable to the situation and change accordingly and make the most of the things, but on the contrary the old are not that flexible. They do not want to change from the normal routine work that they try to. They are very much used to the old work that they always do and thus they miss enjoying on other works which they can. Example a group of young people when they are out would always like to try out new things which they have never before done but old people are always end up doing things that they have always been doing.
But on the contrary enjoyment would mean differently to different people. The old grandpa of two children would find great pleasure in telling a story to his little grandchildren. The old person would find immense pleasure in that and that enjoyment can not be neglected. The young may consider it to be boring but not the same feeling is carried by all. The old person would have tried all that the younger generation is presently doing and now is just enjoying by looking at how the young do it. Even that may give immense enjoyment to the old. The old person would enjoy to the maximum when he is around with his family and sharing things with them.
Thus it can be concluded that the meaning of enjoyment is differently viewed by different people and cannot be weighted on superficial appearances and has deep meaning.
