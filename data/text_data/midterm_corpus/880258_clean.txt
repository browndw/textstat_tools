One of the most difficult choices that a man has to front every day of his life is about when taking risks is useful and when it isn't. I think that taking dangers is important to reach an objective but it must be done with intelligence, because acting without the control of the situation could be very dangerous. For example I wouldn't go on the top of a mountain if I were alone and if I hadn't the means to complete my adventure. I think that sadly a lot of people front the risk in a way like this, for example choosing to invest their money in financial actions, whiteout having any information about them, or because advice by banks of other institutes, which give to client informations that he doesn't understand at all. Obviously, on the other hand, there are people that remain fixed on their way of living and fronting situations and this is not good at all. In fact, whiteout taking any sort of danger, how can they think to have the possibility to extend their knowledge to aspects that are not properly the one they are used to? In a working contest this way of thinking can't lead them to discover anything, while people who take some more risks could find better ways to complete a process or they could archives new tools for their activities. I think that the first way to live is more difficult but can provide much more satisfaction than the other one, obviously if risks are taken always giving them the right weight. In fact this can help you to discover and accept more likely other opportunities, also completely different from the one you are used to. I think that people who behave like this are more likely to be open and so they probably gain more informations then the other kind of people enriching their knowledge more rapidly.
