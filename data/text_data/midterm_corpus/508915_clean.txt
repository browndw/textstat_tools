Some people learn many academic subjects and they will get a broad knowledge of the subjects and some people learn only any specific subject of their interest.Those people who develops broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be helpful to people by sharing their knowledge.Those who choose specific subject and who will get specialized will get bored after some time because of sameness.
I undoubtedly agree with the statement as we learn to share to our knowledge.You will feel satisfaction only when you share the knowledge that you have acquired.If we choose any one subject and if we get specialized in that,we will not have much opportunity to share our knowledge, though we will have but very much less compared to the one with diversified knowledge.
Through broad knowledge on many subjects, people will not get bored as is the case with the person of depth of knowledge in a single subject.Whenever we want to change to any subject we can change to that subject and therefore there will be a lot of excitement in life.If the selected subject is no longer useful for the scientific progress in the next coming years then the person with broad knowledge will be on the safer side whereas the person with depth of knowledge in a single subject will be in a depressed state and he has to develop the entire knowledge of another subject right from the starting which is not that easy.
Person with broad knowledge will have lot of excitement in life,he can get specialized in any subject of his interest in the later part of his life.Whereas the person with depth of knowledge should stick to the subject that he had chosen throughout his life.
Because of the number of advantages that broad knowledge on many subjects delivers,I will undoubtedly agree with the statement as the life that we can lead through this is very pleasing.And the dream of the people to share the knowledge that one acquired can be fulfilled.
