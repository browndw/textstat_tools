"Need is the mother of invention" When needs change the things which are commonplace today change like a dream.Alternative solutions are found with inventions.So though it may sound strange after looking into the ever increasing sales graphs of the auto companies,I feel there will be fewer cars after twenty years than there are today.
Things are getting customized according to the needs of the consumers.Goods and foods are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call.Retail giants like Walmart and food kings like McDonald's are accessible over short distances. This things virtually eliminate the need to go out, drive and shop.
With the advent of internet, it is very much possible to work from home.With the means like video conferencing the members in a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe.E-learning has opened new horizons.Classes and even archives are available online.These things help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest, reducing the need to go out everyday.
Population is a huge problem faced by many countries as it is linked with the limited resources like land.It results into the heavy traffic seen on the roads. Most of the automobiles today run on petroleum products which are getting extinct.Also they depend on the political aspects like relations with some oil producing countries.We can have alternate solution for that like renewable energy like solar power but the effectiveness of it is still a doubt.
With the steadily increasing standards of living across the globe and Government policies improving everywhere we will soon have a better and faster public transports which will reduce the need for having personal mode of transport.
It may sound a distant dream now but we cant deny the possibility of everyone having a mini aircraft.It will make the cars a history.It sounds a fairy tale but so was the case when people talked of mobile communication before the invention of cellphones.You never know, need can create magic. So expect fewer cars on road in the coming years.
