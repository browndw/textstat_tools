As a matter of fact, the issue of whether successful people try new things and take riskier rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a complex Fahd controversial topic. Different people hold different views due to their distinct backgrounds and experience. But for my perspective, I think the people attend to success is not only due to their trying new things and taking risks but also some other instant. However, it's a key to succeed. If I must to choose one, I will choose the former statement. In the following discussion, I would like to give some evidences to support my point of view and give other examples the refute cursory opinion.
First of all, the argument can be presented to develop my position is that successful people need different idea of invention to build new things. Why I say that? According to the current rich man, about two third of them earn their fame from the new technological products. A good example may be found in the case that the most wealthy person is rich based on his courage to take risk for investing new technology. Under this circumstance, it is quite obvious that the curious enterprise is necessary for successful people.

In addition, there is another reason for me to choose the former statement. The reason is not far to seek that speed of investing is more important thing than past. For the realistic example, our families decided to sell cookies near our home, but there had another cookie shop to open earlier than us. Losing the advantage of the opening time, we were failed to invest the shop and lost money.
Consequently, considering the strong reasons and examples that successful people need the ambition to try new things, which sometimes intertwine a organic whole and become more persuasive, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that I support the former statement.
