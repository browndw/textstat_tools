I disagree, for me the best way to travel is by your self. Become traveling in a group leaded by a tour guide il not comfortable, and he will take you to the most touristic place, the most expensive pleases.
If you go allowance you will be able to see the real part of the culture and the real peaceful. For example, if you go to India with a guide he or she, will chow you the monument's but not the vigils...
You will not be fibula to taste every thing become hay will teal you that you will be sick...
But if you go allowance you can take your time in the stores and in the monuments...
If you go allowance you can talk to how you want... You can give money to the needy, but if you go with a guide he ou she, will teal you not to give them any thing.
Some peal like to be allowance. In a bus you ar not allowance and there are smells, a hindrance crinkling... Wen you go by your self, you are more relate then in a bus...
A guide will teal you to harry up and teak photos, but you are on a holiday, and you want to take your time ith?
If you go by your sell with just a travel bag you will mea men constant, rich and poseur lapel... You will lure much more by going by your self. The poseur peaceful will com and beg more wen they see a coupe of with lapel then wen they see just own.
So that is WY I disagree with the fact of traveling in a group leaded by a guide.
