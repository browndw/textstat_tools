Academic education has always been a debated issue because it deals with lots of purposes. One main point that is being more and more discussed is if it is better to acquire knowledge in many academic subjects or to specialize in a specific subject. We will see that even if a specialized academic curriculum can be rewarded, having knowledge of many subjects can help to be open- minded and can be useful in daily life and society.
First, avoiding specialization at school or at university permits to develop curiosity and to have an opened mind. Indeed, could you imagine what would be the consequence of only teaching biology to a ten- year-old child ? He would only focus all his life on that subject. I believe that is the same for academic subjects. We must learn a lot from others subjects that the one we are going to work on all life. Having classes of history or economics can help you to remain interested in different subjects.
Moreover, the more the knowledge is diverse the more it is easy to face real situation. Only learning at university does not always help to know how to behave in specific situations. By attending to a diverse range of courses, this lead to a faster adaptation and understanding of the environment. For instance, a manager should have learn different aspects of the economic business. If he only focuses on accounting, he will not be able to understand the Marketing team with which he will have to work.
However, it is necessary at a time to be specialized in one subject. To take the example of a plummet, he needs to be sure of he is doing to to work. If we didn't have to specialized, everybody should know how to produce a pen or how to repair a car.
Though I fully agree that sometimes it is relevant to specialize in a specific subject, I still believe that it is necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it permits to be curious and open- minded, to know how to behave in new environment and in daily life.
