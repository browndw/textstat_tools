It is often said that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Is it really so or has this statement no sense at all?
Whenever an advertisement is conceived, an important issue, a part from the commercial target being aimed at, is the impact given or the message to be transmitted. This naturally derives in a series of techniques adopted to produce the propaganda. Many of these techniques might seem to make products look better than they actually are and therefore spark outrage. Other do not instead, no doubt about that. So the question is, are most advertisements like that?
The answer relies on two issues. One regards logical interpretation of the statement, the other, simple observation of propaganda itself.
As a matter of fact, the meaning of the word 'most' should be specified beforehand. But let us not pay attention to this cynical point.
As for observation, it is obvious that the type of product being advertised has an enormous specific weight in the discussion. For instance, certain products such as medicines cannot be made to look like better than what they actually are, whereas magical fat- loss meals tend to be over- advertised and are likely not to work.
Of course, generally, advertisements tend to outline the positive aspects of a product. But this is justified by the nature itself of publicity. So, in a way, the phrase could be always considered as correct.
On the other hand, as what is being put into discussion is not the nature of advertisement itself, it would be fair enough to acknowledge the way propaganda is meant to be and proceed to reason not on the essence, but on the form of the problem.
In conclusion, the statement might be accurate or less accurate depending on the type of product considered, let still the nature of propaganda.
