I think, we are a human society and the human knowledge is limited. But there are a lot of exceptions. For me, knowledge in a yield is essential because it is the only possibility to prove we exist in our individualist society. In short Men are complementary and they have to specialize in a yield.
If we compare a situation with an economic situation, we can notice it is the base of the capitalism principle. We can find an illustration with the theory of Comparative advantage of David Ricardo. It is a theory which explain that a man has to specialist in a yield where he is the best in view to improve his capabilities.
However, it is not the same for all the yields. During Antiquity period, philosopher was doctors, mathematician, scientific in the same time. It was a point of view different of nowadays.
If I explain my situation, I prefer control one think in a ONE yield better than know much malformations, on several yield but no control one think. We are more six billion of people in all over the world, it is impossible to know all.
Nevertheless, broad knowledge in many academic subjects for example politics, histories, economics, science is an advantage because in the gathering with our colleague, friend, boss we can hold a discussion and say our opinion. The person who said anything is not respect generally. "who say anything, consent"
Finally I think we have to control capabilities and improve our knowledge all the days. The education is a process even when we will a responsible parent.
To conclude, with the evolution of society and the mentality, we have to strengthen our knowledge to have to compete with the other. Competitive is essential!
