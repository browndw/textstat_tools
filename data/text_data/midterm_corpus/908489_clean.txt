Do you think that your young son can handle at least taking the trash from the street if he saw it ? Our children today do not lot of simple things than our fathers and grandfathers used to do it proud. This is because many parents do not let their children to try and experience how it would be for them to help your communities and communities nowadays do not open the chance for young people .
First of all man y parents do not let their children to to experiment how it feels good when they help their communities because parents think that helping community is a waste of time. Even if the children try to do this kind of things their push them and tell them to concrete on their studying and forget about this kind of things , Therefore even the child has the intention to help his community his parents may let him down. As a resolute the child will do the same thing with his children when he grow up .
In addition communities are not in the same way they used to be. There are some certain customs that recent community think that they like a holy thing , no can talk about it and say his onion about it. Before communities were used to to live anon a way that everyone has his own duty and in sometimes when have ve a festival or something like that. But nowadays these habits have disappeared in some way and just egoists in some small communities who tell do as their fathers did. So , one of the response way young do not help in their community .
In conclusion , I want to say that young people do not do anything worth in their communities because of the parents way to look at this kind of thing and for the community way of looking to young do ops that they think it is not found for people.
