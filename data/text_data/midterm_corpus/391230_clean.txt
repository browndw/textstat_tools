I totally agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people. Young people have a lot of lifetime, healthy, and have many good communities.
The first reason is that they have a lot of lifetime. Most of people in my country, Japan, live more than 75 years. Therefor, young people like my age, 25 years old, we have more about 50 years lifetime. We can buy a lot of things with money; however, we can't buy any time.Time is one of the most important tings to enjoy our life so I think young people can enjoy life a lot.
The next reason is that young people are really healthy. To be healthy is really important to enjoy our life. If we are healthy, we can do everything what we want. We can do every kind of job what we want, and we can study a lot in everywhere.We can do every kind of sports to have enjoyable time, and can travel everywhere that we want. Even if we don't have much money to do entertainments or other things, it is possible to make money to do what we want.
The third reason is that young people have a lot of community. Young people usually keep in touch with their friends from their hometown, school, and so on. They both young and have a lot of time, so that they can enjoy a lot of things together.Also if we have a lot of community, maybe we can get a lot of help. It is really helpful and that can make our life going well, so that we can enjoy our life itself a lot. It is really fun to spend time with other people. To keep a good relationship with others can make our life great.
Thus I totally agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than old people.
