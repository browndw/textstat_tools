I agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead learning facts.
As I am a student, I interest in experience something and learning from experience many things. Such as for history study, I go to Europe and look around real palaces and buildings and learn about Renaissance and feel alive history. It is very exciting way to learn, however, sometimes I can't understand some part. From facts, we can get alive information and interest things but sometimes we can't catch what we want. As we travel Europe for history study, we should have lots of background knowledge for know about that. If we don't have any ideas or concept about art work, we can't understand art work during Renaissance period.
And sometimes facts make exception. Lots of experiment that done from many scientists make exception. Of course it could be new invention, however, the facts can lead scientists wrong way to learn about something. If some scientists did wrong lab and they believe that they are on right way. However, it is wrong result. It makes confusing when other people access to that ideas. They will confuse at which one is right. It is also same at solve the math problem.
So I think ideas and concepts are always be the basic. When we finish studying basic we can catch something fast and right way, and even though we faced with exception, we can prove it easily.
For those reasons, I prefer that understand basic such as ideas first, then later learning facts.Although I like to learn facts and enjoy the fact however, I usually try to learn basic first. And it is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.
