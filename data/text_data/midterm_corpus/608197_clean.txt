There are advantages and disadvantages of cars. I'll be discus advantages and disadvantages of cars.
First we look advantages of cars. Cars are important and they give us the power of transportation at the time we want. And also car creates a private place like houses. Cars are flexible. For example, if i want to go holiday now, i can use my car and i don't need to wait any bus or train. They are protect us crowded of mass transportation. And using a car gives freedom feeling. When you drive your car, you feel that you can go everywhere. Now new technologies are created and cars are going to more economic. New cars are working with natural sources like electricity and they are friend of nature. They work more silence. They are building with recyclable and stronger materials. Car produce thinks drivers safety and modern cars are very safe. In 20 years cars will be more trust able and safer than today.
On the other hand, mass transportation rising. Lots of people uses mass transportation and every day more people uses mass transportation. The people choose it because save lots of time it is faster than using own car and it is more economic. There lots of alternative, for example train, bus, metro. They save us the traffic chaos. If i want to go center of city i choose always metro because it is very hard to drive car in traffic and driving car takes more time. One more disadvantage of cars, they rise up the pollution level. Cars are more dangerous than mass transportation. There are lots of people dies every day because of human errors. May be future cars will be more trust able but there will be always human factor. Human makes errors very easy.
Finally, i agree the topic. People will see the advantages of mass transportation and disadvantages of cars. I also think that in twenty years there will be fever cars in use than there are today....
