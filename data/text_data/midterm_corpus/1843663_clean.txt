It is important that everybody enjoys their lives. But who enjoys more, young people or older people? In my opinion, older people enjoys their lives more because they know what the true enjoyment and freedom to do anything.
Firstly, adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what the true enjoyment is. Youngsters call playing computer games, going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life. However it is too small to be an enjoyment of one's life. Older people enjoys their lives in a greater range. For example, a head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit, directing people and going to dinner with his family, which are far more enjoyable that playing computer games.
Secondly, Adults have a freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy. For youngsters to enjoy their lives, there are numerous thing that are not permitted to do, such as drinking, traveling without parents. However, there is no such barrier for adults. For example, my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business. Then he told me that he would go to these beautiful places and would come back with better future. I, after listening to him, immediately thought of all the stress that I am getting from school and planned a travel alone. However, I could not make the trip because of my parent's disagreement. From that moment I deeply realized that I can enjoy my life when I grow up.
People say that enjoyment equals happiness. However, it is not always true. People can get fall into a trouble if they only seek for pleasure. This happens to young people a lot. However, older people are able to differentiate between enjoyment and temporary pleasure because they know more and experienced more, which is why they allowed more freedom. Therefore, older people enjoy there lives more.
