The argument of people's view about having broad knowledge or specific knowledge deserves careful consideration because it's such a complex one. Some people hold the opinion that broad knowledge of academic subjects will have more advantages than specific subject. In my point of view, I prefer having specific knowledge rather than broad one. There are numerous reasons why I think specific subject is good and I would in here explore a few of the most important ones.
First of all, we come from a collaboration society, therefore, we need lots of different specialist to improve our problems. It's even a tough job for a geranium to invent or solve everything we need. We also know that every people has its advantages no matter he is clever or not, therefore, it's better to specialize in one specific subject. If we do that, it will explore more specialists to contribute their capacities to our society.
Another essential reason why I advocate this point is that we can establish our countries' economic position by cultivating such specialists. For example, in the past, Taiwan, my country, is an agricultural country. Later, our ex-president, in order to make residents living better, tried to find out the better way to improve our economy. Finally, he found that computer, Internet would be the most popular products in the following century. Therefore, he planed a policy which about training specialists, encouraging them go abroad to learn the skills. Under such improvement, we transfer our economic system successfully.
There is an argument to be made by the opposing position. They might say that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will enrich people's view. But the statement I have presented above, I do believe it's the most valid.
