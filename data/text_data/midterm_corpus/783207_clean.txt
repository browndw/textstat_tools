According to my opening on argument evolves an approach int he direction of supporting the that Successful people try new things and takes risk the said aspects that title there by illustrating some factors that are magnificent to the points put forward as stated below.
Most of the successful people try new things and take risks.Because successful people mind is very shop they think differently compared with others. If they see ant new things suddenly asks him self 3QUESTIONS what ?, why?, when?. Then they start thing about the newly screened objets then they keep patents to learn about that.We know that "Room was not built in one day" and they take risks for that. As we know that "Where the is a way There is a will". They not live inthe middle they research up to end.
Form past we learn lot of things sin tests discover every thing now we are enjoying what hey discover.Sin tests are always successor they do not leave any one in the middle they fight up to reach the goal.That way they discover lot.They do not stop at the discovery off one thing, they search for next time more accurate one or else for any new discovery.
Successor or god gifted people their mind always think about new things and research for now ones. As they do like that now we enjoy all luxury things.Every one thing for new things but some peoples fight till end of the battle they are the Successors.
Try for new thing have lot of benefits than only doing already own to do well. For Example Robert didn't think about plain now we cant move from one city to another. Search for new things gives more calories life for the next generations.at the same time doing already know we can improve the performances in more accurate manner.
Searching for new things govern men gives more encouragement as it benefices to society.
Alto elaboration if argument has reveal success aspects and few draw backs over weight give.
