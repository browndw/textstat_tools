Nowadays, we are living in an individualism world. In our parents' period, it was really different, everyone helped everybody. Today this period is revolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough ti;e to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason of this phenomenon.
First, young people study longer than before. In average, a student stay at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60's or 70's. Young people always pretext they no have time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old,we, young people, always have the feeling to be over busy. We have personal work, group projects work, sports etc but in our planning, no time for so;thing else. Well, I say that but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we will prefer going 3 weeks on holidays than staying one week to help a recitative cause. There should have another reason of young people careless.
Secondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individual and egoist society. Everyone thinks about him or herself. Young people believe less in God than before, that could also be a good reason. There is not a lot of religious events. But the religion is a efficient way to Together people around a good cause in order to help other community. And all of it is just the consequence of the environment of a society or a lack of values, education.
Nowadays parents do not learn to their children to share.
In brief, I think it is not fair but it is a reality, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities but I a; sure.
