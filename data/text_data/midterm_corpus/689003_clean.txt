I do agree with the statement but with a few reservations, regarding exception. Young people these days are being more occupied with their priority, with this i mean, clearly, helping their communities is not their priority.
Why are the priority changing? A mother telling his ten year old child, not to let anybody use his geometry box. Their indeed is a need to think, where and whats going wrong. Child who is being constantly thought to be selfish cannot be expected to grow unto a responsible citizen. If not solely, the way the children are being brought up, is the responsible factor.
With the increasing competition in every field of life, and a constant reminder to win the world, is exerting immense pressure on today's generation, this is leads to lack of time, for the child to think of what should he be actually doing.
Exposure to the world through the advancements in the media and other sources, are giving a bigger picture of life to the children. With this they are able to locate where do they stand. There can be two ways a child takes it, freighter as a motivation or fascination. It is here that i justify my reservation in supporting the sentence. There are children who are motivated to help their communities, by understanding their problems through comparison with what they have learn from the advanced media. On the other hand the youngsters who are fascinated, which majority of them are, end up doing nothing for their community and the society at large. They tend to run towards what is fascinating and forget what they aught to do.
To conclude, i would say that the majority of youngsters do not have a strong eternal desire to do something for their community, nor do they feel responsible towards it. May it be because of the way they are being brought up. Of the way they want to be. But some are striving to man.
