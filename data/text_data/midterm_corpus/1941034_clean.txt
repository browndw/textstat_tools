I strongly disagree with this statement as the need for personal transportation will be even more in next twenty years than what it today is. Rise in the living standards of the people and faster life style would be the possible reasons behind this prediction. People are becoming more and more independent and solitary in their life style so the need for personal cars is going to be more.
There are certain things which may resist increase of the number of cars in future and one of those is the fuel problem. The major fuel for cars these days is petrol or other chemicals derived from petroleum. The amount of fuel we have under oceans etc is expected to last for another 100 years. So there will be enough fuel for the cars in next twenty years. But even then other types of fuels such as C.N.G and hydrogen etc are also used by car manufacturers now a days so it would not let the extinction of cars happen.
Cars are definitely going to increase in number on roads in next twenty years because they have been made safer now a days than they were before. With all this technical advancement and safety experimentation carried out at a war front level new models of cars coming out of the factories in future are going to be very very safe for the drivers.
Last but not the least, with all the above reasons, the reason which.
Might be the biggest and the most powerful reason behind increase in car's population on the roads will be affordability, the mass production and competition in the market is working towards cutting down the prices of the cars so down that the day is not far when even a common man would be able to buy a car of his choice.
The freedom of mobility, safety and affordability would increase the number of cars on the roads in next twenty years.
