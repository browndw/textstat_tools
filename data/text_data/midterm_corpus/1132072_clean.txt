I agree that Young Peoples enjoy life more than older peoples do. My first point which is most important is that , they are young. Since they are young they have lots of energy to enjoy by the ways they want. For example , if someone think he enjoy his life by playing some outdoor games , when he has a plenty of time. Now , if thinker is young person he can just grab his stuff to play & go on. But suppose this comes in a mind of an old person that not possible easily because he has to remind quick what kind of restrictions his doctor make on him. Also other point is lack of energy. He may not be able to perform that task even if he will enjoy in out door games.He has to compromise with things like just watching T.V or having family dinner parties , an easy way of enjoyment all older peoples prefer.
Also second thing which support my agreement is , traveling or trip which lots of peoples like & good way of enjoyment. When all the friends come together & make a plan for a long trip , is easy for youngsters because they are able to face all the kinds of problems starting from weather changes to walking a miles away by foot when there car is out of fuel. But in case of older peoples they need support in such kind of situations. They can not face as youngsters can. They need there medicines ready while weather changes happens & even though they are prep repaired , they are not sure that there body can respond well.
So , basically young peoples can enjoy there life more than older peoples as they have enough energy to enjoy by the way they want. But older peoples also have so many ways to enjoy there rest of life. As , at one time when they were young they also had fun.
