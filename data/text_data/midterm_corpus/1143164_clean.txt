Petrol is the main source of energy used nowadays but the problem is that scientist's researches says that there isn't lot of petrol still stored in the earth's crust.Most of the petrol which was underground was dug up.
People nowadays use a lot of petrol for their cars and they don't think about the future. They don't think what will happen when the petrol runs out!.The petrol drugged from the earth's crust is decreasing every day very rapidly due to the huge number of cars present on earth and the factories using petrol as a source of energy.As the petrol present decrease its price will increase a lot!.Sometime in the near future the price of petrol will be very high that lot of people can't afford it,so people will have cars but they can't afford the petrol!! IRONIC isn't it?!.
On the other hand,a lot of scientists are now devoting themselves to stop this crisis before it happens.so they are researching different sources for energy like solar energy and electric energy. There are other sources of energy that are being researched but electric and solar energy are the ones being focused on but the problem is that both this energy sources are not dependable.First, the sun gives out vast amount of energy but the problem is it is not available all day long. It is not available at night.Second, electric energy is a good source of energy but the problem is nowadays electric energy is conducted by conducts which work on petrol so that brings us to the first problem!!.
There is no definite solutions to the problem of petrol being finished, the only thing people can do is that they try to decrease the use of petrol now to try and stall this crisis from happening.So in my opinion in twenty years definitely there will be fewer cars in use than there is today.
