Nowadays there is great controversial over the time young people spend helping their communities. Many years ago, it was very common seeing young people helping their communities in activities such helpings in church, schools and so on, during last years old people have noticed it has decreased the number of youths who help their communities.
From my point of view, it is a matter of fact that the number of young people who helped in their communities has decreased in last decade. For instance, when i went to my church ten or fifteen years ago me and my friends helped to do all the things that the preacher man could not do by himself; but as we have grown up there are no young people who help in church and, in fact, the elder ones are those who help the preacher man in order to go on with the mass.
There are many reasons that can help to understand this problem. In the first place young people are so interested in new technologies that they are forgetting so important values such as family or friends. What i mean is that they spend so many hours playing with computers or watching TV that they forget what is really important in life which, i believe, is the people around you including family, friends and, of course, your community. It is obvious that if you do not care about your family you will not care about your community.
On the second place, we live in such a competitive society that parents do not spend enough time with their children to educate them in the same as they were educated by their eldest. As a result, young people have not received the learning of helping those around them.
If you ask to me, i think that the lack of help from young people is an important problem because it is producing a great desperation between the young and old people in their communities, and the only way to resolve it is give a better education to the little ones in order to avoid this problem in the future.
