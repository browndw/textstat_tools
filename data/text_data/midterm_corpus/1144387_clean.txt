I agree with this statement because it is a fact and even I am a youngster who is enjoying life. But if we consider the positions of the old they might not have much strength in their body and even in their mind to enjoy their life by visiting other places, friends, relatives and many entertainment places to spend their life.
An youngster can enjoy his/ her life by with his/ her friends, going out , going to schools, colleges, jobs but the old may not get this opportunity. Old people may not have patience, interest in particular things so many old people prefer spending their life in their home or in their guest houses playing with their grandchildren. Though going to schools, colleges might not be interesting to few youngsters but in my point of view it is still an interesting part of our life which if we miss we cannot get it back ever.
Studying new things is very interesting rather than sitting at home chatting with the neighbors and watching TV. And I guess most old people spend their time in chatting with another old person and even watching TV. Old people might not enjoy the new technologies and new inventions which an youth might be enjoying. I guess that even old people in those days might not have good education than this generation and might have missed many facts and details which this generation knows about it.
I hope that the advantages I have listed above are also a part of enjoyment in everyone's life. I hope that youth in today generation are in a better working conditions than the people at the past. Even that is too a enjoyment which the old people miss out because people in those days must have worked hard and toiled a lot but now we have machines for everything which makes our job lot more easier. Thus I conclude that young people enjoy lifer more than older people do.
