Young people clearly do not help their communities as much as they once did. But their change is mostly due to the change of the whole world and the society we live in. The last century has seen many technological revolutions such as television and computer and a consequent change was more than expect able.
Now that studies are getting so long for young the free time they could potentially spend for their community has been drastically reduced.
Big cities that have been growing all over the world lately have also somehow reduced young activity in a community so big that sometimes doesn't make them feel at home.
Now that the world is accessible to anyone and the young travel everywhere they loose the sense of home that someone that has always lived in only one village could feel.
That's why who lives in small cities knowing everyone inside them and staying there for their whole life has a much bigger sense of belonging at his town and is much more keen to help out anyone.
But that is not the only reason. Something that plays a major part is the education people get from school and most of all from their family. The new family model in the Occidental world completely degraded. Almost half of the over 30 years old people has been divorce at least once. Their support to the children can only be drastically worse than it once was.
People who grow in a solid family close to their brothers, their parents but also to their grand- parents and their old traditional values will without any doubt stay closer to their community.
I've personally got a lot of doubt about how this new condition can improve. I think a moral change is almost impossible and people will have to adapt. And yet families more reasonable are probably the clue to make a difference.
