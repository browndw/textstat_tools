It is stated by some that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
In time we have seen that the use of cars has increased and in my opinion, the possibilities of it decreasing are very low.
The automobile industry is just starting to developed and improve its self. They are finding new ways to satisfy a customer's needs and to attack a variety of people.
Nowadays there are cars for all types of activities, which come in many shapes, colors and sizes.
They appeal to the young generation also, making cars that are equipped with the latest technologies.
Family cars are much more comfortable and the image of the traditional sports car has changed.
Since people are becoming more and more concerned with solution, car manufacturers have been trying to come up with a car that works on natural energy. Of course, a car like this is really expensive, but it may soon become a most wanted car.
I believe that the car industry is evolving along with the needs of our times and is making out of cars a need to have object.
And as more people can afford a car, due to the economical improvement, sales will grow all around the world.
Car industry may one day reach places that are in state of poverty right now, but that in twenty years or more will step into a better economical situation. So this can only increase sales.
We are also finding new ways to connect parts of the world that have been isolated from the rest of the world. So as new roads to travel are made, needs to travel in will be extremely necessary.
Finally, I believe that in the future, although it might change its form, cars will always be used and even by a larger amount of people.
