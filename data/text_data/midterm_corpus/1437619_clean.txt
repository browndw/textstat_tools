Historically, to have a broad knowledge of subjects was perceived as part of a culturally enriched society. If we take a peek at the ancient geeks we see that all their main philosophers (Plato, Aristotelian or Socrates) were considered to be experts in many fields. But time has changed and nowadays specialization has become more and more important.
Having said this, I can't totally disagree with this tendency. I believe that in our modern society, if you want to stand out from the rest you need to specialize and become an expert on your area or field. A good example of this is what the labor market is currently demanding. If you don't have a job because you are not specialized or expert enough, how can you wish to have a broader knowledge?
Different is if, in your spare time, you devote it to persuade other academic knowledge, that's fine. But I believe that the real reason why many people choose to a very specific academic knowledge and a certain career path is because this will assure them the sufficient 'know how' they will need in th future tu secure a job position.
Educational authorities and responsible should have a say in all this. From my perspective the educational laws should provide the opportunity to the students to choose a wider spectrum of subjects as longer as possible. To be honest, this will not be possible always, there will a time that the student will have to focus in which path he or she will like to continue in. But the later we prolonged this decision, the better.
To summarize, if we lived in an ideal world we could all know about a lot of subjects but this isn't like this. The reality is very different one and we have to apply to it. The society wants 'experts' and we know it, so we play by the book.
