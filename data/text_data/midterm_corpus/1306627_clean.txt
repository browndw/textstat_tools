On the one hand, I agree in some ways with the statement saying that "young people enjoy life more than older people do" for specific reasons.
First, one can't deny that young people are healthy and it makes their every- day-life easier than for older people: less sleeping problems, many outdoors activities offered, etc.
Then, young people do benefit from an other important advantage: they have time in front of them. Indeed, such a situation helps to make plans for one's future. On top of that, young people can benefit from the fact that they do not have children and the responsibilities going with it.
Furthermore, life for young people often appears as easier and less heavy because of their easygoing way of being and thinking.
But, on the other hand, many reasons encourage me to disagree with the discussed statement and say that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people do.
Indeed, I would first underline the fact that older people often - but not always - have something very precious that youngsters do not have: maturity. And it is to my mind a great help to handle everyday life. There are many things I have done when I was young I wish I could do again with the experience I got since that time.
An other thing which also often lack young people: money. For insurance, It is quite a heavy situation to be a student, even if adults often forget this and only remind the good sides of their youth.
As a conclusion, I would say that enjoying life is not really a matter of age but rather the way one handle with it. It happens that youngsters with maturity, money and health really appreciate life, whereas older people can lack maturity and money. So there is no rule of age and enjoying age, I would rather say it is an every day work on oneself.
