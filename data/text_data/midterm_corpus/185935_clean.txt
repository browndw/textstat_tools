The incredible people are the young!
I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. As the youth of every living creature is full of energy, young human beings have the energetic power of living, too. They inspire life more deeply than the older people do. They live, think, speak and feel the life in a way more enjoyable than the older.
Life is full of activities and feelings that should be lived with more enjoyable ways. When we look at this sort of activities, we can easily remember the most activities done more enjoyably by the young. Music and concerts of any singers they most like to listen to. Dancing with many incredible musics performed by groups of known and unknown performers.
Sporting activities as football, basketball, swimming, rugby, tennis, ice- hockey, diving and so an. As you might have noticed these all sort of sportive activities are full of energy and enjoyable feelings.
Young people are full of adrenaline, a hormone being secreted from the organ of kidney. It is being inducted to be secreted whenever the body is in stress. Let me explain some situations for the higher levels of adrenaline in the blood as traffic accidents causing fear and real injury to the body, surgical operations performed for some reasons to improve the function of one or more organs of the body. But, above all, the young people have burst activities which means they can shout and get angry very easily. Additionally, they can enjoy very much in whatever they are doing. This means again high adrenaline in the blood.
To sum up, young people do not have much concerns for their futures. They feel, think and live in the way they much enjoy. It is clear that time passes without any hesitation and we are all getting older. I do absolutely agree and support that every one should learn how to enjoy life as the young do.
