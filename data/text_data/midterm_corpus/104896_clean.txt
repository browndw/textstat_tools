I agree with the most advertisements (ad) make products seem much better that they really are. There is two response such that ad's picture or TV comas hales are not same as real products, and ad have to show that the products are looking nice.
The first of all, most ad are over acting because ad's picture are very beautiful and look nice. For example, some bugger change restraint give us the ad on TV. In the TV, the buggers are very big and fresh, but real one is not look a like ad's. Also, car ad is as well as the burger ad because the car run in the mountain for faster but in the real life, normal car can not do that. So ads are shown much better that real one by create.
The next, ad have to show the products that are looking nice, so ads are made much better than real ones. The ad have to grab or coach people's interest, so ads are made nicer than real. For example, if a resultant give an ad to people, they make some foods picture. The picture are have to look nice. The pictures can not smell so create make some trick to look smell good. People look the picture. They think the resultant make such nice food and then they would go. So the ad is made nicer than real one because it have to look nice.
Most ads are made much better than real once because ad's and real product are not same because for example, the humdinger is not looking same as ad's. And the other reason is that the ads have to look nice because of advertisements. The ad have to frock the people as many as they can. Therefor ads' products and real one are not same.
