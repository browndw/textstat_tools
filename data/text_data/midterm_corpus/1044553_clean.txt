The years give us intelligence in most of the times. The statement , young people enjoy life more than older people no it is away true, it is depends of the style life, and personal habits.
For example, young people could be always, enthusiastic, happy, friendly and also serious, and quiet by the way some young people can not enjoyed their lives, may be, because their lives could be no the best experience, in the words may be they do nosy have the opportunity to enjoyed their parents, school, or wherever, in contrast many old people enjoy their laves, most of them thought that their old it the most beautiful form to accumulate experience, in this way they was have lot of memories and experience.
In my opinion, my grand father is an example that the old people can enjoyed life, same or more than the young people. My grand father is 86 years old and he decided star to lived again, when he was 75 years old, after my grand mother's dead, some people thought that he got sad but in contrast, he has decided to write a book, and all weekend he has dancing in a club, he already open his own cantina and recently he has a girlfriend and may be he will married again in a few months. However he has diabetics and hypertension systemic, he decided enjoyed his life and start again like a second chance. I think that he is a great example for young people that some times decide to quite their dreams, hopes, and some times their own lives. He is also a good example and a model for me, and I hope enjoyed my life same or more than him.
For this reason, I am degree whit the statement young people enjoy life more than older people do.
