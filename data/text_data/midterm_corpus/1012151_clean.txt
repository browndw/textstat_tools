I disagree that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than it is to learn facts. With this a do not mean that understanding ideas and concepts are useless, of course you need them for everything you do, like in your personal life, in your work, etc. The point that I think that is more important learning the facts it is because you are actually living in real life the problem. Understanding ideas may give the basis for the problem but many times when you are in the real situation it is not like they taught us it would be. Like for an example when you are studying in the college, they teach how the companies work, they give you all the ideas and concepts of what you are suppose to do in such situation, and many tools to resolve many problems in your professional life. But this is no even close of what actually happens in real life. When you graduate and finish school and a company hires you, this a different story. The problems are much bigger and stressing than the ones you study. For resolving this problems you have to implement all the knowledge you have study.
The facts gives you a wider vision of what is happening around the world. I think that studying facts gives you the knowledge and the experience to face the problems in you professional life. Experience is one of the most important attributes that a persona can have when you are looking for a job. This will help you to resolve the problems in a way a lot easier than your college and it could be a value that you your superiors would evaluate like a principle asset.
In conclusion a think that learning facts are much more important than understanding ideas and concepts, of course not making the second ones less important.
