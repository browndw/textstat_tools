In twenty years there will be much more cars in use than there are today, if nothing unusual like a world war happens. And the main reason to support this idea is just because the world's population is growing very fast.
In particular, the population of developing countries is increasing at a rapid rate, and many of these countries are attaining very high rates of development. Let us think about China: it has a population of more than one billion people. China's economic growth rate is 9%. Nowadays still many people in China is poor, but as long as the country continues to recover, more and more cars will be demanded. The same phenom is occurring in countries like Basil or India.
The fact that the amount of oil to produce petrol is limited and will no longer exist as the main powering source used by cars and other means of transport, does not imply that the amount of existing cars will be reduced in twenty years. First, after that period, there still will be petrol enough to be used by cars, and second, there will be other alternative sources of energy like hydrogen.
Like or not, cars are nowadays our principal mean of transport, even people do not use them in an efficient way. Many people go to their job by car, and prefer it to the public transport. But, for example, most of the times an average person uses a big car of four places for this purpose. This causes many traffic problems and pollution. To solve this new public policies are necessary to reinforce and to enhance the use of public transport by making it cheaper.
In conclusion in twenty years will be definitely more cars than today but they should be re-invented. They probably will be different: smaller (just for one person or two), they will consume less energy and use alternative- clean energy sources...This issue is related with our great goal as humans, which is to care about sustainable development.
