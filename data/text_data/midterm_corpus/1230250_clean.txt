Today there are more number of cars on the roads then perhaps the people walking on the roads which clearly means that most of the people own a car.But I firmly believe that in twenty years from now fewer number of cars would be running on the roads.This would directly imply that the traffic conditions would improve in the future.
Governments everywhere are taking effective steps to improve the public transportation system which would mean incorporation of buses, metro services and sky trains in the public transport system.So in times to come, people would prefer to move through public transport as it would be hassle free, time saving and money saving.
In times to come the prices of the fuel like petroleum and diesel are expected to rise up drastically which would mean that only few people would have the capability to afford it.So only very few people would be in a position to travel in their own cars.This would also cause reduction in the number of cars in years to come as most of the people would have to look for alternative options to travel in order to save money.
People today are becoming more aware about the environment damages caused by the harmful gases emitted from vehicles such as cars.So more and more people are opting for options like car pools in case several people have to go to the same place.This means lesser number of cars running on the roads.Also people are preferring public transport for this reason of environment damages.So this awareness about the environment damages would continue to increase manifolds in times to come and hence lesser number of cars would run on the roads in the future.
So the possible conclusion can be that in the present scenario almost every earning individual owns a car due to reasons of comfort and also because cars are considered a status symbol.But in times to come people would prefer other means of transportation rather than moving in their own cars because of the better public transportation system, high fuel prices and environment damages.
