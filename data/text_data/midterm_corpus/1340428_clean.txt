Some say that sticking to one specific subject, you can be specialist of one subject. I, however, think it is much better and efficient to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. If you have many field knowledge, you can just society, find what you really want to do, and apply it to your major.
To begin with, you can do well after getting job, if you have broad knowledge. For example, in my company, which is mechanics company, management is necessary, since without management, the company can't earn money. All of the people in my company is engendering major. However, the trend of my company is good, since I have a experience in businessman and I'm a manager of this company. My knowledge about business saves my company.
Nest, if you know a lot of things, you can find what you really want to do. I was a business major before taking reveal arts. However, I changed my major after taking engendering I took as a minor, since I was fascinated by it. I thought engendering enable us do a lot of thing s like magic. If I'd just learn about business, I couldn't have find how engendering fitted me.
Finally, you can apply your knowledge even though it is not related to your major. In my friend's example, he research in biological center and his major is biology. However his has great knowledge of mathematics and found the important rule in living creatures which is only explain by mathematics. He circulated all things in the world is related each other and that men only extinction of one kind of small creature may threat human's life.
All in all, for these reasons, I think that it much more profitable to have wide view of many academic subjects. It can help you to adjust any situation in society, find what you can really stick to, and apply your major.
