Ok I believe that in the first way is important to know many kind of subjects because as much as you know is the way that you will have the opportunity to chose the best academic area for you and your skill, after that i believe that the best thing that you should have to do is specialize in a specific subject because when you need to get a job is important to have experience in one topic like computer, chemical things etc otherwise you will be like a "seminal DE todo lost moles" that is a Mexican expression that means that you know many things but at the same time is less or not deep that covert sin a know less person.
For example im chemical engender and i want to study my master here in Amsterdam, and in the beginning of my carrier i wanted to study petroleum process but after a wild my mind start to change because in my studies i had a ecology classes and i did not know which of them i really want to studies, [if you don't know about it let me tell your that both are in the same area (chemical engendering) but they have different profile, even they have a core program in the ending is not the same] so, i had had to choice one of them, because in a future when i will start to work again my work will be in one direction and now i do it , i will choice ecology!!
Although the reasons that i write before i have a contrast opinion because for example the people that study archaeology they have to now many things not just the architecture of one place i believe that a good archaeology should have to know about the past of the country that he or she is studies, has to know about the culture, customs, idioms etc, otherwise they will not do a very good discover.
In conclusion i agree with both statements because depends of the topic and the personal taste of the person that want to study something.
