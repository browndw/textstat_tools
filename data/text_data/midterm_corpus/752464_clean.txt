We have here two obviously correct idea. I think that young people gives their communities enough time for these reasons .
Firstly , they spend most time on their home or around it , so the young people be around us almost all over the time but I can say that was in the past.
Nowadays the young people had lot of responsibility such as school for adult or going with their friends to the malls or to visit the other city or to go with their friends aboard to visit other country and know more and more about the biggest world we had live in. I will give reasons to persuade (whom read this) that my thinking is the better and correctly.
One of these reasons is that the young people on the winter if they had a school they come form school which they feel tired and they take rest for awhile then start to doing their home work or projects or study for exams so they did not have enough time to spend with their families.
The second , if the young people had graduate from the school they had feel freedom and they wants to go every where because their parents had prevent them because they feel that the true and by that way they can protect him so he want to discover the world which surround him such as prison , when he got from the jail he be surprising and felt he is dreaming .
The third and the last , that most scientific provide that the young people (both the men and ween) had powerful that they can work 18 hours contracting the old men or whose cross this stage so if set more than one hour ( the young one) he felt board and he automatically live the places , during the old one referring the sitting.
I tell that because I am feeling the same and I hope that reasons had enough and persuading you ,
