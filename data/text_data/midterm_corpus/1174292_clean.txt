As we now that in this world every one want freedom, no one want to be a slave .Because they think that they had born individual .According to this statement i am not agree with the following statement .Because its not a need to go in a group or led by tour guide .The main purpose of tour guide is to lead the team, and show the direction .In the group or with tour guide there are lot of Foundation, like we have to move with group only .we cant move as we like to move any where .we have to follow all the instruction which is given by group leader. Even we like that place or not we have to be stay with them.Lots of problem we can face at the time of revel.If we are going in a group we cant leave that place without permission.So now a days in our society no body what restriction, they want to move free and enjoy any where .Like i am taking a example of college student , if they are going picnic for five days for the permission of college principal.There college principal suggest them better you people go with tour guide, so that in future you need not to be faced any problem.But student were not agree because they want to go without guide or any faculty member .They want only freedom, because then only they can enjoy any where and use there time in a better way. Some time we need a tour guide but not every time, and also we keep in mind that up to a certain limit freedom must be there, if it will excess it will not good for individual.In my opinion the best .Finally i would like to conclude the best way to travel without any tour guide, but we have to manage all the things, in a right manner and in a systematic way.
