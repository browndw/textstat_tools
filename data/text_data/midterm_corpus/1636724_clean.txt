When the issue weather the successful people should try new things and take rises or only doing what they already know how to do well is of great interest to people. In my opinion, I prefer to agree the successful people should try new things and take risks for the following reasons:
The first important reason of my view is people should gain more opportunities both in their life and in the career. Things changed, People changed. We are living in the growing fast world, trying more new things and taking more risks is helpful to find the new chance to get success. For example, At the end of last century, accounting people is considered working with the computer is useless, because it is the new thing for the people who doing in the information technology field and it also have to risk to change the accounting ability. I would say, the accounting people with using computer skills will success the job looking and keeping from who can not use computer in their work.
The second reason of my view is people will get more self- confident through trying new things and take risks. Self- confident is most powerful thing today. Everyone can fail in their life. When we meet the pain, we should never give up to try. Believe it or not, failure is mother of success, You will work the problem out and feel happy so much, Furthermore, you got the experience for the further life.
Beside the trying new things and taking risk, Doing what they already know well also should be considered. It is not easy to do everything well, even if you are familiar with. So doing you best to try new things and taking risks after you can do normally thing well.
From what is mentioned above, I strongly believe and suggest people should keep trying new things and taking risk for the further. More prepare is helpful for your. Who knows what will happen tomorrow.
