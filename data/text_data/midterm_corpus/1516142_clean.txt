I would have to say that I agree with the statement : "Young people enjoy life more than older people do" and here is why:
When you are young ( I would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around, you definitively have less commitments and responsibility( family or work), than when you are old ,( over 35)
You are more of a free spirit. Please allow me to explain my ideas with some examples.
When I mean you have more energy to go arousing , I am talking about vitality and being in shape, it would not be as easy or comfortable to climb a mountain and camp outdoors when you are in your twenties , when your body is tone and strong. Than when your are in your fifties even if you stay in shape, there is always the risk of a heart attack or other conditions that normally appear with age. And things that seemed key before may be uncomfortable or even dangerous now.
As for the commitments and responsibility, I gravitate towards family and work. To me these two are the center of my life. I could not do the things I did in my twenties now that I have a family to support and I am tied with a mortgage and credit card bills. So I guess I would call this the "settled life factor" , which could be pretty tight in both spheres but more manageable when young.
Finally, I belie that when you are young, you are more willing to take risks, go for adventures and take chances as you go. As people mature they some how change their ways, and settle for something secure which I would translate into a calm life, with much of the enjoyment used already or waiting to be "used" during vacation times, maybe once a year. And as I have heard people say:
If I didn't do that when I was young I don't think I could do it now.
