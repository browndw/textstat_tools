I agree with the statement that advertisements deceives the consumers and make products seem more attractive and/or much better than they really are. In fact it is difficult to disagree with this claim since we are living in a world in which, people prefer to live in fantasies. Not only the variety of products, but also the ways that these products are presented to consumers have increased. Thus, the advertisements became one of the most important components of our daily life.
Advertisements are everywhere, and the way they present a product is even more important that the product itself. Companies have understood the importance of advertisements and commercials long time ago and allocated large amounts from budgets to them even when they do not expect significant returns in the short- run. More strikingly, a language that is based on the purpose of promotion have emerged in the last two or three decades in other spheres, like politics. As a consequence of this, we can see the efforts of countries to promote themselves for attracting tourists and investors. Of course, fancy streets and high- rise buildings are referred rather than the scenes of misery and deprivation in these promotions. Even the everyday conversations have been affected by this trend. In order to have a good career, we have to buy some books that will teach us how we can promote ourselves and increase our value in the labor market.
Today we are living in a world in which not only the producers but also the rulers are trying to sell something to us. All these things have become ordinary components of our lives. Nevertheless, there are few who criticizes it since looking at the material is deleterious for our mental well- being. Our reality is constructed by TV and our satisfaction is secured by the the products that we do not need. Advertisements is the interface of this fake life.
