I, being a student for 12 years now, feel able to judge and talk about the scholar system and in my opinion our scholar system concentrates too much on success than on values.
There are a lot of different subjects and classes you are participating as a student and in every class you are writing exams. But often you do not have enough time to study for such an exam and therefore you just learn the most important facts by heart to succeed in the exam. But you forget the facts you learned by heart very quickly and after a few months nothing is left anymore and you take only a minimum of what you have ever learned at school with you. This is not a very good preparation for life because at school you often only learn how to reproduce facts about a topic in a few days.
By practicing ideas in an enjoyable way like in group work or role plays for example you keep the essence and the main continence of a concept in mind. That way you do not have to feel under pressure to learn facts very quickly by heart, you can enjoy learning! And if you enjoy learning you will take more essence with you.
Teaching concepts and ideas may content ideal ways of behavior you could never teach with the help of facts. Students can learn about values and strategies that are important for their future life. If they understand the background or the concept of something they learn they will always be able to reproduce these strategies of behavior in daily situations. And in my opinion this is the task of school.
School should prepare all of the students for their future. It is up to a school to teach values and virtues because very often parents fail. It is sure that values cannot be taught by giving facts or by learning things by heart. Values can only be taught by practicing them and therefore I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
