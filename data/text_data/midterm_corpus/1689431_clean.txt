In my opinion i believe the theory about that in twenty years there will be less cars than there are today is wrong.I thinks that because of the way of human life,in the future will be more cars there are now.
The first point of this theory is that when i look at documents about cars in the past there was just a few cars and very expensive so nobody could buy one. Today every family can buy a car or more than one. The amount of cars in use have exceeded the expectations and now there as cars or more that people in the Earth.
Furthermore, the humans are getting more and more lazy. We plan owe life trying to do as less exercise as we can. So even we go near home we just take the car because it is easier to get and faster. If we think in the obesity progress in society we can assume that people is getting fatter and and lazier, and one reason for that is the use of the car.
Another point for this growing situation is the economic aspect of this industry. Government from all over the world has a big interest in using and selling cars, because of their own economic benefit. As you can see the best cars in world are produced y the economic potentiates like Germany, or the United States, or Italy or Japan. Moreover they have a big interest in the gas they sell because it is a big economic resource in all over the world.
Finally by my point of view the industry is growing more and more,so there is no reasons i can give to think that in twenty years will be less cars than today.So because of the human way of life, in the future will be lots of more cars that it is right now.
