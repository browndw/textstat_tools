Ideas and facts can be thought two different parts of a song. Ideas like the melody of a song and the facts like the lyrics of the song. Both of them are important, however, if we change the lyrics of a song, it seems it still a song and just with different meaning, but if we change the melody of the song, sometimes, it may not be a song or it is already another song. Comparing with these tow different parts, I agree that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
First, I believe ideas and concepts of knowledge is the main core as the most important part during our learn. There are millions and millions facts of each subject, and it is impossible for us if we want to get bench specific aspect of the facts, even though we spend our whole college life to learn them. So the best way of learning knowledge is to get the main idea or concepts in the first step, and then pick up some relative facts to help us understand it and supersize it.
On the other hand, there is no necessary to learn all the facts but we must to get the ideas and concepts, even when we do the extra- activities. In the extra- activities that we organized in college , we usually need to prepare a lot of details things in order to keep it going as we expected. But, there are still more or less new problems emerge during the activities. If we only focus on the facts that we learned or we prepared, we will never ever find the right way to solve it immediately. However, if we have a well- understanding of main idea on this complaint, we will do everything quickly and in the right erection. That is why I think getting the main idea is more important than learning facts.
