I would support this statement. It is logic that advertisements let products look much more innovative fund better as it, in fact, really is. Look, if you were an advertisement creator and know innovations for this product, which should be emphasized, the things, which improve the usage of it, you have to focus on it.Let the commercial look like it's an incredible invention made by the company and this only for the viewer of the ad. It has to be attractive for the consumer, so that he thinks about buying the product.
If there is a advertisement telling me, as a consumer, about the advantages and a lot of other things, I'd not think much about it, because it's only one in a million of new things. But by telling me the outstanding advantages, the product could attract me and so led me to a shop to buy it. To reach this point in the mind of people who see this commercial, you have to emphasize the improvements and even let them appear much better than they are in real. You can also use a comparison between the product, which you are advertising for, and another one. By doing this the other product has to perform very bad, while "your" one acts normal or even unbelieving good. Now letting the bad performance seem as the standard before the new advertised product were invented, creates also an overrated image of the new one.
Doing advertisements in this way is the only opportunity to led people to buy this and not another product. It is even the only way for a commercial to get recognized by the audience.
The way how advertisements are made led to the statement that most of the advertisements produced make products seem much more better than they really are.
