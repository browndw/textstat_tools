Knowledge is nothing but the detailed information. Knowledge of the academic subjects and the knowledge of specialized subject or interest of area. I prefer the broad knowledge on the academic subjects.
Introducing a new subject are very useful to us. In the subject of academic have a basics and some details about the subject. Because of this details are very useful to the human life and future also. For example take mathematics subject, in this we have calculations and divisions, etc. Mathematics subject come up to the under graduation. Mathematics are very use full in calculations of heights of the mountains we are using the integration,it is one of the mathematics topic. Although matches are using in physical department also. Every subject have relation to each other subject. Knowledge is define. Knowing of the new subject is very interesting as well as slightly difficult, because the subject new to the student they can fell little more difficult compare to the other subject. Our mind have a great stability so we can have knowledge of all academic subject means that not going to be difficult.
Although knowledge in the specific subject is not going to help to the future, now a days the new technologies are coming to the world. We should have a knowledge of the academic subjects. In academic they are introducing new technologies and topics which are going to be use full to the student that go King to change rapidly. Take example as a computer. In old day computer is not there. Now a days computers r must and should to the student. The knowledge should be the newly arrived and old also. So the knowledge on specific subject is not best.
How ever the knowledge of the academic subjects r going to be very helpful. By learning a specific topic the broad knowledge of the academic subjects is good.
