A wiz mane wane said " knowing a thing about every thing is better than knowing every thing about one thing " , he said it once and i will hallway will repeat it, i see my self as a successful person in my community because i always try to learn more and more in my life even the unnecessary issue i would like to know even a little about them.
Doing your job successfully is a good thing, but doing more than one subject in a very good way in better and more effective in your life. Here is some benefits of having a several things that you can do correctly :
1- the ability to work in more than one job.
2- you will earn more money.
3- having a mind that is full of ambitions and attendant.
Imagine yourself tween a new grub of friends or withe your friends at work and a very exiting subject has been occurred and the others are talking about it while you don't know what hay are saying !! That's a schema i would not like to be in.
In a higher level, lets say community aspects. In order to have a very bounded and secure community it will be very useful if the stepparents ia this community know how to do more than one thing in there life's.
Even in the sports field it will be better fore your body to experience more than one moment like hiking and swimming one is in the water and the there is in the mounts but both are good and healthy even if its risky in a way or another but risk is the only attribute that makes this life more enjoyable and testable.
People live only one life- as far as i know- stopping yourself from doing any thing in your life in un questionable if you answer this question : How many times you will live ?
