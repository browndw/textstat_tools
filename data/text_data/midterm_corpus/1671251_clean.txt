I agree this statement, because if they do nosy have a risk.,they won't grow herself. If they don't grow herself, they won't success. If you do just what you know now, your skill for everything won't change forever. And to challenge to other thing is to make success.
I think that the successful people took a risk.If they don't take a risk, they don't succeed about everything.
In my case, I took a risk of language. I'm studying abroad in Canada now and go to the high school same as Canadian. That was hard for me. I could not speak English very much and was afraid of speaking to Canadian and using English in front fo Canadian. But I decided myself to come here and study English. I realized again and I became to try to speak to everyone though they are Canadian. Finally, I could make friends and got good relationship between my host family. And to try everything was changed my mind like kindly and more positive.
Second, in my opinion, if somebody don't want to take a res and challenge anything, they won't grow herself. To grow yourself, you must do something for you. I guess that something include some risk. But if you don't grow, you can not be success.Because, your mind is same as before you don't challenge anything.
In japan, i did not take a risk and challenge to anything so i did not grow at all. But I came here i did growled a lot. Because I did challenge a lot and to grow myself. So i got a friends, good relationship and confidence to everything.
Finally, I think to challenge is to make success. If you don't challenge, you don't have anything even gad mark or result. You don't get anything and you don't success.
For these three reason, I agree this statement; Successful people had a risk for challenging.
