The most promising way to sell a product is by advertising it to people. To sell their products, companies often claim false information about them. I totally aggro that most of the products advertised seem much better than what they really are.
The objective of advertising products is to attract people into buying them. Some companies often attract people by selling false information about their products. For example when I am watching television, I see many advertisements of reducing fat pills. The add claims that these pills will reduce your body weight in just two weeks. Obviously this is not true, and I have hear of many people who have bought these pills, that it could seriously affect the heart. Thereby, the producers of this pills attract many customers and only care about making money regardless of what may happen to people.
Marketing companies rely on certain techniques that attract people in order to sell products. Among the techniques used, surveys are conducted to explore people's needs. Thereafter, the advertisements contain information that hooks customers. The problem is that many customers are ignorant and have not learn to differ the real product with the product that they see on adds. As a result, companies can take advantage of this and make their products seem better and suitable for people. For example, salesmen find rural towns a perfect place to sell products. Why is this? The people living in those town are ignorant and can be easel tricked into buying the products.
In conclusion, I aggro that many advertisements make their products look better than they really are. The reason to do so, is to attract people and make more money than what they would make if they told the truth about their products. Unfortunately, marketing companies can easel sell their products to ignorant people who believe them.
