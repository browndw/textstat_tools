Young people enjoy life more than older people do. I agree and disagree with that statement because sometimes you can see an old person is enjoying his\ her life and that depend on his feelings, money, health, and thinking about how he\she is going to spend the rest of her life either in joy or sad.
There are lot of people who enjoy life in different way, i mean that each person has his own and different way to enjoy life.
Sometimes you can see old persons who enjoy life more than a young person and sometimes you can find young persons who enjoy life more than old persons and as i said joyless in life differs in each one and also it depends on the persons feeling, money, health, and his way of thinking.
You can see lot of young people who suffer in life and wish to die, that because of lack of one of the four things i mentioned above, and sometimes you can see lot of young people who enjoy life because they are still young and being old is still far away from there life and that they must spend each second of his life happily and joyfully. Sometimes you can see old persons who suffer in life and that is 70% of them and that because they are afraid from death or they feel that they are too old and cannot handle and do anything and they want other people to take care of them like small children, but still we can find old people who are happy and they enjoy there life lot because its the end of there life and they have to pass every minute happy and that will cause the old persons to live longer.
In my opinion the statement could be both agreed and disagreed as i mentioned above and joyless and happiness can be made by the person him\ her self.
