In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.I agree with the issue stated above.The details and examples listed below states my view on this issue.
Its a known fact that cars accommodate fewer people when compared to brussels and trains. Lets us say for example there are 100 passengers for all these persons in order to accommodate a bus requires 2 brussels in case of a car the number is large say around 25 cars.we have to use fuel in order to run these cars and brussels. Compare the fuel that is wasted when we use 2 brussels and 25 cars the fuel wastage is heavy when we use cars.So that we can save some fuel for future generations.

Another reason is that as more cars are moving there will be more amount of pollution on the earth the pollution in turn effects health of many people. For example some cities in Vitaly celebrate one day in a year as cars day on that day no car will be in the streets the main purpose of this is to celebrate one day with out pollution which clearly state that riding more number of cars will have a devastating effect on the environment and the fuel prices are increasing rapidly it is very difficult for common people to maintain a car so they won't use a car frequently.

The other reason is that in these present days global warming has increased rapidly which means the temperature on the earth surface is increasing rapidly this cause melting in polar ice caps if it happens so many of the parts in this world will be submerged.Of course cars are not only the means that are causing this however if we reduce the usage of cars we can reduce it somehow.So in future government of various countries will took necessary steps to use fewer cars.
In conclusion cars are not only the only means for transportation but there are some other means of transport which can be used by the public in effective ways so fuel can be saved for the future generations.Hence after twenty years fewer cars will rum on the road.
