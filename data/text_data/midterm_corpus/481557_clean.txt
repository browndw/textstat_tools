Travel agency suggest their service traveling in a group led by a tour guide. And man people use this service for their safety and guide's professionalize. But one of university student, I disagree with a group travel along tour guide there are two reason why I prefer travel by my self: opportunity for learning other nation and saving my money.
Fort of all, traveling a group with tour guide remove my opportunity for learning other nation's culture. I had a chance to trip in Vietnam about two years ago. There was guide for our group. Most of our group did not concentrate guide's explain and he did not care about it. And I needed to keep our group so I do not have proffer time to enjoy seminary and food. I went around at night with buying some beer and snack. It is more exciting and memorable. If I did not go out along and do noting the travel was just waste of a few days.
Second guide fee is expensive. I do not have enough money and there si many way to prepare travel plan, reservation for hotel and search for air plane schedule by using phone, travel book and internet. When I was in savoy for visiting my cousin. I traveled a lot of place in U.S.A. I usually saw the travel guide book in the university library near my cousin' house or searched the net. So I did not spend unnecessary cost such as guide fee.
In conclusion, I would like to travel without a your guide and along. I want to prepare my travel schedule bv myself and save my money not spend guide fee. Traveling is one's opportunity for boarding their knowledge and experience. Making their plans and behaviorism more activities will help their exciting travel.
