For centuries people have been developing ways to help other people. Nowadays society is concerned about helping people and every day is more common to find places where people can do some kind of social work, for example: charities shop, hospital and even there is some kind of community police. Young people have always been treated like a problem, because teenager delinquency is every day more popular. Some young people is worried about environmental issues and some of them are worried about their communities. However, a vast majority of young people do not concern about anything related with their own community, they show more interest in topics like environment, employ rates and animal rights.
Governments around the world are trying to find the way of doing that young people become in a dynamic part of the community. If they are involved in the community development they will not have any time to waste. Bordon could not be a reason for delinquency. Furthermore young people can improve their conditions and the community's conditions. Everybody win weather everybody work together.
As a young person I am spending some time helping old people. They need our help and if we can give them some help why do not do it? In fact I belie that almost all of our problems are because people and young people do not want to do anything good for their community, they just want to spend all day doing nothing and this behavior makes unproductive people. Delinquency rates and crime are slightly related with this problem.
On the other hand young people do not realizes that they some day will be old people, some day they will have their own children and they have to start to change the history if they want to live in a better place.
Finally I think that the stamen is true and nobody want to spend their time doing good things for th community. It is a real problem and if we do not find a good solution every day could be worst. Young people should be more conscious of this situation.
