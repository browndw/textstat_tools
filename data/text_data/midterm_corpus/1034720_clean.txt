No i do not entirely agree on the statement that group travel led by a tour guide is the best way to travel due to numerous reasons.
I have gone to many countries both in a group with my parents and alone, in my experience the best time i had was with a group of teenagers my age in Ursa because we were all the same age and of different backgrounds, but it was' entirely like a vacation where you had your piece of mind, and complete freedom to they ways you wanted to enjoy your time. Rather than waking up at 6 in the morning and going according to set guidelines made by the tour guide i would chose to roam the place alone, discovering numerous places on my own and taking the vacation as an adventure.
Al tough moving in a group can be fun, but i belie going with a small group of maybe about 2 or 3 friends that think alike is a better option.
And even though going with a huge group is amazing fun, the tour guide is what spoils all the fun. Tour guides usually have the whole vacation planned out with set timing making the holiday seem like another school day where you have a worked up schedule to follow.
Therefore in my onion the best way to travel would defiantly be in a group but without a tour guide, because then you get the freedom to do you want and the liberty to make you own divisions rather than following a tour guide. But if the tour guide is another person similar to the group your traveling in and knows the place well the tour could definitely be the best ones. But going to the mislays for adventure with a tour guide would definitely kill the adventurous feeling that could be achieved by going alone.
Therefore the statement has its pros and cons depending on your tour guide, the group and the situation. But if all the three are perfect then the statement is definitely justified.
