It seems strange but also before this text i was speaking about this problem with some of my friends.
In particular we discussed about the case of Milan a very famous city , that is located near were I live. This city has a lot of problems and one of them is the traffic caused by cars. Imaging that this city has normally one million of inhabitants, but everyday more then one million and half people, arrive at the city for their job, and most of them driving their cars.
During the last century a lot off changes happened, if we consider that car or better the motor was discovered at the end of the 19th century.The reason of this problem could be found at the middle of the 20th century were the possibility to have a car were a status symbol.
I can not affirm if in twenty years there will be fewer cars then there are today, but i am sure that it is necessary to do something to change this situation, not only for the quantity of traffic but for the consequences that this pollution has on our environment.
The very big problem especially in Italy, is caused by the terrible conditions of our national system of transportation , i am speaking about old and often dirty trains, Pullmans..that do not cover the real necessity of the people.
I think that this is the right way that the institutions and the government as to follow , because without investment nothing could be change.
We should study alternative system of transport increasing the use of modern and faster machine as the magnetic train already in use in Germany and China, or we just have to give a look to the past as some country done , reintroducing the use of operatic and.. Bicycle.
