This question is a really complied question. I am a student i agree that for me is most important to understand the subject that about just know the fact. In history if you understand the idea you have the fact but if you know the fact you maybe not understand the idea. For the student is most interesting to disease with the teacher that just read a book. The important in a class is make the student happy. If the student has good mark in the class he probably liked the class. But if the student has bad mark he maybe liked the class too. I mean that the student can like a classroom if he has good mark but can like a class where he has ad mark. The teacher can help in this way.
If the teacher just take the book and say" read page 234 in ten minutes a quiz." The student probably don't like the class. If the teacher say" ok who want discuss the subject with me today after i make a quiz about we disease" the student listening heat teacher says and understand the subject faster that if he just read the book and don't say anything and actually sleep on is book. I remember a student who has so much troubles in history in my grad ten year history. In grad eleven class history we change teacher and the teacher decide to use disease and try to explain the subject with example. This student has is mark improve so much. An today long time after this history class i remember pretty well my history class. And my opinions change so much about history. For the student learn we need interest the student and making feeling happy in all of is class. If this system is working why we are not tried in every class.
