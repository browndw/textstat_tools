Let me tell you somethings about successful people who most of them are rich. But we have the wrong idea about them because we think that they are looking for poor people from up to down while most of them are just ordinary people. They do the same things that we do they eat in normal restraints, wear normal clothes, drive an middle class car, that what I had seen two weeks ago in the T.V with professor ilium who said that "presumption deferment from reality". Some people asked do successful people try new things?or they taking the risks rather than drowning drowning things normally?
The lief that successful people are what we think that they are not moist and use poor people for their benefits without thinking about their life or their family really most of time is wrong as I mentioned in the first paragraph about "wrong prescription". Also, most of those people think that successful people do not take the risks or do the things in different way. While, successful people said that they are like to take the risks to make their life so exciting and give it the slaver of dangerous which what they say keeps them work for the best. Mo rover, they said that they always likes drowning things in different way so that they discover new tinges even if it is effected on their life carrier by making their life upside down. However, some of them prefer to do not take the risks and walk on a lighted way rather than dark way that maybe they would face plumbers in their way destroy them or sent them to emergency .
Allover, there are different kind of successful people in their thinking. One of them who chose the easy way and others who chose the dark way because it excited them. Well, my opinion is that life without dark way have no excited places but who chose way have to know the keys of it not waiting for the next pump.
