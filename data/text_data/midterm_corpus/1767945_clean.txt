" Each finger is different from the other", a say by a well known pot.
I wouldn't disagree and give u a fact that I'm sure is not right, and defending people from my own age by saying that they do help their communities.
But though, they're lot of children that are participating and helping communities, even though lots are not but those kids that are should be hounded because what they're doing is not a small thin g at all. Helping others in their age, with lots of pressure is not an easy thing that they can handle, that why lots of parents do not allow their children in applying for activities or communities.
Parents are conserved about the level of they're children in studies, and that one of the main reasons, why kids do not consider peoples problems and try to help, its because they are not thought to love each other at home, they are not thought to love doing nice thins for others and help the neediest although most OD the religion around ofthe world consists on helping the person that does not have enough to care of him self, whether it was something in the person or it is a need of money,.
Helping communities start with small things around us, and I'm that they are lot of kids that are helping by small things that they don't even bother to count because they might think its silly.
In conclusion I don't fully agree with the statement but wish from parents and people whom call their self adults to make our younger children and next generations of kids to be considered and loving to others and to know that there no difference between a wealthy and a poor or a white or black except by heart because as we grow our heart splits around our beauty in our face and moves.
