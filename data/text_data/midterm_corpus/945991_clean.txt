If we take a look around the world, we will realize that the most successful people have always been at the edge of technology and have accomplish their goals by taking risks and trying out new things. It is necessary just to read any successful man's biography to understand what this means.
We all need to learn how to do things the best way we can and I think sometimes it can be quite scary to go into an unknown field, because there is a big chance we might fail. But failure is always a possibility and is present through our whole life and we have to learn to deal with it, because if we all stick to what we do and don't try out new things, then the world would stop growing and developing and we would be immerse in a place where there is no innovation.
For instance, in business, the best way to be successful is to come out with some product that nobody else has, that makes you unique. But most of the time, there is a big chance people won't like it. That's why even if you do marketing studies, there's always a risk factor that involves making decision based on what you believe in without knowing the results. And in spite of how difficult it looks, it is necessary to keep going and make it happen, just to see how it turns out to be.
In conclusion, the key to success is to innovate and take risks, this is the only way we will be able to build a better world, not only getting money, but also helping society, because in my opinion, success is not only defined by how rich you are, but by how much you have done for the world we live in.
