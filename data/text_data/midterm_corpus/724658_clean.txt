I totally agree with the opinion, young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are several reasons, they spend too much time on their jobs, they are not familiar with the people in their communities and unwilling to try to know them, and they prefer to use their own time for other pleasures.
In the technology generation, people spend more time on their jobs because they are competitive. They have to work very hard to keep their jobs. They have to spend a lot of time to make the achievements. They have to work as long as possible to show their loyalty to their boss. That cause the average time in office increased and no time is left for the communities.
Besides, the modern society becomes more conservative than before because of the increasing crimes. People don't say hello to the strangers. They treat the strangers with a suspicious manner. That makes people unwilling to get involved in the community services. I ever heard that someone had tried to raise a fund for the community services but the door was shut heavily because he was thought to be a cheater.
Also, in the city, there are many attractive pleasures, such Karo-Loki, pubs, dancing clubs.., people prefer to use their leisure time to go to those places in stead of helping their communities. They think helping the communities is government's job and they has paid the tax, someone else should do this job, but not themselves.
Even though there are still someones willing to spend their time to helping their communities, from these points of views above, I think that is only of small percentage. Most people are still selfish, they would rather to spend time on their own jobs, pleasures, and keep themselves from the community services.
