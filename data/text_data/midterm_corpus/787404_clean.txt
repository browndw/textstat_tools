I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities. To be more clear, by young people i would mean people in the age group of 20-35 yrs.
As times are changing, people are getting more and more involved with themselves, and the materialistic pleasures of life. This is especially true of the young generation, who value money more than anything. As a result, most of the attention of our youth is on earning money, and hence they are busy fulfilling their aim. Today's world is very competitive and in this struggle, young people often do not find the time to contribute to their community.
Another reason for such a thing, is that communities are no longer close knit as they used to be. There is a lesser feeling of belonging to some particular community, and there is the emergence of a global community. More and more people travel to various places, and hence it is difficult for them to associate with a particular community.
Reasons apart lets state some examples from our experiences. One such example is the lack of participation of youth in voluntary organization, such as those for educating the poor people. It might be true that young people contribute money in such schemes, but we don't see too many young people, actually going out there and teaching. Another example is the absence of young leaders in our government. Young people do not find such a career very financially rewarding and hence abstain from actively participating in the functioning of a government.
So as time is progressing, young people are getting motivated to work more for themselves, than for their communities. I would not say that this is true for all young people, but it would hold true in most cases. Such a drift away from community responsibility is primarily motivated by the current lifestyle of the younger generation.
