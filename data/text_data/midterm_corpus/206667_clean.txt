Here the statement is correct,so i agree with it as the present days does not have enough time to think for oneself, how he help the community? So he was not helping the communities.
First look for the past days, there man has less information to know, less luxuries, less work. There life can be lead comfortably with less money .that is why people involve in the community part, especially students or young one, because life span is short.
Then look for th present days here the information to know is vast, so no time to deviate. Now th world is in the hands of th people i.e every thing is available. As the human desire is vast.so he ends up in a wild goods change of things. No self satisfaction,so noontime to look for the others.so he never bother about the surrounding world.
Second thing is the excessive growth of population. Each city is having the lacks of people, it may vary depend on the type of city is it metropolitan or capital city. Depend on it the community sig varies. For the such large population. There are many problems and public can't solve it as it requires more money. Although collective impact may help,it is a difficult process. As every body looks for the govt help rather than helping the society is the main route cause for the less involvement in the community work. Shortly it is the increase in the population and work schedules of students leading to decrease in the involve of community work.
Then i can concluded that, the main reason that is inferring is increase of burden on the every student leading to this. Then there is need for the govt to look after this.as the student must involve in every thing it is the govt must easy every thing.
