Young people have future. I agree this statement. Now I am a person who is thought young people. I enjoy my life now. May be I will have some problems in the future. These troubles will cause difficult that I can enjoy the life. Now a days many older people have these problems. On the other hand, young people have a long future. Most of them will live longer than older people, so they can plan many things what they are going to do in the future. This is also means that If they have a trouble, they have enough time to solve it. For example health problem and finance problem.
At first, usually young people are health than older people. Health problem is serious and it avoid happy life. In my experience, my grandmother always suffer from her disease. Because of this disease, it is hard for her to walk around her house. She can not go to shop to buy food. Unfortunately, recently sometimes she can not go to toilet on her own ability. She always says that she wish, she can go back her young days. Many Japanese old people say that how your health is when they met some old person.
The second, older people can not work, so they have to consider about their finance. They have to manage the money. It is stress for them. However young people can work well, because they are fine. They do not have to care about it. Also It is easy for them totem to rend money.
In conclusion, I do not have a serious problem that she older people have now, but I will have soon. What should do is not only enjoying this life but also prepare for the future. Therefore, I suppose this statement is true.
