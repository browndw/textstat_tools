I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Now I am working for a Japanese company in Japan and usually the holiday I can take is really shorter than other countries. To travel efficiently, traveling in group with a guide is the best way. I don't need to spend many time to find a restaurant and to worry about the losing way. And the other good point is that traveling in a group, I can meet many people who I can share the atmosphere of the places. I will explain more details as follows.
The first reason is that traveling in group with a tour guide help me to travel efficiently. As I mentioned before, I cannot take a long holiday as a usual Japanese company. Therefore, I don't have enough time to stay the same place. To visit many places in the short term, I need a guide to help me to go around. In addition, I don't so worry about emergency situations such as losing ways, traffic jams, and train delays because a tour guide usually know how to handle the situation.
The second reason is that I can share the impression of the trip with group members and exchange our opinions. Even though traveling alone can make more free time, I would like to share the atmosphere of the places with others. For example. I will go to a restaurant during the trip. If I eat alone, I cannot enjoy the meal. I will miss someone who can talk to me.
Consequently, I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I can travel many places during my short holiday if a guide lead me. Moreover, I can share how I feel in the place with other people.
