Are young people nowadays not giving enough time to helping their communities? I disagree with this statement because i think many young people give enough time to helping their communities.
First of all, while you attend a school, the school requires a certain amount of time of helping your communities. Moreover, almost every university requires those time when you apply for the university, so you have to help your communities if you want to enter the university whether you wish to help your community or not. Some of the young people may think that they are forced to do this, but it doesn't change the fact that young people are doing the community activities.
Secondly, there are many clubs which are organized to serve for the communities in universities. These clubs are made with the students' freewill, not against their will. For example, I am an university student and currently I am a member of a club mainly help the orphans and serve in orphanages.
Thirdly, older people usually have more family members to feed than young people, so young people have more finical, mental, physical energy and time to help the communities. My father, for example, used to go to a volunteers' club to serve in a certain place that needs people's help like a place for the disabled before he got married, but after he got married and gave a birth to me, he doesn't have enough time and energy as much as he used to have, so the frequency of his visits to a club has decreased and he doesn't go there any more now, even though he wants to help.
Finally, young people are more open- minded so they are willing to help the others than old people. Because the fact that you are young means that you have a flexible mind so that you can understand the circumstances that others are facing very well. This will make you easier to help your community.
For those reasons, I think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities unlike the statement.
