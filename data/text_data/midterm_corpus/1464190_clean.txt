I agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for several reasons such as , to discover new places , to feel safe and get good prices.
First , in any where or place need to be with someone who knows the place where you want to go because he can take you to places as you wish. For example , last summer i went to japan by myself. So, at that ti me there was a friend who knows me. After ward , he took me to many beautiful places in Tokyo. So if i was alone i wouldn't feel enjoy. That person was really a good tour guide .
Second, in any country even in USA which is one of the safest countries around the world , you will feel unsafe if there is no person can tell me which places should i go or not , which time should you go outside or not to go. Meanwhile when you have a tour guide , that means you are safer especially if he from the area which you will go that will be better. As a result , he is going to be your security because the people will know that you have a citizen who works as a guide .
Last point, is getting good prices and that is true. For instance, in Africa specifically in Egypt , if you have a taxi's friend , that means you are strong person. Moreover , nobody will sell you by high prices or take much money from you without doubt. Other ways if you are alone there almost all the theirs and sellers will take money from you without any right .
In conclusion , if you don't want to think a lot and you want have fun , to feel safety and to be smart by the dealing with the people , just travel with a tour guide .
