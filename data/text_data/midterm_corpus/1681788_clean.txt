I do not agree with the statement. In order to explain this opinion, I will first summarize positive and negative aspects of each life stage, and then draw a conclusion from this evidence.
Young people have several opportunities in their current life stage. The have health and the vigor that characterizes youths. They also have access to opportunities in almost every aspect of life: academics, profession, family, spirituality, etc. They also have support from family members, friends, and colleagues.
Even though youths have these advantages, they have important threats to their possibilities of enjoying life. Youths worry about their future, planning their career, their family, their jobs, etc. They are also immature to appreciate the special gifs of life, and because of their opportunities, take life for granted. Finally, they learn through experience, and sometimes these experiences are painful and have terrible consequences.
The elderly, on the other hand, are mature, with a broad baggage of lived experiences. They can enjoy the fruit of their work and the result of their decisions. Since they do not have much more to live, they do not take life for granted, and try to enjoy life as much as possible.
Although the elderly have other threats such as sicknesses, deaths in their families and worries of when they are going to die themselves, they have the awareness that their life is short, and they will try to make the most of it.
When comparing the youths' opportunities and threats to those of the elderly, we can easily find that the advantages of the elderly, in terms of possibilities of enjoying life, are greater.
In summary, young people worry about their future and do not have the time to enjoy their present, whereas the elderly enjoy their present and accept their future.
