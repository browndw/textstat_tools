I think that the car has changed the life of the last century and it is an important mean for our life still today.
However I think also that the cars bring with them same ambient and social problem.
First of all, the cars make too pollution, also new cars that they have so many restriction but again today is not enough.
Furthermore, the cars have destroyed all kind of human relationship whit nature and other elf. For example, for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meters, because, so they do less work. The people don't want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lassie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problems of moving.
This abuse of the car is allowed because not only for the laze of the people but also for the bad condition of public transport.Indeed, in some part of the world, it is always late, duty, and sometimes very expensive, and above all comfortless. In other words, these are situations that force people to take the car. Indeed, it has all confront that we want: air conditioned, music, space...
I don't belie that among twenty years the car will be fewer, instead I think that the number will grow up more and more.
This will be possible because a wrong political way hes been gotten ( I am talking about my particular country situation) .Nothing is doing to change direction.
On the other hand, somebody thinks that the end of petrol will decrease the number of car, but for my it is not true, for to topic: the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the cars' factory never will alle the the car will lose importance in our life.
In conclusion I think that the solution are two or the government of all work.
