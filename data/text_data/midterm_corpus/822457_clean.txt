Of course i completely support the idea that most advertisements make products seem much much better than they really are.
Let me talk about an experience of myself,i have followed the advertisements many time in making decisions and after that i found that i was mistaking.
For examples, i watched on the television about a new kitchen tools which was very nice and very cheap.In that time particular i was preparing my apartment and i was looking for such things.
In the first i thought it was very nice but after buying it i found it was a big mistake to buy it because it spent one one week and after that it completely destructed.
Another thing which happen to me while i was looking for a insurance company for my new car, i red an announcement about a new insurance company, that advertisements was like a dream,it said that if any small thing happened to your car it will be fixed totally free, and if the car is completely destructed, you will have a new car, when i red it i decided that i will join this company to insure on my car, after one year of joining that company and paying all my money,i made an accident with my car, and when i went to the insurance company,i was astonished to hear that i would not get any money because i was mistaken.
Another one more thing, when i was look for a nice place to spend my honey mol there with my new wife i heard about a new tourism company.I went to it and i asked them for a nice place to go and they advised me to go for a certain place.But when i went there i found that every thing is very bad.
So that i think that one should not follow the advertisements when shearing for any thing because many companies try to sell its bad products by making a very incorrect advertisements and they pay tremendous amount of money in it and spend lot of money to make it looks like what we see.
