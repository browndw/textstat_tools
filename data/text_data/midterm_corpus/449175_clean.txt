"It is the idea that creates one's interest in learning things conceptually and this eventually leads him know the facts related to the idea"
As far as my opinion is concerned i agree with the statement "It is important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn the facts" because unless i get an idea i will not know how to start with.
Once i get an idea i will try learning, learning needs the conceptual base for the skilled building.As soon as i start learning and i acquire concept i will try getting back to the history of that particular idea will will get me across the facts related to it.On the contrary if i learn facts this will not helps me to be more creative.
For example, as a doctor if i have an idea of research in neuron and glacial cells in brain i will first study the whole stuff related to the neurons , the glacial cells and the things related to these two things. After understanding the concept of the research and having a clear idea i can get along with the research.During the research i will come across the facts regarding the neurons and the glacial cells.On the other hand if i start with the facts my knowledge will be limited to an extent and i will not try learning more about it as i will be convinced by the the tag it has got that is "FACT".Once i know it is fact i will not try learning about it.
Thus i feel it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts. This will make them more innovative and provides them with a wide scope of learning the subject. When one understands the idea and concept definitely he will come across the facts related to the subject. To conclude "Ideas and concepts include facts, but not the vice versa"
