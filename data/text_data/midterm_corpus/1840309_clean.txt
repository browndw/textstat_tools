I agree with this statement. I also think, that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is to learn just facts. I can say that especially in connection to my own majors mathematics and economics. For the future life it is very important, that you understood ideas and concepts at school and university.
My first major Mathematics is probably the best example for this statement. Just by listening to the professor and reading books you will learn nothing about mathematics. My professor always says that we have to work on exercises ourselves because the most important thing is to understand the concepts behind the thinks we learned. Without understanding the concepts, we wont be able to understand the further lectures. So it is very important, even for for little kids and school. If they don't understand the ideas in the first classes, they will never understand them.
Another good example is my second major, economics. In the university we just look on easy topics. The goal is not to know how to work with these topics, but to understand the ideas behind it to use these ideas to solve more complex things in the future life at a big company for example. That is where I come to my third very important point, why understanding ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts.
In the future life, especially at work, you will probably never be asked again about special facts, that you learn at the university. If you are, it will be easy for you, to go on the internet and find out these facts. Today the internet is so complex, that everyone will find almost every information he wants to get. There is no need to know historical dates or something like this as long as you have the ability to use a computer.
So I think, these are very clear points. In my opinion, schools and universities should even more focus on teaching the students the ideas and concepts behind a topic and not make them learn facts.
