I support that there will not be fewer cars in the future twenty years comparing to these days. The reason that day to day life is changing depending on the cost of living and the easy way to move from one place to another with more safety.Since the technology is being advanced in all the fields, people prefer the different technology cars in the up coming days.
As we know that there are lot of accidents on two wheels. These cars provide the safest way to reach the long distances in shorter time and safe. Some countries like India, Japan, China etc still people prefer the easiest way to reach by walk is using a bike or motor cycle but fastest way other than bike is car and its safe too. I too say that the day to day life the resources of petrol and diesel have been hiked since the quantity is low, nut in the future the technology brings the different way to use the cars without fuel and exiting resources.
For example comparing to the companies like Mercedes, general motors, ford, Rhonda etc., the researchers are doing they research on different fields to develop they company in different ways like safe driving, with low fuel consumption, sleek designs in interiors and exterior, the technology used from one car to another in there own products. Some research oriented companies do there projects on automobiles that use less fuel, some on without fuels and some on driving without a driver with the help of GPS( Global positioning system), and in engines too. These research help the company to move it to built new product in market. These technologies make the consumer attract in buying a new car and hence increases the rate of use the safest car to move from one place to another, this way the usage of car may lead to increase more cars in the future twenty years.
So i think so in future definitely the usage of cars will increase with different technology than compared to these days depending on the way there use them.
