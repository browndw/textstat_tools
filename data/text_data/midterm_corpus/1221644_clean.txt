It is important to have an idea of many academic subjects, but i think it is more important to specialize in one specific subject, that you can collect a lot of information about this subject, and you become more efficient in your work , that you can discover new knowledge about this subject and new field in it, so you can get a good possession in your work and in your life, and you become specialist in you field .
That person who have knowledge of many academic subjects will not collect all the information about the subjects , and he will not become a qualification person to work in specific job and to use his knowledge in this job, comparing to that person who have specialize in one subject.
We can think also that the person who have specializing in one subject should have some knowledge about some subjects , cause he may use them in his life and his job, and he will be more qualification in any field , at the same time when we think about that person who have knowledge of many academic subject he can got any job he want, and it will give him more opportunity in life , that the person who is specialized in one specific subject may not have a lot of operation to have good job especially if he has a specialize in a field which is not popular or an old subject , so he will lose the operation to have job , or to work in his field .
