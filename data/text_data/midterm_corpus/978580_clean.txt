I totally agree with this statement, i think it is much more important to understand an idea than to learn facts.
When a student understands a concept,it means that is very clear in his mind and that he could explain it in a different way or relate it with another subject.Moreover, when someone understands an idea, he learns the facts much easier because they are logically related to this idea.For example, in a history class, if i try to learn some important dates without understanding the course, i will have difficulties and i will forget them a couple of days later.If i understand the course,i will learn those same facts easier because they are all logically connected so i will be able to remember those dates a long time after.
It is more important for students to understand the idea of a particular topic than to learn specific dates because once you understand a course, you do not forget it easily.That is why students should try to understand what the course is about before learning facts.There is no use to learn facts without being able to explain it.
When i was in high- school, i used to hate mathematics because it was for me just learning formulas and writing them downtown the exam day.So when i had a test, i could give the formula but i did not know when, where and how to use it.My teacher noticed that i was learning my formulas in a "silly" way, like a machine as he said, and he told me to spend much more time at home trying to find out how does that work.That is what i did and from that day, i stopped to learn facts that i couldn't understand in all the other courses.Now i always try to understand first which is much more exciting and it takes less time and less pain.
