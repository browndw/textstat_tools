Thinking that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is difficult to believe. With the economical situation in the world, with developing countries like China or India, the number of cars will soon grows up.
Like I've said, all the developing countries need communication ways if they want to have a place in this world, and the car is the first key of success. With communication exchanges are created, and the best support of exchange is the car. In our developed countries, the statistics prove that more and more people use their car for short trips. Nowadays, the high price of oil pushes the people to use less car, but in the future, new energy sources will be invented.
The car has become a part of the occidental way of living, and it will be very difficult to change the facts. Car is also a sign of independence: the freedom to go where and when we want to. Most of European cities are built to get used by car, even if public transports exist. In a kind of way, the car is a part of the occidental culture, and the same situation can be remarked in some other continent. The car is also considered, in many countries, as a symbol of richness - and it's a really important social phenomenon-. This selfish way of thinking shows very well the occidental psychology.
Maybe in the future -less than twenty years-, the number of cars will be fewer in some countries. Those one, aware of the political, social and environmental problem that oil creates, will take their responsibility and act in a positive way. It's also permitted to dream for a better future.
