Nowadays, more and more people like traveling, may be I think the reason why is that those who live in the big city will always feel so busy and noisy,so so traveling becomes a part of their lives, but traveling has many ways to reach your requirement, some people like traveling with a guide in a group, and others are not, although the.
More people you travel with , the happier you will be,I think, but, I like traveling with myself.
First,if I travel by myself, there is nothing to limited me, I can go anywhere whatever I want,I mean I can get rid of those sound from the guild and noisy people, for example, If I want to go hoping, but the guild is calling you, so I think I have no mood to buy or to see, on the other hand, you will feel so bad noisy form those people in your group when you buying things, all of these will destroy your mood.
Secondly,If I travel by myself, I can assign the time instead the guild do,such as going to the hotel, when should I get up next morning and so on,for example, If I watch a football game tonight, so I think I can't get up early next morning, I have alternative choice, or If I eating things, I can relax myself to enjoy it, but If you travel with a group, you must follow the time which arranged by the guide, so I think there is no freedom for me to do everything.
Third, I think every one like to do something which they want to do, so travel by oneself is a good choice for these people, and they can get relax, freedom, and get rid of noisy form big city,so I prefer to travel by myself.
