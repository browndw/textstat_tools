The company in the world build a lot of product, but not all of these product need the people. So the company spend a lot of money in TV spot or marketing in newspaper. They want that the consent thinks that they spend the best product and the consent has to buy the product. The question is when the companies spend more money in marketing, sell they more. And if yes spend they so much more that the cost for marketing are in the value. Red Bull spend half of their money in marketing, they have two teams in the formula one, one football club in Austria, one air craft world series, ... But is that to much money. Cannot they spend the money in better products or gave the money to theirs workers, shareholders, in social projects,... Another example is bay, bay spend a lot of money to tell the people that you can be happy if you sell your thinks which in your house or in your flat. You tell 3, 2, 1, my. But are you happy or is it better if bay do not spend such a lot of money in marketing. When they spend the money a better product, lower cost for the customers. Or if they spend the money in environment. Advertisements should tell us that we buy the best product, but in real we do not buy a product which is better than the product which stand next to them. We hab to pay for the marketing, product from big companies are more expansive than products from no name firms. The people feel better if they buy a product from big company, because they know that they get a good product. When they buy a product from a no name firm they do not know if the product is quit good.
