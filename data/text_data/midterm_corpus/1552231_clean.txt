In my opinion I think that the old people enjoy their life than the young people. There are many examples to show that.
Some of the young people in this world have taking drugs or smokes. These two things do a lot of damage in the body, if you take a lot of drugs or smokes you may die. Some of the young people may go to die because they broke up with their girlfriend or boyfriend, I think that it is selfish. There are many thieves are young people too. Do you think that a person who enjoy or like their life will do these kind of things?
On the other hand I know many older people who study. I saw a lot of older people study in night school. One day i had asked old man why he study in the night school? He replied me that he didn't student good when he was young and he feel very bad about that. He also said that he want to know as much things as he can. I know a lot of older people who are leaning to use computer. I think that the old people are much more hard working than the young. Many student in my high school is sleeping, chatting, or playing games during the lessons. Most of them are waiting the bell ring they don't know how important about student. The older people had lived in the world for a long time, they know that knowledge is so important. They enjoy the process of learning. I know Many older people know that drugs and smokes are not good so they stop it too.
I think that the older people enjoy the life than young people. They do a lot of good things that the young will not do.
