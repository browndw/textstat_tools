Yes i'm agree it ,
I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Nowadays students very clearly, they can use their think do every things, if they have more interest in something, they will do it all time. As a student not just learn some information and knowledge form class and teacher, more and more people think use their think about something more useful just learn some information from class.
With world was development, more and more company want to own high skill people, but people have high skill not just learn from class, you must think about everything use your brain, if you think about some ideas, it's was yours. Not other people, although your ideas was not very true, it was yours, it means you make your brain, and think about something, you understand these ideas and concepts then you can think about again, you can use your option,
Some of country, they teach student some knowledge, they just teach then these, they never let student why you chose this , then student also don't ask teacher why , i think it was not your knowledge, you couldn't remember it , because you not understand it , you just read it, it was very bad for your study.
Now, most of school was suggestion teacher how to teach student, i think when you learn some information you must understand these meanings, it was basic, because only you have understand these meaning, then you can use you own ideas to explain it, it was a good behavior, if you always to do it , then you have a good behavior, it was very useful for you, if you have some troubles, you not roomy about it , you will face to it, because you know you can use your brain to do it.
So i think student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Everybody must learn it, it was very useful for you.
