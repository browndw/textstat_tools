Generally speaking a successful person is someone who succeed in all his attempts, is good in his job and earns a lot of mayonnaise. And all of this aspects are often seen in the area of a job. So a successful person must have a good job and has to do his job as no one else, what can lead us to say that he tries new things and takes risks rather than only doing what he already knows how to do well.
To my mind, it's right that to be successful somebody must have some nerves to apply some theories or to launch a new product on the market. I think that without any qualities so as to stay undisturbed or the ability to foresee what will have some success, we can't have any success. The two qualities, denounced in the subject, are also not enough. Sometimes these successful people take risks, just because these risks exist, they don't care about there success, but they like the game that it implies; it's not a question of doing well or not.
But I must say that there are other people, who one day also try new things with nerves and good ideas, but were unsuccessful. So the fact to try new things and to take risks is not an insurance that our project will succeed. There is a part of luck that we can't forget. We can say that successful people are kind of lucky people. And to be carefully is not so bad, I think ; because to do well is not something that anybody can do. It requires qualities, which are not the same as to try something new, and it can appear as more difficult to do well as to be an venture.
I can't forget to say that there is a third class of people, those who do well, who analyses the situation and take advantage of it and so are successful. And we can take example on these one, because they are a good melt of a reasonable mind and of an venture spirit.
