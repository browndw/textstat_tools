As we finish high school, we start having an idea about what path we would like to take for the rest of our life, so as we begin to attend college we have a, more or less, detailed idea of what it will be our field of study for the following years.
I personally disagree with the statement, because I believe that we need to specialize in a particular field.
What I mean is that, as soon as we have a clear idea of what our major is, there are several reasons to specialize in one subject.
For examples classes from our major make us more competitive in our field, because we gain knowledge on what it will be our future work environment, and at the same time it will make us more prepared to face problems during our career.
At the same time in a constantly changing world, the more our knowledge goes deep in a field, the more we will fit higher level job positions, or the more competitive we will be in the application for Graduate school.
I am a Materials Science and Engineering major student. What distinguishes myself from the other students of my major are the elective classes that I took on specific topics, regarding nano- materials. Taking high grades in this classes enhances my curriculum and makes me more eligible for scholarship for the next years. At the same time a company interested on developing a nano- material technology would be more willing to assume me than another Materials Science and Eng. Student with another kind of background.
At the same time from a non- scientific point of view, I have to say that I lack preparation on humanities knowledge, and I do not feel comfortable when other friends of mine speak about art, history or literature, and if I could I would go back at college to take a couple elective classes from history of art major.
