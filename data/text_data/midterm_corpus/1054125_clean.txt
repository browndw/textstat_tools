First, I think that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects, because you tend to improve your critical mind more than when your are specialized, but in an other hand I think that a specialization may be benefice in some cases too.
In one hand, I think that a general knowledge of many subject increase the ability of a person to understand the society and the world in its many forms.
Indeed, when you know the origin of a phenomenon that medias are talking about, you understand it better: in its construction, and in its effects.
Because most of the time, a phenomenon or crisis, is based on and has developed from a cause that is important to know to really understand the problem.
For instance, when you have both studied geography and history at school, you are more able to understand the origin of political problem such as mass immigration than when you only have studied geography or history.
Indeed, a problem is the result of causes that are often more various.
Than we think.
So when you have a wild culture, (that means when you have studied many subjects at school, such as biology, physics, or geography), you tend to have a more critical mind, and a better approach of the situations.
But in the other hand, a specialization on a specific subject is a good thing, because you are studying all the details of a specific phenomenon, and you are able to explain to people the accurate reality of a process.
You are also able to make the science go forward if you work on scientific subjects for many years, such as medical research.
Indeed, because time and specialization allow people to make big discoveries.
In conclusion, I really think that a wild knowledge may increased people critical mind, but there are also advantages to be specialized.
