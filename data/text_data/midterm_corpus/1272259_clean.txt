In my opinion in th coming years there will few cars left in th country side as it is today. There are many reasons, it is really unsafe to walk on the road. The solution level is increasing, it difficult to live in metropolitan cities.
Firstly, as the population of the countries is increasing so the is much less space is required to built up the roads, which cause the people to send lot of time on the stops for green signal.As the time important key for each and every one people use to travel shortest distance on bicycle.
Secondly, the fossil fuels are deleting, which is only the fuel for the cars. In the coming years when it will be finished that bring halt of the cars. As the cars are generating to much noise and air pollution, the will harder there rule in the future which will decrease the number of vehicles in the future. In my opinion awareness must be brought in the people mind to make less use of cars as they are threat to the society.
Thirdly, the public transport is much continent and cheap for the people to travel. The metros are the best example to travel within the city. In the coming years, the government will prefer to spend on researches which give benefit to the whole society not to the specific class of people.
In conclusion, i want to say that it might be possible that the public transport take the place of cars. It may be possible that in the coming future be may travel the long distance through the planner. As the chance of accidents are increasing the people may prefer public transport than the private cars. Or scientist found air as the safer way to travel people may have another means of transportation.
