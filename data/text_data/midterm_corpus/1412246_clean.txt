Travel in group is the best way to travel, because you know new people and you can make new friends in all the travel, and the travel can be better if you have a tour guide that can explain all the parts of the place that you are going to visit.
When you are in group you file like you are in home and all the group take care of all, the guide is lake the mom who teach the group all the places that they want to know, and to explain who make some buildings o when the construction of one building started things that you really appreciate in a travel.
When you travel whit your family i thing that is boring that traveling with your friend, because when you are hut your family they always go to know museums or thinks that you really do not what to see, but when you go wit your friends and you have a funny tour guide that is a unforgettable experience, because you file like nobody is going to tell you watch to do or at what time you need to come back to the group.
When you travel alone i thing that you get bored so easy and you do not enjoy the travel, you only saw the building without now who was make or when was make i do not now things that really appreciate when you travel, but i thing that the convenience whit other persons is more nice that going alone whit nobody who make you smile or enjoy more the travel.
Traveling whit a group led by a tour guide is the best travel that you can have, no matter the place that you can go or the person that come with you, is more interesting.
I only say for the people who like to travel alone that are losing your time in a trip.
