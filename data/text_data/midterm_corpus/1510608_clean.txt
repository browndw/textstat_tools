I really agree with this statement, in life the people who try to discover new things taking risk have one motivation to still become better every day, is like a kind of auto motivation. For example in a Medical Doctor student, the professors has a study plan, but if the student limited to follow that plan he will only acquire the minimal information to become a doctor, but he do not will have the ability to success from over the other students so, the professional doctors not notice him presence to ask him to become a part of their team member.
People need to take risk, try different things, need to look not only that they have in front, they have to explore the world and improve new technology with this kind of activities they will success more than others that only do that they know how to do well, they never become a greater person, at work they never grow up, they will be confined to their sites for their lifetime.
An example of a success person who take risks and to more could be Bill Gates, he was a simple and normal student that love the computers but one day he has a dream, he begin to contact people, he do things, he promote his product and now, he is one of the most successful persons in world, because they don't want to do every day only things that he know well how to do, he want to improve new things, and he did it.
So in conclusion it is pretty obvious that the people who do more that they suppose to do, become much more successful that the people that only do what they already know how to do, and for this I invite to everyone to do more everyday, do all that you want to do, explore the world, enjoy the life, and success.
