This is a very difficult question to answer because I've seen some old people enjoying their life everyday and some young people worry about their future and its challenges.
In my opinion, in general there is that idea that young people enjoy life more because they do not repose or comply to certain parameters or rules that society has constructed over us. This give us the impression that they are more relax but as always reality is by far more complex and comes in different colors and forms. Depending on the upbringing some young people can be very methodical, working very hard for their future and are often in a constant battle against time to get a place in society.
Another point I would like to mention is the definition of "enjoy" or perhaps "joy". As I mentioned before people are complex creatures so they enjoy a wide range of activities. Some of these activities can be considered not very enjoyable for some other people with different interest. Take botany, plant science, as an example for some individuals spending days and nights looking at plants and checking their parts is very rewarding and definitely it forms part of the joy of their life. On the other hand, somebody whose main interest is robotics or clubbing, just to mention two extreme examples, would have some difficulties understanding other people source of joy.
Older people especially the ones who are already retired tend to have a very tranquil and quiet life, but then again this has a lot to do with the Jeffords they made when they were younger planning their finances so they can have a decent pension and as a result a more enjoyable life. I've seen people who plan very carefully to make sure they will not become a burden for their family and society.
As a conclusion I think you chose to enjoy your life regardless your age. However to reach a sustainable state of security and stability, so you can enjoy life more, some planning is indeed necessary at any stage of your life.
