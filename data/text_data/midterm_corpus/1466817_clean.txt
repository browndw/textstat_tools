It is important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn the facts, i agree with this that students should understand the ideas of the concept.
Knowledge of the student is behind the theory. He can do through theoretical. Students should get ideas on the both theoretical and the practical tests.
In the theory we will get the concept and in the practical we will get the knowledge in detail what is happening in that concept.
A student can learn and understand and anything can be made through theoretical or practical.
By getting the ideas the student can improve his knowledge.
In the theoretical he can get the ideas but up to certain limit, where as in the practical test we will get the ideas in the death.
In the practical test we can learn the concept in detail, and with the ideas we the do the experiment.
With out the ideas and the concept we can,t perform anything. First we have to get an idea and the description of concept going to be performed in that concept.
Student can improve the communication skills he can improve his ideas.
Ideas are the strength of the students, with out the ideas student can not be performed.
If any one of them ask for an idea we will be in a stage to give the idea.
Knowledge is the power of the student, and the concept.
Without the concept we can't do nothing, for every small example there will be a concept, and without this concept we can not perform anything.
What we are going to achieve, and students should understand the ides and the concept.
This are the specific reasons for the students to understand ideas and concept.
Concept will give the ability what is going to be performed.
