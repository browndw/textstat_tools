I agree that the, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, for several response.
First, this is the way of studying. If the students want to be successful in their study they must to understand the ideas and concepts first. For example, if the student has a hagiography class and the teacher gave him or her the information what he or she needs. But they are ideas, and they agonist the facts. Then, the same students has an exam in the same class. And he or she faced a question about the information, which is the teacher gave him or her. Then, he or she wanted to write the answer to that question and the answer was an idea, which is agonist the fact. If the students wrote the fact, he or she will miss the point, but he or he wrote the same conformation , which is the professor has given her or him, he or she will get the point. Therefore, this is very important.
Second, it be helpful for students on the future and increases the knowledge of them. How it is come? Learning the idea and the concepts is leading to facts. For example, if the students learn the ideas and the concepts, then they knew there are facts about the same things that will encourage them to find the facts. And if they kept in the same way, which is understand the idea and the concepts, then they will have really great knowledge and that will help them in the future. Therefore, the that will increases the students' knowledge.
In short, it is nice to learn facts too but I still agree that was why I agree that " it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is foot them to learn facts. " So, ideas and concepts then facts.
