I don't think that successful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
Of course we all no famous examples of people being successful in making a new invention, trying new ways of business or starting new directions in arts, music and literature. But I think this is not the majority of the successful people. I rather think that the personality of them is usually another one, which is my first point against the statement.It is always easier to do what people accept somebody to do and to use old methods to become a successful person. It might be sad, but it is rather likely to become successful by using old "tricks", your family background or connections. So I think the personality of most of successful people is rather one, which uses the old ways, than one, that tries new ways. We only sometimes think that the opposite is true, because people, which were successful in making a new invention for example are more important for other people and for us. So we know them better. And when a successful businessman try for example a new trading practice, he has a better chance to make good money, because he has already a helpfully background. And once more we will hear about him more likely, alt how most of successful businessmen would not do this.
My second important point is, that a person, which is working and living successfully has no reason for trying new methods or changing his live. Why should such a person take a risk? The history shows for example, that most of the people coming to America were poor people, which had nothing to lose. The richer ones usually stayed in there country, where they had a safe live.
