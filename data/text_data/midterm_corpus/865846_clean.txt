I agree with the stamen that "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well", for the following reasons:
First af all, learning is not a steady situation, learning is a dynamic process, and to be successful you never stop learning, and in this process you gain experience, and maintaining working the brain with new challenges is the best work out to became successful, trying new things and taking risks is a kind of learning.
Second, if you knew more, then you are better prepared, furthermore you can apply your vast knowledge to your every day activities, and this allows you to go with new ideas and improve what you use to do, and also solve problems more easily than the people who don't like to think.
Third, Take risks is also a great tool in the learning process, and it drives you to be better in life, because if you don't take risks is like you are not doing anything, and if you do not anything you may not make mistakes, and another way to learn is from your mistakes, and also this is a dynamic process which allows you to improve your life and became successful.
Fourth, people who just do the things that they already know how to do well is because they lack of imagination, and they look like robots, following mechanically what they have learned.
Fit, active and smart people always are trying to do different things, and their personality most of the time shows confident in what they are doing, more over it is contagious in the positive way.
For all those reasons explained above I think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
