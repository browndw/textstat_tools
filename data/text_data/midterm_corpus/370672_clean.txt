Colleges nowadays offer a huge variety of classes. Books on library shelves talk about every subject one could think of. People, students in particular, are left wandering whether it's better to concentrate on something in particular or on many different subjects. I believe it is better to have a broad knowledge, basically for three reasons.
First of all when you go to college the maturity of adulthood is still far away. Seldom have I met undergraduate students who already knew what they wanted to do in life. Because of this I think one should try to develop a broad knowledge on different subjects. A border knowledge will give you a broader perspective to life, an open mind and the ability to make the best of the opportunities life will give you.
In addiction to that, personally I would never spend three or more years of my life specializing on the same subject. I know there are people who do, and some of them seem to like it: for instance my friend Glamorous has been studying the behavior of earth worms for the whole last semester! I could never do something similar. Concentrating on the same matter for too long can be boring. Studying is already so difficult, facing new issues and interesting matters often can help to cope with the burden of the deadlines, midterm papers, books, and so on. This is worth for young students but for adults as well.
In conclusion statistics have been carried out on people who attended classes on different subjects when they were at college, which basically means they have a board knowledge rather than a specialized one. The results show that they usually have higher wages than people who concentrated on a specific academic subject. This of course does not mean that taking up photography and biology will make you a better person than someone who knows Plato's "Republic" by heart, or has studied French for all his life. But it does mean than generally you will be more adaptive, which is a key quality in nowadays ever- changing world.
