I don't think young people enjoy life than older people do. It seem to be so, because younger people are energetic and spirited than elder people, and the ranges of action they can do are wider than elder. That's why elder people say "the youth enjoy their life than us."
However, I doubt young people is more enjoyed their life than elder people?
The first reason is that the the youth impossible to escape from coming across the lot of problems. The problems are may be about friends, parents, future, and oneself. They don't know how to handle them.
They have to think over about problems, and experience difficult situation, and spend hard time. And then, they finally find the way of solution by oneself. This process need for growing to adult. And then, when they mature enough, they finally know how to enjoy the life actually. Sometimes, the youth enjoying themselves mean escaping from uneasy. So it's not real enjoy. Just discourse.
And there is also money aspect. For example, I love music very much, and also desire to go the gig of the favorite artists. However when I was high school student, i never go the gig, just because Id didn't have enough money. But after entering University, I started to work as a pirate time, and finally could go the gig. That was wonderful expelling. But still now, the times I could go the gig is limited. Because the capital is shortage. My friend who is already work as full- part time can go the gig whenever she wants.
So tha think elder people well know the solution way of difficult they encounter by experience and have well finance. So, they afford to enjoy their life than the youth.
