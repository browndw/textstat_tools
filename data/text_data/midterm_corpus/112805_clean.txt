Nowadays, some may hold opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of any academic subjects then to specialize o=in one specific subject. However, others may hold negative opinion about it. As far as I am concerned, I do not agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
First of all, people will not study very well if they learn many academic subjects. Because they need to spare their time on so many subjects. We all know that the more you spend on doing one thing is better than the less you spend on doing one thing. The result for you spend one hour on study is different from the result for you spend eight hours on study. If you spend more time on one subject, you will know more about it. But if you spend time on so many subjects, you cannot deeply learn about them.
Secondly, if you have one special skill, it is easier for you to find future job. Because you have specialize knowledge in one specific subject. Many companies need people who have special skill. For instance, in Canada, it is lack of people who know how to build cable. If a person has that skill , he can easily find a job and get higher pay.
However, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can easily find jobs, such as in the foreign companies, they require people to speak 2 or 3 languages. They may can speak 2 or 3 languages, but they may not know how to write them.
It is better to have specialize in one specific subject than broad knowledge of many academic subjects. People can learn very well in one subject rather than in many subjects.
