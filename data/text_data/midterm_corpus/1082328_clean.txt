I think this is a general statement, and it is too difficult discussing about this without following in born thinks.
However, i disagree with this sentence. Firs of all because i know many boys and girls that do not enjoy in their everyday life. They seem to need ever something else, they are not able to be happy for what they do. Everything becomes a problems: the wedding, the children, the job. I recognize the we live in a difficult time, the politic affairs and the economic once are not very good, and also there is the war... But i ask to myself: what are the differences between the actual and last times? My father yolk to me about the second world war, and also about the problems the he had had for finding something to eat end than the problems he had had to take a job.
My father dead three years ago, but i think he enjoyed his life more than many young people.
I want to talk about another point: the wedding. I see that many people now prefer the divorce to the possibility to solve the problems. I do not understood very well this position. For me having a family is a way to get better our life, but probably i wrong because many people i know do not think in the same way. I want to enjoy living along or going out until 5 or 6 a.m. So they refuse the idea to build a family until they are 35 or 37 years old.
Probably i am the firs person that does not enjoy naught her life. I try every day to put passion and love in what i do, specially from the time i live alone, now i have no father and no mother, but i see that if i am correct with other persons i am not alone.
