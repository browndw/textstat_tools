Yes i do. In my opinion i thing that the best way to travel is alone, not in group, ill tell why.
First if you era in a travel group you eve told follow the guide and the rest of the group, that indicate so you don't have the time to enjoy the things that like you, the pictures are faster, quickly and other things that happen usually.
A travel group led by a guide tour could be not exited, because all the information is short and in man cases are incorrect. You supposed that the guide knows everything, buy in some cases or some places don't have the education or not are prepared.
I am not saying that all is bad, it have some point on its side, you can ask, and always you will find a perfect answer.
If i travel alone i can enjoy every thing that interest me. Personally i am an architect, i like watch carefully the environment, like buildings, plazas, streets, houses and nature, and for those reasons i thing i cant enjoy a group tour.
On the other hand is more interesting if you construct your nonlegal because it will for ever, you can get immediately reference of places or buildings, and one important part i cant take pictures like i want.
I prefer take my time and not make any plan of the things that i going to. That not the sense of a travel. A travel is to get relax, drink some coffee in a little coffee shop, walk through the cities, visit some historical places, visit museums and why not meet people.

Finally i wish i cant travel by around the word alone and have many pictures and many histories to steel you when i came back.
