According to the my point of view of the fact, ubiquitous in my view. Young people enjoy life, better when compared to older ones, because they had more opportunities to enjoy in a better way, in terms of various scientific inventions which paved the platform for indulgence in various activities.To substantiate my wordings i give the following reasons.. The young are more energetic, enthusiastic.The heated blood within them makes them more career oriented.According to the medical facts. People tend to go older in their in mind and body,as the age advances.to the older ones are more responsible in their acts, hence they pay deaf ear to such enjoying acts. On the contrary, the young are free from responsibilities. They depend not holy on the old, but to the fact on some occasions like guidance..they show various patterns of enjoyment, example, with friend to roam about,in disco"s,in various cultural weatherization.on the hold people when turn old donor show much interest in various outdoor source of enjoyments. But prefer to stay calm and cold. The young enjoy by the latest advancements in modern scientific technology, what i mean is the Television, internet, cell phones, automobiles, music,increased career opportunities led to the fulfillment of goals, which led to further enjoyment, pleasure, satisfaction in what ever they do.on the contrast older ones, are more oriented in family development, mental peace, and various other activities which make them comfortable. Order to strengthen my facts.According to the current statistical medical records.70% of the people rededicated to vote that young enjoy better when compared to older ones. .Hence therefore,it is mandatory to stick to the vague fact that young enjoy more when compared to the older ones.But i stake to say that young ones enjoy better than old, but they have to enjoy with th older ones.
