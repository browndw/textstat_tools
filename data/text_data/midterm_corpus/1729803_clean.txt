The the best way to travel does not has to be in a group with a specific tour guide.
I have visited many countries with my family and very few of them had been with a tour guide, most of the times, we do research on the country we are going to visit and prefer to get as much information about the touristic places as we can. And we plan our own tour as a family, if we want to make a stop or stay more time in a specific place, we can do it, but we would not be able to do this if we were traveling as a group because we have already a schedule. Which we have to respect due to the rest of people we are traveling with.
We have also traveled with a group, with friends of the entire family, it is a lot of fun because we share lots of great moments, but even tough, we do not travel with a tour guide, we also plan our own tour before the trip.
Six years ago, we took a trip to Val Colorado with another family, great friends of ours. In total we were 10 people, five from my family and five from their family. We went skying at the Val mountains, even tough my parents, my brothers and I had already skied, this was a new experience. We enjoyed it that much that I can dare to say that it has been the best trip ever, we got the opportunity to share with the other family as well as we shared with ours.
We had such a great time that we made another trip together. This exciting trip made me sure that the best trips are not necessarily with a guide tour by your side.
