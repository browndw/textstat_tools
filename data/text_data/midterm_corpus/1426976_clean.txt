"successful people try to new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well", I agree with this statement because that the person cannot get success without doing new things. If he do the same thing that already done there is no anything special between the others and the successful person.
I strongly agree with this statement.
Example in our country there is one successful person in the business that he created many revolutions in the business system.He is the one of the greatest person's in our country. He use to do the new things instead of doing the same things. He started with small firm and developed many types of products, He was not satisfied with the business with the same products he started many types of business in different fields and established a big group of companies.
He is very successful person in that field even though he was ot satisfied with that. He use to invent new one and start that firm,With that capability he started many small products and became a successful person. He started many firms in all fields like in the field cell phones, pero chemicals , cotton firms and finance groups and got success. He is not satisfied with that same business he wants to invent Romany things mean the new things by that he became a successful person. He also took Romany risks to get succeed.
I conclude that it is correct statement that "successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well". By using the above examples i can state that the person should have guts to start the business in other field rather than in the same field he known well, It is also a risk to do new things but even though they know it is risk they use to do the new things that is the successful person's secret to success in life.
