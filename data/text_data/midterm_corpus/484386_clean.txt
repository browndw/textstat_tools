There are a lot of realness for and against this statement. I am young and I enjoy my live. But I do not think, that I can say this general only because I am young. Every year I pass through, I enjoy my live more and more. In this very moment, I think that my live will get better and better. I will have children and my own job. But than, I have my own job for a lot of years and perhaps I do not like this job? The question is, if I will be strong enough to change my life if I am older. Now I am young and can change easel my boyfriend, my maker and my city where I live. Later I can not do this. Of this reason I can come in a conflict with my live and than I can not enjoy my live.
Perhaps an older one said this sentence. Someone who lives this conflict and can not do what he or she want to?
My mother told me years ago that her life became better year to year. Her greatest experience was to get children.
Well, I hope that I do not feel to say this sentence later in my live. And I think, that everyone can enjoy their live if they recognize the wrong things in their life and than they can change it.
Perhaps this is a statement of someone who live in war. My grandparents were in the second world war and they do not tell great things about the war. Than I understand why someone say something like that. They had to work hart and help there mothers or they are directly in the war. I do not want to think of this hart times. But what will come to us, young people?
