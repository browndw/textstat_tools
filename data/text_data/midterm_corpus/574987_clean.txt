In this period a lot of young people haven`t a lot of time for help his communities; if every person go out for walk can see that the new generation don`t have an interesting to the community.
I think we can help the community with a very simple action every day when we make a foot over our house. I can divided the category express in the question into two another part: the young people that go to a primary school, and the people that go to the university.
I do this division because the person that are insert in this two category have only a little different of age but have a bigger different of think.
The young person who frequented the university have a responsibility of all the elements that are situated around you but the another division haven`t any type of respect in regard of the person and the object.
This young people have little time for helping the community because they spend a lot of time for themself, for buy a lot of object that can make better his aspect an his relations with the member of the group in which pass a lot of time during the day.
I don`t say that in every moment every people must do something for the community but I think that is most important have a respect of all the elements that are located around us.
It`s strange look in my town a lot of old person that do a lot of activity for make better the community or the town. For me is better see the young people do that, because certainly they can make it more fast.
I think that the young people have the necessary time for helping their community but they prefer spend it for another activity that make better themself.
In conclusion say that it`s most important help the community because the old person have create the community were we live, and us must do the same for created a better community for the future were our children can live.
