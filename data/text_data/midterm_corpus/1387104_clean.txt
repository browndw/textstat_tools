I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Everything in the world is based on it's own concept, no one can do things well except knowing the ideas and concepts.
The fact is based on the ideas and concept. You won't know the essential of things unless you try hard to understand its concepts. For example, when you are study a new word which you cannot see it straightly and it's hard to find it out immediately, the easiest and the fastest way to know it is to know its concept. If you think to see the fact is much more important, then you will spend a lot of time to find it out, so it's not that convenient.
Furthermore, to understand the concept of a thing is very important. When you study things as a student, you can't catch the real fact if you don't know its idea. When you are reading a novel, you even can't catch the idea, you even don't know what it is talking about, how can you image what's the fact is like? So, the idea is the basic thing for understanding.
And also, it's really important for students to know the concept when they are learning academic courses at school. For example, in the study of Physics, it's very easy to see the fact of any physical phenomena, but everyone know that how thing going, the point is to explain why it goes that way. So you need to resist the concepts of things based on again and again, then you can understand it and get learned.
Overall, the understanding of idea and concept are very necessary for us to understand. You may not really catch the real meaning by only seeing the facts, you need to understand the things in.
