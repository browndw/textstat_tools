Travel is something everyone is dreaming about. Get well prepare to enjoy his journey is an important factor. Choosing the destination is also what influences the most people when they are making plan for a trip, sometime we also have to choose if we need a partner or we just want to go alone.
Now the question come when it is time to go some place where we don't know anybody, a place we are visiting for the first time, and that may require a tour guide. A tour guide has a great benefit, it is usually a person who was born in that area, who lives there, who know the history of the place, the culture, the mentality of the society and can be a great help when we are looking place like good restaurants for cheap price. He can give us a good recommendation.
He also help to understand the culture, the society, the country we are visiting the history and the different dramas.
A tour guide has the benefit to be a professional. If we plan to lamb a mountain, he can saw us the best road, avoid some natural danger we don't know. We all listen the news, some countries are not that safe. In certain areas some tourists are been keeping as hostages. It is not something we aren't planning when we try to make a plane to travel. In those area I think a tour guide will be well recommended. It also help us when we want to buy some souvenir. Usually in develop countries the tourist is always see as a rich person. Local people may charge him more for a simple item.
For someone who is just going to the beach or planning to visit relative or family the tour guide is not necessary.
It depends on what we want to do and where we want to go.
Generally speaking a tour guide is a need when we are visiting big cites with history, special monument.
