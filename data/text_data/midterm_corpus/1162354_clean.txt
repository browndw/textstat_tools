I think for students to understand idea and concepts is more important than for them to learn facts.
I have very strong opinion about that. My favorite subject is math and i like math but i can tell i'm not surer good at math but it's alright not really bad. On my way to do it math is i do not think about that the answer is. I need to know how should i solve it. If i just know the answer then what am i learning? To finding answer skills? Not really.
For history and math or other things to learn, first thing that you have to understand.You need to know what your doing.
My math teacher not only counts the answer. I need to show how i got this answers. If i only write the answer then i will lose my points. That is the idea that im telling. It would continue that if you have a same situation that you did before but you don't know what to do, then what are you going to do? Nothing.
I could tell the fact is just cover, and understand or concept is inside. I hope that people look at the inside.
Of coerce the fact is important we have to know what is correct or not. I know many people just want the fact expect the how did you understand. You have to make your own thing, that calls understand.
If you understand then you can solve easily that you expect.
Sometimes just look at the bright side that do not just focusing on the fact. You need to know the way you did. It is more important for students to understand idea and concept than just facts. It should be good experience for your life.
