I think that it is correct to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people are more energetic and dynamic than the old people. Young people enjoy in different ways by engaging in different activities.For example they enjoy by playing basket ball, soccer, rugby and so on but the old people who are not that much energetic cannot get engaged in the sports as much as the young.
Also the young people have no possibilities as they are mostly dependent on their parents for the money so they enjoy as they wish.The older people will be mostly retired from the work and they need to save the for their future purposes.Example for health care needs, food, shelter and so on.
The old people are more prone to diseases than the younger people as they tend to have lesser immunity than the young. So they will be spending more time in the hospital than outside.For example you take a old man who is suffering from pains of the joint due to osteoarthritis he will not get cured during his life span but it can be suppressed by using medicines.The diseases like carcinoma, gout,arthritis occur more commonly in older people as their immune system has degraded with age.
The old people also may have their wives or husbands who is not a working partner may increase the responsibility of the other person.
The old people also have lot of thoughts in their brain might be family problems or the business tensions but such things are not there for young .They can enjoy to the maximum as no opposing forces like money might not be a real problem.
I conclude by saying that old people are the people who have many responsibilities and mutilated by so many factors but on the other hand young people donor have so many tensions and problems.So there is more chance for the young people to enjoy than the older ones.
