Every people enjoy to do different things. Some of they thing reading is the most enjoyed thing on the world but the other side some of them think hanging out with friends is the most enjoying thing ot the world. Going outside more, playing some games or living life little bit faster than other people doesn't make life to more enjoying.
Go to the disco or playing to the computer maybe able to make life enjoying for some young people but the same time it sound be very boring for older people.
Usually older people like to quite place.They enjoy to do reading book or newspaper, gardening or that kind of relaxing and enjoying works. Some times Grandparents and grandchildren go to vacation at summer time together. Usually grandchildren go to pool or beach and swim all day or play something with their friends. Grandparents usually stay at home or hotel and they spent their time relaxing. It doesn't mean they are not enjoy. It is not just about they like or not like. The other side their body need to be relaxing.so they chose these way and when they relax they could be happy.When the young people see old people relaxing or doing nothing they think older people are not enjoy life like them. But it is not true.
There is a different examples. These days teenagers spend most of their time on computer, internet or tv. They sitting all they in the same room and they just looking some unreal vision on the screen. And older people said that it is boring to spent all their they in front of the screen but if you ask the young people it is lot of fun.
Everybody like to do different things. The fact is if you do the things which you really like your life is enjoying. Doesn't matter what the other people thing about that or how it is seen. The important thing is you like it.
