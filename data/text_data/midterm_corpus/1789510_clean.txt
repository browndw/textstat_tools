According to the statement, there should be knowledge on the academic subjects and should gain more knowledge on specialize specific subject.
'I disagree the statement.
According to the passage there should have some knowledge on other subjects, than the specialized subject. For example take an electrical student his subjects are totally consider of electricity, power stations, grids,captors, insulators, and etc..,if he has knowledge o9n this subject he can move forward for higher studies. If the subjects for electrical student he have material management, environmental science, and etc.., was the use if he gains more knowledge on this subject. He cant for social subjects r static r banking.

I wont tell that the student should not have knowledge on this subjects but he have to know some knowledge on these subjects.
If he gains more knowledge on the specialized subjects ho will move on his course go forward for any comparative exams he will perform good and he will get score in that exam and he don't want to jump into other banking exams .

And he keep his interest on his specialized subjects rather than his the specialized subjects, he will become top scorer i any exams and he might be famous all over the world and he is king of all continents. If he worked same for the board knowledge of many academic subjects as well as specialize subject he lost his much time on the board subjects. If he spent that time for specialize subject he gain more knowledge and he can score top in that subject and he can be school first for ever.
From conclusion i give message that keep knowledge on the board subjects, but don't neglect that subject and keep hard working on the specialize in one specific subject for more knowledge.
