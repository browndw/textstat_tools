I don't agree at all with the idea that a young generally enjoys life more than older people do. We usually think about youth as a golden period of our life where we experience many unforgettable moments while we tend to consider the final period of our existence as the most painful one. Nevertheless we have to consider also the other side of the coin as a young person usually faces many difficulties an older person doesn't deal with anymore.
There are in my opinion three different kinds of problems you face in when you are young.
First of all, everything is brand new to a you. You pass through a lot of experiences you don't know how to deal with because you lack the required experience about it. This often creates fears and doubts that is quite difficult to cope with unless you get the help of an older knowledge person. For instance the doubts faced for the choice of a university, a crucial step in life, can be lived in a very negative way and can create a big sense of lack of direction.
Secondly there are many situations that during your life you experience several times thus getting used to them. But when you are young and you experience these situations for the first time you are much more sensible to them than a older person would be. A typical example is love. A young person usually suffers much more than a older one because of love relationships because they are not yet used to them while getting older you acquire the experience that allows you to suffer less.
In the end, when you are young you don't know yourself very well since you are not aware of your strengths and weaknesses. This can cause a serious lack of self- confidence that creates very unpleasant feelings and thoughts in young person. When you get older, instead, you are aware of your success and failures and you get no more disappointed by them.
