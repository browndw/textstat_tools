Every day we face decisions that make us do something better trying a new way. But we usually forget them and focuses only on the big one decision because those can completely change our life. Successful people usually are more lucky with those great decisions, but I do believe that successful people are not only those who take risks, but those who can understand when take a risk trying something new, and also if their decision affects negatively other people. Many situations in life could determine if a risk is worth taking, and are related to the field in which the decision are taken and the fallout of this decision.
For example a basketball coach could face the situation in which he has to decide to try something new and unusual to win a game, such changing the defense schemes that help him win many games in the past. In this case the risk could pay off and give him success.
On the other hand if someone is a very good medical doctor, he has many patients and has a large family, but suddenly he decides to became a professional painter that risk would only hurt his patients, leaving them without a cure, and his family, leaving them without financial support. For them he was already successful by doing what he learned and was trained to do.
I think that one major mistake that we usually commit is to measure success with creativity. Of course a person can be successful if he do something in a new way, but there can be success also in attaining excellence in a field. I do believe that the ability to take rational risks is very valuable, but otherwise it is more easy to be the better one doing something if you already are doing this particular things.
