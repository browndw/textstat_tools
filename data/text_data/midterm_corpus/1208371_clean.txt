I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I think the trip will be well- planned, enjoyable, and economical in this way.
A tour guide usually knows the resort well. Therefore, he or she most likely has a good plan of where to visit, where to eat, where to take pictures, and where to stay for the nights. I went to the Niagara Falls in a group led by a tour guide. The guide talked about the history and formation of the Falls on the bus. We stopped at a small and good restaurant for lunch. In the afternoon, he took us directly to the best spots of views. I did not spent any time looking up a map and figuring out where to go.
It is enjoyable to travel with a group led by a tour guide. We can talk on the way. We can also make friends with each other. We can help each other when needed. When I went to the Smoky Mountain last summer, we were talking and singing on the bus. It was one of the best memories of my vacation.
It is also economical to travel with a group led by a tour guide. People can share the expenses of renting a bus or a car. They can share the expenses on gas and tolls as well. Sometimes it is cheaper to buy bulk tickets than to buy each ticket individually. For example, if a ticket costs twenty dollars for one, it might only cost fifteen dollars each if you buy ten of them at the same time.
These are the reasons why I think it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide.
