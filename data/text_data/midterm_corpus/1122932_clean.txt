Youngsters and community aid.
I believe the implication of young people in helping their community will vary from one country to another. Focusing In my home country, Spain, I must say that I do agree in general terms with the statement proposed.
The decline in social concern that western countries like Saipan are experiencing is due, in my opinion, to two main factors: the improvement in the quality of life of middle class families and the reduction in the size of families.
Spain has changed a lot in the past thirty five years. While some decades ago we still had a considerable proportion of our population living in conditions of poverty, that is not the case anymore. Middle class has boosted in Spain and nowadays it is one of the countries with the most disperse distribution of wealth. In this new situation there are less class differences and therefore the need of helping the community is not so evident to young people.
Another important social change in Spain has been the dramatic reduction of average family size. Thirty years ago there were very seldom one- child families in Spain. Today, this is the most common situation of families. One-child families usually tend to over- protect the lonely child, and these children become less concerned about social aspects of life. Therefore they do not spot the need to help the community afterwards when they grow up and become youngsters.
These two reasons just express my opinion and must be taken in general terms. I am sure there are a lot of other reasons why young people do not give time to helping the community, but I consider these two as the most important ones. It is also important to take into account that there are exceptions, I know young people that devote a lot of time to help their communities and even some that work full time in fields related with community aid, but I just feel this is not the general behavior of this generation.
