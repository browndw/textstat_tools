Contrary to popular belief, there are many people who are quite successful although they did not invent new things and therefore had no risk, such as people who inherited a fortune. However, i am convinced that you normally have to be innovative to be successful in life. I will try to explain this with the help of economic and political successful persons as well as persons who lead a perfectly well marriage.
Firstly, people who succeeded in earning a lot of money, such as bosses of big companies, must often find a new way to sell things. If you take Reinhold further, a famous economist and one of the richest men in the world, this becomes quite clear; for example, he sells highly specialized manufacturing tools. Certainly, he had to find this gap in the market and it was a great risk to sell such specialized tools at the beginning.
Secondly, successful politicians have to be extraordinary and thus have to have new ideas. Of course,it is also critical to have a common knowledge, but the crucial point is to be innovative. Imagine a politician who just acts and thinks in a way everyone else do. He would never become famous and no one would know him. However, this includes to take responsibility for others and this also means to take risks.
Finally, one must take into consideration that people who are happily married are successful in some way. It is a well- known fact that finding an appropriate partner is highly difficult. People who found there true love had to take the risk of failure.
To draw a conclusion, i would say that there are many different ways to be successful. However, regardless of which way you consider as really successful, you have to meet the general criteria which i have just mentioned.
