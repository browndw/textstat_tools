There are three reasons why I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. It is because I believe that students will not be able to learn the facts unless they understand its ideas and concepts, it is very likely for them to forget the facts if they skip the step to understand ideas and concepts, and if they have no knowledge on how the fact becomes a fact they will not be able to teach or explain it to other people.
Firstly, the pupils will not be able to learn the facts completely unless they understand ideas or concepts since the facts are formed from the concepts. I cannot imagine myself learning a fact and understanding it perfectly without the knowledge of its background.
Secondly, the facts that are being learned will not remain in the students' heads just by memorizing them. Unless they understand the ideas and concepts of it, they will soon forget it, for example after the unit test is over. That will definitely not benefit their lives in the future and it would mean that the time they spent on learning the fact was meaningless after all.
Lastly, the students who learn the facts without understanding the concepts and ideas will not be able to teach or explain about the topic to others. I feel that it is a shame for them, and I will be embarrassed if I am in a situation where I cannot make a thorough explanation when I should know something about it.
In conclusion, I agree to the statement "it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts." Because students cannot learn facts without understanding ideas and concepts, the facts will not benefit them without the knowledge of the background, and they will not be able to teach and explain to their peers when they do not have the understanding of ideas and concepts. I believe that to understand ideas and concepts is an necessary step to be skipped.
