Many students have different varsity for taking the information some who have more important to understand the problem and known the concepts, but the other one how think that learn facts could be ok. In my opining I think that understood the ideas and concepts could be more helpful than just learn the fact for many reason.
First of all, when you knew the ideas you can magician who can be it or you give this information especial idea that make you understood it immediately. For example, when the teacher said " the people die " you knew that is fact but you do not know why, but when the teacher said " the people die because they may be infection by dishes or when he in the war the killed and so on". You can understand that very easily and in you word and imagination.
Second, knowing the concepts is other point to understood the information like in physic if you do not understand the point or in the experiment you should know the concepts which make you understand what you should doing during the test.
So as we see both of them are related which each other the ideas and concepts which make the thing more sens rather than knowing the fact, because immaterially you will ask you self man question. In instant, the boll will following down when you through it up the first thing you will ask who, why, and what is making it following down. But if you understand the ideas and the concepts you will not worry what will happen soon because you have ability do understand it depend in what you teacher explain it to you.
In brief, understanding the information is depend on what way you are chose on it is it good or not but as I said known or learn the facts it may be not the only the way of learning the information, it should followed by concepts which depend in which way you prefer.
