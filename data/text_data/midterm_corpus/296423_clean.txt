Nowadays , the people are not as the same as the people in the past. In the past they were wise enough and give enough time for everything .
The time now is very important , and we must be carefully of it , because it is in our hands and also everything now rely on the time .
But the young people , they want everything to to be done as quickly as possible. For example , they do not like to wait much .
They must do everything carefully and wisely and like this they will not waste time , and they can help their communities in everything , they can do all their works in a good way .
But , nowadays , they do not take care about these things , because of the new envisions , which make them like this. And we all are response about this , I mean that we must help the young people in everything that will make them take care of time to help their communities , because the young people can do everything better than the other people , and this is because they have a strength and the power to do difficult works .
For example , in the important places like banks , they want everything , whatever they do , to be done quickly .
And as i said , the new inventions today , make them like this , for example , the TV , computer , internet and another things. They make them careless , not care about the community generally , they will do everything they can do to make the time go faster .
In the end , I think that everyone must take care about the time , like he young people , because everything rely on them to make the community better , and to make it very beautiful in it , and we must help each other to do this.
