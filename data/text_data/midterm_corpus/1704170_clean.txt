If I travel in a group, I will enjoy the travel a lot because the tour guide know many good places to see. However, I disagree with this idea.
In my opinion, planning the travel is also enjoyable thing in the travel. If I travel in a group, I will not search about the place where I am going and the memory will not last nor vivid. If there is no one who help me with planning, I search details about the country and the experience will be helpful even in other situations. When I traveled in Okinawa with my friend, we planned our schedule by our selves. We hired a taxi and went to many places such as a glass- making shop. To tell the truth, the plan was not perfect. We had no time to go everywhere we planned, and finally we got lost and we had to ask helps to the people in Okinawa. That was not enjoyable memory, but through the experience, I felt the kindness of people in Okinawa and was touched because they were so friendly.
Of course there are some possibility of danger. We could get lost in the place we are traveling, like me -- I was lucky though, especially in foreign country that is a big problem. If there is a guide, we are relief when need some help in our emergency. However, if we are with other traveling people, we will not be able to feel the real culture in the place. We might be friends with other traveling people if we go in a group, but we will never make friends who live in the country.
Thus, I prefer to travel by myself or only with my friends. From searching the place to making plans, including getting lost, everything is the precious memory.
