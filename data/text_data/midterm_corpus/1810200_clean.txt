The question says that "It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts".
I agree with statement because ,"In this computing world students are becoming machinery day by day.They are not getting the ideas and concepts behind the subject .They are simply remembering the things to produce in the future.But i am sure that this will not improve the student's knowledge and his skills in future and also the student will not be known how to survive in this world after his education".
And it is the responsibility of the parents and teachers to move the students in correct path.They should encourage the student to study in his interested field.And if the student is not listening to the parent, then they should give the clear idea to the student what will be the situation if you do a small mistaken how it will help you in the future.If possible they should show him the consequences practically.so that the student can understand what is the situation and where he is standing in this competing world.
And more over the students future totally depends on the the ideas and concepts that he has in his mind from his child hood.The students must be cleared with his every doubts which he has.Because when he is cleared with the doubts (what ever he has in mind) he can understand the situation very clearly and the parents should give more examples to explain his doubt clearly so that he can move in a correct path.
So finally it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts.When the student get the idea and concept for the subject with many examples then he can get the new ideas of the same topic in an efficient way and is very easy to remember also.
