This is a very particular theme. In my opinion the thing that is better is the first affirmation. I think this because for a person in the world is more interesting to know something of every argument instead that only a specific sector. All this because a man with a little conscience of various argument can have a relationship with a lot of person in the world than a man that know only a singular sector. In the world of today the knowledge and the intelligence are two important elements that permit to the people to survive.
In the modern society is present the foulard of the most clever. Usually a man with a limited intelligence is condoned to suffer.
For me only in the case that a man lives only and makes a particular work without to have any relationships with other persons can have a specialization only in one specific subject.
But this discuss is valid for few people. An eclectic conscience permit, also if it's limited, a dialogue with a lot of persons. Sometimes a specialized conscience is not necessary because the the majority of the discuss that people do is general. Only in particular situation is request a specific conscience of a argument. This is my opinion, but is not law. Also because a limited conscience of a thing is better that no/knowledge. A life of success is possible only with a particular intelligence. In fact a man only with a intelligence more develop can have a lot of success in the own life and becomes a very important person. Usually the facts go in this way. Rarely a man becomes famous and important for a casual event. In the story of the world these facts are very rare.
In conclusion a person should have a developed knowledge in every sectors, so that he can speak and to have a relationship with other persons of different social level. In fact a intelligence person can speak with every person, intelligent or not, but a person with a limited conscience difficulty can have a relation with different person.
