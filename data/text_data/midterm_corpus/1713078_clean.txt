Both understanding ideas, concepts and learning facts are have a different role in the students.But I used to support understanding ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts.
As everything in the students academic classes are useful to the students so they must have an idea about that concept.So student can easily learn that topic and he can use that learn subject in his future. For example if the student has a topic on prevention of communicable diseases, how can he learn facts with out knowing about the concept so he should have some idea about that topic by seeing some practical conditions and there by he learn facts.
Understanding ideas are very important to the students as it gives him a solving of any critical problem.If the student understand ideas and concept of the problem, he may be aware of it.Not only that his mind his sharpen, his thinking power increases, his reasoning increase the by he can learn so many facts.
If they have the capability to understand ideas and concepts, they arises themselves a question and they will try to solve, there by their thinking ability increases.
It is also very important if the student has some idea about the topic, it is easier for the student to learn.
Some times idea about the topic gives him a doubts and he will do a research on it also.
If the student with ideas will always be a intelligent and his mind is sharper.If the student has an idea in one topic then he don't feel that is harder and he easily learn fact from that.
Even for the scientists also they first think about that topic and they come to one idea and they do researches and give us a facts.
Thus I conclude that idea about the concept is more to know the facts easier.
