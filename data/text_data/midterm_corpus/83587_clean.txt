I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people to.
While I would concede that older people are more likely to be struggling with health problems or to have experienced hardships over the course of their lives, these factors are not exclusive to older people. Moreover, one can enjoy life inspire of such negative experiences. Given the right circumstances, hardships paradoxically might increase your ability to enjoy life. If you have a positive attitude, misfortunes can teach you - at any age - to value the good things and the happy moments, to count your blessings. If, on the contrary, you have a pessimistic outlook on life and always find something to complain about, you will experience less joy in life, regardless of your age.
In addition to age, other outside factors, in my opinion, also play a much smaller role than is commonly assumed. At first glance, enjoying life would seem to come easy to people that are in good health, independently wealthy and feeling loved by a significant other or a close set of friends. But on second thought, when we try to remember the times we have felt happy and enjoyed life most, what come to mind are usually little precious (and fleeting) moments in time that had little to do with money, for instance. None of these positive outside factors hurt, of course. Nevertheless, I am sure we have all seen friends with chronic illnesses and empty bank accounts having a blast, while others have a tough time finding joy in seemingly rich and full lives.
All in all, I disagree with the statement because enjoying life does not depend on age or other external factors as much as on one's personality and attitude. A little lucky star, of course, does not hurt.
