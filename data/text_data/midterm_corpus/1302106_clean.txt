I agree that most advertisements really make products seem much better than the products really are, and that is why people make the advertisements for their products because they want to sell them for money. Businessmen do not care about other people' right, only things they just wanted is money, money, and money. Though some products which are made by famous companies are actually pretty great, but most of product are not as well as the advertisements shown.
I still remember when I was a child, I saw a very cool advertisement of a toy, but my parents told me I should not buy that because the real thing is impossible as well as the advertisement said. I disagreed with them and finally bought the toy which I wanted at that time. After I got home, I was so exciting and open it without taking off my shoes, and I found out I was wrong. It was the worst toy I had ever seen before. I felt so sad. I was crying for whole night.
After that time, I do not believe those beautiful advertisements. I think it really dishonest for people who bought these products. The businessmen make the advertisements which are too different from the real things. It is fine for me if there is only a little different between the products and advertisements. But sadly most of advertisements for the products are too "wonderful" which make me think it is impossible to be. I really hate those advertisements, but that is how the things work, I could not change that. I think in the furniture there will still be a lot of people buy those amazing products, and they would understand and learn a new lesson, "do not trust those advertisements anymore."
