First of all i would like to approve my opinion on this statement. This is just what i would like to talk about , people who take risks and try new stuff tend to get more successful in their life , on the other hand people who tend to be close minded and only do what they know and in the same way over and over again , this would improve them at all .
When people try new things they discover new information , they allow themselves to think differently , to act differently , not only would it help himself, it would also have great changes on the country. This type of behaviour is what we call a part of leadership.
When people do what they already know how to do well and keep on doing it over and over again , that would not help them at all , because they are doing the same pattern , without interacting with new features and by that they aren't learning.
In case of Newton , we wouldn't have known today how to measure forces and gravitational fields if it wasn't for his discoveries and his decisive state of mind. In other words if Newton haven't tried and experimented the stuff in different ways , he wouldn't have done what he did.
Scientists are trying really hard these days to find a cure to canister and they are trying new stuff and things and taking risks, in order to do the best they can to get to the cure ASAP.
In my point point of view i would take risks and try new things to get to the best state of knowledge i can get to. I am working so hard at the moment , trying new stuff and hoping to become a great man someday , hopefully soon .
My advise to you all is to experience new things and tryout stuff u never imagined your self doing it. You never know what might be the thing that you would end up with .
