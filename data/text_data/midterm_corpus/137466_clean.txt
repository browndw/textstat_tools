Students must understand ideas and concepts , on the other hand they must learn facts also. But the question is : what is better for them ???
Well as I see , learning facts is more important , because ideas and concepts depend on the person who give it to us , in another words , its may different from one person to other , so whats the reason of understand this ? On other hand facts , are as it is , in all the world , every time and everywhere .
For example , '' Tomes must work in order to help her Husband '' Somebody agree , others don't. Well , somebody says she has to work because she is a human as her husband , so she must work outside home , not only her husband. Others says , she is a WOMAN if she worked outside maybe somebody will hit her or even don't be fire with her because she is a lady. Here is an idea the first reason is more powerful than the other , so what we will gain if we study ideas ???
But if we studied facts , such as Theory Of Gravity. In this case we will improve our knowledge , know whats happen in the world and maybe we will take it for a research in order to get a Plumage on Physics or any other higher level. If we looked everywhere in colleges we will notice that almost of the study is studying facts. Also , what is a student ?? Student is a person who study to graduate from a recognized college , recognized from all over the world , so how can he study idea or concept and being recognized ? Recognized means that there is no doubt that he is right , so if he study a concept , what will happen if he is not on right way ?? He will lose everything he did for nothing .

And everybody has his own opinion .
