There is an old saying that if you can not be the best be the best of what you are Which i thing true if you concern the academic conditions people living in Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may have advantages as far as technical or culture any other knowledge but it may leave you directionless and without a view of future planning.
What if you have 3 diplomas and no job Simple but interesting argument You might be the most intellectual person on the planet Will it serve any purpose I don't think so if you have spent all those years studying examining or academically active True there is an aspect of personal indulgence but that is a rare case in my opinion For example you may have the information ability and resource to build a space craft Will you be able to pilot it or is it sense building it or flying that motivates one It is hard to answer but i would say the way you best is the shortest way when you consider someone spending years learning all that knowledge without feeling not even a small desire to fly.
For someone who specialized in one specific subject for example a mechanical engineer It is easier to appreciate the things he or she might accomplish That person will surely know devotion to his or her job or field of expert all because of one thing That person will keep everything on a personal level knowing that someone else is doing something else important at very same level of concentration at something like a research or a development.
There are exceptions of course like the modern geniuses like Einstein but do we all have that level of IQ Is it safe the concentrate on everything rather than one thing at the point you are giving your live a direction No one wants be left without out a vision because he or she have too many before they realizes that they have to make a choice.
