In my life i met a different people. Some of these have a various knowledge about many many topics and they have their opinion on somethings. Others of these know very well a subject only.
In my opinion is very important have a knowledge on many topics and is not good know a topic only and can talk about the same topic only.
I would be like a first type of people, because know everything make a general view of the world and of what happened in the world.
Then knowledge open your mind and take to be a more pleasure person.
One times i met a man who know everything. He is a very likely person, because with him can speak on all and can argue on all. He has a his opinion always and on everything. Then i learned somethings by him, he know more then others always, and he have an explanation on all what you ask him always. He is a very interesting person thanks for his huge knowledge.
On this example my opinion is better on people who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than people to specialize in one specific subject. For this I would be like man who i had a description before.
In final, there are many different people, these can be put in two categories. In the first one there are a people that have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Instead, in the second one there are a people that specialize in one specific subject.
In based on the example that i reported and in based on my experience i agree with the statement, or rather I have many consideration on the people that know many things and for this they have a their opinion on everything. It is a very good things. I hope that I will learn many things to know somethings on.
