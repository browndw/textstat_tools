In this case i could agree because when someone travel to a new place its because he/she want to know that place or spend a good time there. So i think when people look for help from a guide or someone who can help them, it would be a great idea to have fun and save time. People ask themselves.. Why save time? Because in many times family or groups of people who want to travel never take precautions about some risk that they could have in their travel. When we talk about risk we could say... They don't know the city, the don't know the culture( different countries), they don't know a good place to stay or sometimes they don't speak the language from that place, in many cases people have been mad or sad because they lost time or they lost their vacations for don't take good precautions. Therefore its vital when someone want to travel to take precautions.
For other side when people know everything or almost everything about the place, its not necessary to ask help to a guide. Like that they can be alone and get privacy. Also they can feel free when they want to choose their decisions.
In my case i like to plain before of travel, i wouldn't like loose my vacations or spend bad time. For me its different when i travel with my friends, because when we are young, we love the adventures and enjoy crazy times with your friends, of course..with responsibility. So when i travel with my friends i don't plain too much. In other side when i travel with my family its different because i travel with adult people, we look for spend a good time in family everyone together, therefore we have to plain better our trips.
In conclusion i agree with the statement because its better take precautions then spend a bad time looking for help.
