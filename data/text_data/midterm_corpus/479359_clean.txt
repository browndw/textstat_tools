It is an undeniable fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are so many reasons that influence their point of view about life; their social environment affect their life and they have so much energy and time.
It can be said that young people generally attend the school and they have an environment in the school; in other words, they have so many friends. Therefore, they can go to the cinema or theater together and also, they can just sit in a cafe; however, old people do not have an opportunity for these activities. These small things make young people happy and enthusiastic about the life; that is to say, they do not become pessimistic about life. Moreover, they can come together and play a game such as taboo or scrabble; on the other hand, you cannot see old people while playing such games.
Another issue is that young people have so much energy; therefore, they choose some sports in order to spend their energy. For instance, they do extreme sports such as bungee- jumping. Can you think that most of the old people can do such a sport?
Finally, time can be considered as an important reason for young people in order to enjoy the life. Older people have to work most of the time and they do not have so much time for entertainment. They can get bored from working but, they do not any time for having a rest. In contrast, young people can spare their time for entertainment. They have a certain school schedule, but they are free after the school. They do not have to consider the director or manager like old people do.
For all of these reasons, it can be indicated that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Their social life their energy and time make them enjoy the life.
