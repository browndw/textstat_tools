Successful people try to new work or create one is better than do only what they know. I agree this quote. Pixar company and GYP is one of successful people. Successful people try new thing is better than only doing one work.
First, Pixar is one of famous film company. This company always make to new idea and story. People try to using different to techie. However, If this famous company pillar always make to same story and same idea for film, watching people does not interesting about that film anymore. These day people want to new one and different style like people want to new cell phone or many option thing. So, successful people need to try new create amid running to their line.
Second, GYP is famous singer or writer musicians in Korea.
In Korea, since 1994 he always make to shocking music and create to new singer. GYP does not stay same work or day in Korea. He try to sell his music in New York. That time, Asia musician try to sell their music but they are always go back to their country. However, like that situation GYP do not give up his work. He look back for asi musician failing. He know, they did same work like their success in their country and used to same way in New York. So, He change to his mind and make to create music not same, He can sell his music to Will Smith and Mae. He can becalm first Asian sell music in New York. These day, He still in New York and He doing new project.
He just not sing and writer music in Korea, he look for new work and try.Like that, Successful people have know move their place.
The fore, Who people success dose not stay their same place, they try to new place or work is better than that.
