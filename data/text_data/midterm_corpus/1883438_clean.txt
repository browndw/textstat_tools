This is not a topic for a TOEFL test, but could be a final work of a master degree in law science.
But we can try to tell something also about this....
In my opinion we live in a world in which the publicity is too much important, compared to which it effectively keep.....
In a year, in our crazy world, the big societies spend much more many for the publicity instead than for the safeness of their habiliments (and consequently of their workers)....much more than for the insurances of their workers.....much more than the development of the society in a contest of "Social Responsibility"......
It's horrible!
But it's our world.
There are many consequences of this scandalous behavior, some of which kills a lot of persons every years, others that fired workers every day, others that make poor person to be more poor.... Etc etc etc....
But in this tragedy, we, the person who not have a relative dead in a factory or who don't have a friend who cannot arrive at the and of the month, we impact only on the face of the problem: the product and the publicity; or better, the contrast between the product what we aspect to find: usually an abyss.
I don't know what to say about this...... It's normal: propose something to the client and construct something different, is the best way (and it's legal!!!!!!!!!) to reach much much much money in few time.
And we know this to be the first aim of a society.
