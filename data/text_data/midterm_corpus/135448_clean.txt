Advertisements, the word that because it I start to be crazy. Everywhere, every time you will see or hear an ad. Because the many times that you had saw it or heard it you start to lose their truth. With the increasing in technology you are surround with ads from every where while you at the home, while you in the car, while you using the cell phone or the internet, and know while you using the public bathroom!!.
I belie that the ads some times let me buy a product but when hay start to show again and again, I start not to trust on the product.In that past, the ads used to tell the people about new products and that's it. But know the show the same products but with an offer. This thing create a question, why they make an offer if their product is successful. I heard a say that said" If your product cost 500 you should spend 1,000 for an ad" did you see the multiply of the number.
In this day the ways that the company use to create an ad is so crays. Like Nike, they spend more than 1,000,000,000 in their ads. I do not mean that their products are not good but I mean thy shout trust herself. At hoer example Hyundai when they made their cars with BMW cars. Or other company when hay pay for a star to make an ad for them, and with this all the people who love this star will do what s/he did.
It is seem clear that the companies start losing there customer because the hard work they do it to present their product. And I think if they pay all this one to improper the products will be better than to spend it in ads.
