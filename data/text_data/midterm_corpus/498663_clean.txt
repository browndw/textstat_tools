Times are changed. People do not understand that young people are not like their fathers. Is true that those young men do not help their communities in the way that in twenty century we refer to, but is true loos that they have different and important jobs. The first think that, for my opinion, a young person must do is study for his future, and, in a cert way, this must be seen like a help for the community, because a gait education can improve our future, can improve our workers, our economy and our life, so this is important not only for young person but collective future too.
And I see like my family believe in this opinion, in fact they support me in all of my decisions, they, in father words, built my future. And I see always in them a lot of proud for me.
I know that is important make same think for father people, but there are a lot of young people that make a civil services, they help community, for example, a lot of them work in Hospital without pay. Probably they are not a sufficient number, but is wonderful that in a time like our there is in them also a sentiment of generosity e charity, and I do not care if someone think that this new generations is without values, because for my opinion a generation that make in first place their future own and their man feeling is a gait generation. Of course there are loos same of them that do not want anything for father's or for themself, and that do not have respect for parent-s sacrifice. But I think that they are a little group of a wonderful generation, which I in it and I can tell this with proud.
