Students have many choices of their study methods. Learning facts are outweighed to understanding concepts in three ways because learning fact is easy, quick and efficient.
Firstly, fact is not abstract as concepts and ideas so it is easier to be comprehensive by students. Besides that, it is easy to remember to a fact than the long designations. In daily class, teachers always like to use some examples and facts to support his or hers opinion. When people talk to each other, someone threw a fact that nobody heard of before, people would think that person is knowledgeable and it is easy for those listeners to retell the facts to others.
Secondly, learning fact is a fast way to learn. Most of the facts do not contain only one concept or idea applied in the books. Since facts is not as simply as concept and idea, people are able to learn towns of concept and ideas though one fact. This can shorten the time of study because people only need to learn several facts and these facts maybe cover all the concepts and ideas in the books.
Last but not least, efficiency is another imprinted factor that made me think that learning fact is better way to learning concepts and ideas. People live in a society and things happen every second. Therefore, we can learn all the time when we communicate with the society. People can learn facts from talking to others, observing someone's action toward some event or even listening to the news on people's way back home. There are so many ways to learn facts and almost at no cost. Learning concepts and ideas are quite limited comparing to learning facts. People have to spend money on books and pay for the lectures.
To conclude, learning facts in easy, fast and efficient.
