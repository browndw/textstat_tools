Students learn many subjects in school.Teachers feel difficulties how to teach. Some people think that studying facts is more important than studying ideas and concepts. On the other hand, others believe that learning ideas and concepts is more important than leaning facts. In my opinion, knowing ideas and concepts is more important than knowing facts. I will explain reasons to support my view.
Ideas and concepts is helpful for students to understand facts. First of all, ideas and concepts are basic of all facts. Without basic theories, students can not understand facts. For instance, there are many theories to understand people's behaviors in psychology. I could understand others behaviors and my feelings by understanding these theories.Secondly, using ideas and concepts, individuals can develop ideas and extend their view of points. In short, ideas and concepts should be learned first.
Learning ideas and concepts enable students to solve problem quickly. First of all, students can think issues logically because ideas and concepts make problems easier to understand. Secondly, students learn skills effectively. For instance, to learn language, such as English, students need to learn grimmer and structure. Only listening native speaker's conversations is not enough to master English. In brief, ideas and concepts is useful for students.
Of course, learning facts is also important. However, usually facts are matters to support ideas or concept, therefore facts are supplement for them. In addition, observing facts is interesting and students are attracted study by watching facts, yet after all students need ideas or concepts to study their interests deeply.
To conclude, ideas and concepts is a necessity for students to consider subject deeply. On the other hand, facts are only one aspect of real phenomenon. Hence, it is not difficult to say that leaning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts.
