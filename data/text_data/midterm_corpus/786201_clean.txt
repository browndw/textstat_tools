Cars are very portent to a person, we use it for transportation, trailing and more, but it needs lot of money for the petroleum and inshore and not forgetting the cost of the car its self. There for i agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use.
Because of technology other replacements which will provide a better service and shearer cost will be invented or expanded. For example before cars were invented people used to ride houses and camels, as for the footer maybe jet- planes in the ices of car hold be invented.
Another reason for increasing the quantity of cars would be for saving the environment from the potholed are caused by cars, especially the ones that runs by diesel, that is why those ind of cars are not allowed in sermon country like Lebanon for example.
After twenty years i believe that very thing will be provided at home, our work and things we need. So no need for any body to get out of the house and go into their car and drive all the way to go to world or to get something and go back home, because you can simply pick up your phone or get on the internet and order what ever you wish. As a result there will be no reason to buy a car is the first place. After all, why go to something when that thing can come to you?
At least I hope that fewer cars will be used after twenty years for the reasons i mentioned overly. Because I believe that the world would be better of with less cars in the footer, because the environment will be less plotted, and we will get to save time by starting at home, and not driving the car around to go to places.
