Well, i think that the statement has 2 points of view, i i can assure you because of my personal life experience with my actual own business.
The First Point of view.
Like Donald Trump there are many people that take new risk in business (for instance) and start campaign totally different that usually. Donald is a Real State business man, a constructor developer, a golf court owner, and recently a TV host with the Apprentice!
So he try to do the best in many areas, obviously very well researched, because when you have success you learn some rules that teach how to be on top always no matter what, poor example:
A. Think positive.
B. Fail is good, because you learn from it.
C. You always have to be surrounded by people smartest than you, in order to make a team that helps you achieve your goals.
D. You have to serve ALWAYS, because you are a person who works for the people and that people is the one that give you the success.
E. You have to be a visionary or a pioneer, and see what other can't see to help the society grew up.
Well as you see my point of view is like the business side because i like it and i know a lot.
The Second Point of view.
BUT in the other hand, my own experience teach me that if i get lazy and sleeps on my success i can not do new things because i always be waiting the same success from the same source and keep all my risk down, because i "think" I've got the FOREVER formula and try to stay in my status quo.
In summary, i think that the human been that is successful, have to probe him self that he CAN DO IT in other areas different in order to stay alert and grew up in knowledge, perfection and happiness.
Thanks.
