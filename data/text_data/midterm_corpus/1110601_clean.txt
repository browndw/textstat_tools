L am inclined to believe that young people enjoy life than older people because l think young people are the most energetic and healthy than older people.
Firstly, l convince that young people could made a lot of things to love life. For example l can go somewhere where l want. L could go to Christmas parties or clubs and l could go to Paris only Valentine Day. But older people, for example my ground mother could not go such as this places owning to the fact that she is tired or she possesses healthy problems.
Secondly, young people more hopefully than older people. L definitely believe that having this hope improve young people to love life than older people. Significantly young people have time and hope to finish university or find a good job and marry a good people. However all older people almost made this life experiment and they wait to die. For instance, l want to find a good job and than become a product manager or l desire to find a handsome boy to marry or take a new car. But my father have already done this things and he only wants to live healthy life.
Thirdly, l am inclined to believe that older people sometimes a lot of healthy issues and this effected their life view point. For example my ground father possesses a lot of crucial healthy problems and this makes him disappointed about enjoying life. Actually l think he only wishes to die. Sometimes l go to cinema with him but his hearth starts to beating fast and we are going back to home sadly.
As a result of that l am inclined to believe that young people have a lot of time and they are more healthy and hopefully than older people. L think young people spend time fully to go cinema, theater or party. Because when young people become old they do not like life and life only gives them pain like it gives my ground mother or father. Sometimes l want to have a stick with witch and give them chance to love life like me.
