The great majority of cars are using oil to work. But, as everyone knows, oil is more and more difficult to find and expensive to extract, as it is a limited resources. So, as it is said everywhere, it will be necessary to limit our consumption. Then, people's awareness of ecological issues is growing: people are wondering which world they will leave to their children, and try to take measures to curb the trend: that is why, for example, the Tokyo act try to limit pollution. At a smallest level, some European cities try to prevent city centers from being overspent: in some ones cars are banned from the center, in others they are allowed only every twice day...The trend is to make public transport prevailing for daily travels. Such an evolution can bring us to think we will find less cars in twenty years than today.
But things are not so easy. First, ecological care does not concern every countries on earth: it develops itself mostly in "developed countries" which have already have their industrial revolution. Developing country, in particular China, have other priorities than ecology and economy of resources: they want to develop themselves, to challenge Western countries. And to achieve their goals, they must produce, however it spoil or not. In the same time, the purchase power in China is increasing, like it did in Europe during the industrial revolution, and massive consolation is coming. And we can expect it will represent a giant market for all car brands. That's why we may so think that we will find more car on earth in twenty years.
The best thing would be that car sells develop, but that we also develop new technology make them.
