In my opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects. I believe this, because with a broad knowledge it is easier to work in a team and you are able to fulfill many different tasks.
When working in a team, you have to communicate with your team members and understand what they are talking about. Because a team does not consist of people who are all specialized in the same specific subject, it is necessary to be able to talk to all of them about their problems. But to understand and solve these problems you have to have knowledge of other academic subjects. For example a team in a company works on the development of a new product.
This team will at least consist of one person who figures out, how to sell the new product best and another one will do the technical part and invent new technicians. But if the first one does not understand what is possible to produce, his ideas won't be possible to build. The other one does not understand how the product has to be build to be sold very good. His new technicians may be excellent, but they won't be able to sell to the consumers. Because of this, the team will not be able to achieve good results, because everyone does only have knowledge of one specific subject.
The second important reason is, that you won't work on tasks in one specific subject all the time. When a task is finished there might not be another one in the same area available so you have to do something different. After finishing a physical research, instead of doing the next research project, you might have to explain the results to other people and help them to implement your results into new products.
Both situations show, that a broad knowledge of more than one specific subject is very important when it comes to team work or changing responsibilities.
