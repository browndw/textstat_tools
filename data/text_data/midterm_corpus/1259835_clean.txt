Developing a broad knowledge base on numerous academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject implies acquiring knowledge for the purpose of striving for quantity rather than quality. In my opinion, broad knowledge complements or rather acts as a foundation of specialization rather than being more favorable than specialize in one specific subject.
Broad knowledge of many academic subjects have been emphasized during our early years of education since it provides students a basis or tool to raise awareness to things occurring round them and a backbone to further develop their knowledge database.
It also acts as an appetizer for people to explore different areas of knowledge and discover one that they are willing to dwell deeper into. In addition, it secures a certain level of literacy among the population since people have sufficient knowledge to handle daily matters.
However, knowledge is about gaining in depth rather than having a broad yet shallow base. Broad knowledge is similar to information which is easily lost and can hardly sustain. It is by specialization in one specific subject that knowledge can be thoroughly researched, experimented, evolution and make a difference to the world we live in.
Civilizations take huge strides forward due to the innovation of pioneers who are specialists of their respective subjects. Multinational pharmaceutical invest billions in research and development to sponsor laboratory experiments in developing new medicine that can treat diseases such as AIDS and malaria. Lives are saved by the specialists' efforts which can not be substituted by people having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Laws and constitutions which act as one of the four pillars of a society is established by lawyers who are also specialists.
Possessing a wide breadth of knowledge is appreciated as it supports the development of specializing a specific subject which can bring paramount improvements to the world we are living in.
