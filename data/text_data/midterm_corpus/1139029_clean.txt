Technology is in a fast progress. Since the invention of the televisions , people have been spending much more time in front of them. As a result, the researchers find out that advertising the products on tbs or on billboards will catch so many people's eyes. But i, personally don't believe the general idea of the community. I don't think the better the product is advertised, the better it is. I want to share my experiences.
About a year or a year and a half ago, i bought a set of knives from a television ad, assuming that they are better than my regular knives. Although, they were being advertised like even having the ability to cut a wood, it was a total disappointment when i got them. They were not even different from my old knives, and supposed to do the same job. After all, i began to use them in any case and after 6 months or so, they began to not to be trenchant and had to throw all of them away. They neither cut a piece of wood, nor a tomato at the end.
My second experience is about believing or assuming the ad products were better was about a doll for my cousin. She wanted the toy , that was sold in a store, and also advertised on the tbs. As a matter of fact i bought the toy to her and it had broken in few days, while she was playing with it.
As a conclusion, however, in the past i used to believe that the advertisements make the product better,I learned that it is not a statement, applying to every case. After all these experiences, I learned to critics more about the stuff that i am going to buy, and not pay attention to the advertisements. They are not that useful, as they are shown.
