Generally speaking, I agree with the statement. In my opinion it has gotten harder for young people to get involved in community activity.
It is true that less an less young people participate in activities of their communities, but there are reasons to do so.
First of all, I think that the expectations of a young person's environment, especially parents and teachers, are very high nowadays. It is expected from a young person to earn good grades at school or at college, to participate in extra curricular activities to show a wide range of interest and many young people have to work after school to earn their spending money. There is not much time left to engage socially.
Besides, in our society young people are told everywhere to have fun rather than being socially engaged. This raises young people's expectations as well. But I believe, that most young people cannot be held responsible for wanting to live like they are told to by the media and their environment. In other cultures young people do not experience the same kind of freedom young people in the USA have. Often they are told to take care of family members or friends, which is a social engagement as well. In the western civilization the family structures and social connections have been weakened over the last decades, which might also be a reason for decreasing interest in social work.
So the problem of the declining number of young people who give time to help their community is overall a societal problem, that has to be dealt with, because there is still a necessity to encourage young people to engage socially.
Communist often depend on people, especially young ones, who are not paid for the work they do. Moreover, it can be a lot of fun, being an active part of a community. It is always a way to meet a lot of people who share your interests and it can be very inspiring to work with elderly people, for example.
Young people can learn a lot from them.
