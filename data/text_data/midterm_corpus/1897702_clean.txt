MORE CARS
Cars are one of the most effective and useful innovations in our life.Cars can help to reach quickly wherever we go.When I was a child I really excited to see lots of cars around us.In my opinion, there will be more cars than there are today because of some reasons.
To begin,Technology has developing for every minutes.Companies produce lots of new things to help people,to make easier our life.For example, everything has changed since I was born.This is the small part I can see because I have been just living for 18 years.As an example, clothes, music and cars changed.Cars companies continue made cars in every style in every model.So people want to use or have new car, new style.In 90's Mercedes was really famous in our country but now Rhonda's more popular.As you see It's chancing.
In addition, population has growing up it never stopped and won't.In every minute lots of children born when you think population you can understand that some facilities have to ready for future generations.Especially cars..People need to more cars because of population.For instance;in my hometown there were 2 million cars in 1988 but now there 5 million cars.Cars are like skyrockets in twenty those years.As i write; population is the one of the most effective reason that believe increasing cars population.
Finally;We love to feel good with our house; salary or car.We want others good expressions.Just want to feel proud ourselves can increasing tech cars population.For example,I want to cars definitely old cars like many people.I collect and spend my money for them for new and old cars.Mercedes,Golf's etc..If I have money I don't worry cars population I just buy and use car my cars.
Summary;Cars population will soar with people population and.
Another reasons.I believe there will be modern; variety and useful cars but I really don't know It will be good or bad for pedestrians.
