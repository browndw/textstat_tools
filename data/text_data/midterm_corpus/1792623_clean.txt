Everything in life had to go new ways at one point. Evolution for example. Without going new ways, humans maybe would still live in caves if they existed at all! To connect this example with today life, you only have to look at famous people like Bill Gates for instance. He tried new things, and today he is one of the most famous people in the world, pushed the technology a huge step forward and owns up to that more money than I could ever count.
Of course, on the one hand I have to say, that you are on the safer side of life if you only do the things you know you can do. Because you are self- confident in what you do, and you will do it the correct way without having to worry about not solving a problem perfectly, for example given by your boss at work.
But on the other hand everyone wants to improve and be 'as good as can be', and that is not possible without moving on. A good example is a tennis player. If he would never change his way of playing, everyone would know how to beat him, and he could quit his tennis career. That's why he is trying to learn new techniques. And this was only one example. Another one could be, that he gets bored of playing and feels unsatisfied his whole life through.
In every part of life it is the same. You want to improve, so you have to accept the fact, that you have to try and learn new things.
So I do agree with this statement that "successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what the already know how to do well". Because mankind wants to move on - that in its nature. And you can only move on if you try new things.
