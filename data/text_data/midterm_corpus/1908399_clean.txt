I strongly disagree with the statement that there would be fewer cars in use twenty years from now.
"Necessity is the mother of invention",the necessity to travel faster, better has lead to the invention of the motor car. Ever since their invention cars have been modified and upgraded gradually. What that was considered a status symbol has grown in to an essential requirement with time.
Cars have gradually revolutions the mode of travel and thus lured people in to investing in buying cars like never before. The number of cars have increased dramatically due to the decrease in costs and the various offers that a company has to offer to the buyer.
The sense of competition among the many car manufacturers has brought in a culture where people get to buy cars at a very low rate or also buy in an installment method thus increasing the number of customers.
The increase in population also leads to the increase in the number of customers buying cars and also the industrial revolution and the increase in the per capita income coupled with the various offers given by the car companies increase the number of cars being brought by the common man.
A sense of comfort and pride has lead to the greater buying of cars by the common man.
Initially, there were only a few companies that manufactured cars and the transport of the manufactured cars also was a tedious process and the whole thing was a costly affair but with the advent of more and more car companies and the easier mode of transport of manufactured cars the number of cars brought has become higher and this number is increasing.
At the initial stages there were only a few cars to be seen but as time progressed there were many varieties of cars and the number of them also increased tremendously. There is no reason why this number would decrease in the years to come as the population is always increasing so are the number of cars being manufactured and sold.
