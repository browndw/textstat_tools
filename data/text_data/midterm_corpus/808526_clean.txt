I don't believe that group tour led by a tour guide is a good way to travel in that traveling in a group will reduce the opportunity of experiencing new culture and is far more expensive than traveling alone.
First, when people travel, people usually expect to experience new things including meeting new people and new culture. While traveling alone, people can be easily exposed to new culture and adventures. However, when people travel in a group led by a tour guide, people should follow the tour guide's decision on many matters and will have less opportunities to explore the city by themselves and get new cultural experiences. I remember when I went backpacking to Europe alone, I met so many new people and learn new cultural things by exploring the city by myself. It was a truly fulfilling Experience.
Another reason is that traveling with a tour guide is not cost effective. The cost of hiring a guide is already included in the price you have to pay to the travel agency and the price is often far more expensive than the money you might need when you plan to travel by yourself.
Of course, there're some advantages we can have when hiring a tour guide. The tour guide can provide better security in a foreign country and useful local information such as bargaining tips and local history. However, compared to those benefits that we can obtain from the a tour guide, the price for hiring a tour guide is too expensive in many cases. With the same amount of money paid for a tour guide, people can visit more places in a longer period if they want or people can save the considerable amount of money by not hiring a tour guide. These days, internets provide all sorts of information. If people prepare their trip ahead of time, they can also learn the same kinds of information that a tour guide provides during the trip.
