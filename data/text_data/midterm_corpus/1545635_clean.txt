In the next future the number of cars in use will probably fall down. These thesis can be proofed with some important facts. Nowadays the cars` number is getting bigger bigger, congestion the road and the city. Move by car in a big city it`s very difficult because of the traffic, and move by car in a metropolitan like Milan or new york it`s nowadays almost impossible. In addition to this direct mobility problem, the pollution provided by the elevated number of cars it`s starting to cause very serious problem in city living.
Another relevant problem connected to growing cars` number is the raise of petroleum price, that makes fuel the car more and more expensive.
To fight this problem many cities are trying to promote the public transport use, to reduce pollution in city area provided by car.
To improve the dismissing of the car in many town especially historical town (like roe and Florence), the acre access to the city center was very restricted to a very little number of people with special permission, in other cases the traffic in the city center was forbidden at all.
Many studies about cars alternative car fuel are in act to reduce pollution provided by them, but the continues growth of city and metropolis, and their overpopulation let see that in a not very far future we`ll not be able to access city by car.
Nowadays Unfortunately the public transport are not so good at work at your own car is, so many people are also prevented to leave their car in benefit of public transport use.
But also in this case many lot of studies and work are in progress to give the people a very good service that can really answer their needs.
In conclusion i agree with the statement, and in twenty years, i think that we`ll must leave our loved and hated car in garage.
