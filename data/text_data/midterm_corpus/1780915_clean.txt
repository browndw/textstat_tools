I think the answers has to be no. Young people do just have a different way to enjoy life and other purposes. Younger people want to get independent and explore life. They need to get experience in order to find the their way of life. A thirteen year old girl for example enjoys to go out with here girlfriend, do something crazy or forbidden, which will help her to get to know the people and things she likes. Young people do also frequently change their opinion about what they actually like and therefore enjoy in life.
Older people have more experience and they do normally know what they like and what not. So in contrary to younger people the enjoying of life is something more consistent for older people. They may just be grateful to be able to sit in a park and watch the doves in order to enjoy life. But this doesn't mean that the old man sitting in the park enjoys this experience less than a thirteen year old smoking a cigarette in her closet.
This leads to another important fact. In my point of few it depends on the personal preferences of the person. The age is hereby irrelevant. So it may even be that the old man from the park has the preferences of a thirteen year old and loves to go to rock concerts.
There is one fact which makes it easier for older people to enjoy life: money. Since most of the older people have a profession and work for money they have more opportunities to enjoy things in life than a student who has to get a long with a view dollars a month. Also by reaching the legal age of 18 (in Germany) there are again more possibilities to enjoy oneself as an adult.
So to sum up: There is no indicator which of the mentioned group enjoy life more than the other. To many factors influence this impression. Although the older people have a straight advantage of having money and a driving lis.
