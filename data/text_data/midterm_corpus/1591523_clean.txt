The ideas and concepts world or the simple fact world. When anybody thinks about what type of education prefer for the young students, he or she asks about what world likes for them and what kind of live crosses.
The life world is divided in two forms of understanding the live, one of them is focused on the facts that the students need to know to be successful, that support all of these activities. On the other hand, the other form is based on the ideas and the concepts that the young students needs to understand for their real development.
The people who think that the principal focused that need to have the school is learn to the students all the facts that occurred in the world because with that, the students could be betters and could be find a job in somewhere and doing something because have the knowledge that permit to do that whatever the student like.
In the opposite, the people who think that the important learned for the students in the schools is to have an criterion and the possibility for distinguish the important idea and relevant concept any activity or intellectual development, prefer that the professors insist in teach about who anybody needs to think and how is that people needs to understand the importance of the ideas.
So the most important question is if one of both concepts is the most important for the development of the students or if the students needs the conjunction of both concepts to find a real development and a real knowledge for the life and for the opportunities of works that he or she find.
I think that the better teacher is a man that teach about the ideas and concepts but that ideas and concepts are explained by the teacher with a real and historical facts because the students learn the concept and never forgot the fact.
