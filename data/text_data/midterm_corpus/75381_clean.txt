Nowadays it became really easy to travel around the world, thus a lot of tour guide propose to travel everywhere for cheaper. For this reason, i think that this market is interesting for some people who prefer to be surrounded but in my opinion i'm still convince that the best way to discover a country or a culture by myself is more interesting and more benefit. They're several reasons which can explain my choice that i'm going to show in this writing.
The discover of a new country is an amazing thing because when you arrived in those countries your are contently surprised by the difference between how people who lives their are and how you live in your country. You meet an other way to live because you're in vacation for the most of time; as result, you couldn't see how is their life really because you're more interesting by sunbath or by the activities offer by the hotels. That is the broadest way i think to take benefit from the country which you visit. I think that you loose much time to stay in your hotel instead of share greats moments to learn about the population and their costumes. In order of this examples i think that to travel in a group led is really lost your time.
The other way to travel and visit a country is to trip by yourself. When you arrived in a country everything is unknown and you have to do like the local population, to use the communal transport, to eat like them and in fact to adopt the same life during your trip. However, some people could be scare to travel alone because they have any ideas about the place or about the rules. But that's why this way to travel is more interesting than a group led because you discover more interesting thing about.
