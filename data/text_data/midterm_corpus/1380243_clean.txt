I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, because today a specialization is more useful than a broad knowledge. However, it depends on the kind of job you want to do; for a children's teacher, for example, perhaps it is better to have a broad knowledge.
If you are specialized in one specific subject, only you and other few people are able to understand this subject in deep, and so some people will look for you and your knowledge. Think about me: I am studying Material Science and Engineering; I haven't a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, but if someone has problems concerning with materials, I am the person for him and I will be payed lots of money for my suggestions. Thus, specializing is a good way to have better chances in finding work.
Otherwise you mustn't be an ignorant in the other subjects, because you are required to know what are you talking about, when you are speaking with another person. For example, if someone speaks to me about gears or engines at work, I have to know how they work properly, more or less. Also if someone ask me an information about an important philosopher like Baruch Spinoza, I am supposed to know something about him.
However, I think that this broad knowledge should been given to students by High Schools, and not by the University. If you have done your High School properly, you are supposed to have enough broad knowledge to support all the discussion you will take in the future.
Thus, in my opinion it is better to attend the High School in a good way in order to achieve a broad knowledge of many subjects, and then specialize in what you like the most when you are going to the University.
