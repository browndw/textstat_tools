Nowadays, a product is for 80% sold thank to the marketing department. This implies that the marketers have to prove and to show ourselves that the product they sell is the best on a certain market. It seems that everybody from the twentieth century must be aware of the great impact that the enterprises have on our shopping.
It is totally right that the firm will try to transmit a message through its product in order to reach our desires and our needs. They put their whole resources in the communication, everything leans on it.
Knowing this, the customers should be able to distinguish the reality from the dream. The enterprises use the nativity and the innocence of some people a lot.
In consequence, this is our role as consumers to know that an advertisements does not reflect the real qualities of a product. Everything is based on the image the firm wants to show.
For example, a toy for kids will always seem better than it really is. Mostly because the children will want to see it like that and to be attracted to it. It is exactly the same thing for a target market like the aged persons. The entire society is condition to be - or at least to seem - perfect and beautiful until no age. The enterprises know that and use this influence a lot to sell their product.
As a conclusion, it is hard to define either advertisements are more or less representative of the reality. It is sure though, that the objective of an enterprise is to make the consumers believe that their product will give them beauty, health or anything they are trying to find. Moreover, it depends on the personality of the buyers because they won't have to buy the product. They will take the final decision. In other words, it is up to us, consumers.
