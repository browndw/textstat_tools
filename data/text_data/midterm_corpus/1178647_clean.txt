I agree about this topic. I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If we didn't go to primary school and we didn't understand how we make a sentence with words we can't learn writing and reading. So I think understanding ideas is important.
For instance suppose that you have a computer but you didn't use it. Before you use it, you must learn it is using. So firstly you should understand it is using.
Another example is that If you want to take TOEFL you should take a course about this exam, you should understand all ideas about this exam. After this preparing you can take this exam.
In two examples Which were given above; If you contact with an experiment you can be more successful. So I think If you want to be a successful person you should ask questions to another people who you can trust her \his ideas. Because I think intelligent people use his\ her mind but more intelligent people use another people's mind not to make mistake. To become more successful in a short time you should ask other's ideas about your situations.
In addition that understand all details about facts you can imagine what it will be go on? As a matter of fact that you can always ask questions about your situations and understand all ideas and concepts and you can go right.If you can't understand ideas you may not improve easily and in a short time. So it is an important part of life to understand ideas.
To sum up When you want to learn facts you search every sides of it. Don't forget that every person have different ideas and different looking sides. So you always learn other's ideas from them or from books, than think them and solve the facts.
