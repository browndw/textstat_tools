I don't agree with "Jack of all traits and master of none"
I personally feel its better to expertise in a single field rather than trying to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects since, it will lead us no where.
Firstly, It would be a difficult task for the students to throw light on every subject they learn as a part of their academic curriculum.Instead of this, students can concentrate on a single subject and try to learn more of it.This will help the student to learn a subject with more interest and also gives a chance for the student to choose the subject they wish to expertise.
But in the case if the student tries to have a broad knowledge of all subjects one day he will be confused about himself. Therefore, its more advisable to master in a particular area of the students interest.
To have a clear illustration of this let us consider a real time example. If we consider two students, among which one has a broad knowledge in all the academics and the other is a specialist in hardware engineering. If these two apply for a particular job say, for the post of a hardware engineer than the former student will have a few chances for acquiring the job since he has no profound knowledge in that particular area but, he just has an overview of it.
And therefore the other student will be consider for the job.
Not only in the case of employment but also in real life, the one who has deep knowledge of his specific subject could survive any where in this competitive market. And by expertise more in a single field he will get a very good insight about his subject and he will be capable of fetching good rewards and fame in his area of study.
Therefore it is always advisable to master in a particular field.
