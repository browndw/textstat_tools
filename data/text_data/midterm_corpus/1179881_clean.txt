In my point of view, I can not agree with statement ; young people enjoy life more than older people do.
Because, I think, order people have experience, knowledge and shape of life.
Young people almost think that they can any thing and they can break some situations with young power.
But it is not true, ma be. All need is, in my opinion, experience.
When we solve some problem, we will call back own experience.
And if we got a same situation before, we could find solution form experience.
Older people have lots of experience, because they lived long time than young people.So older people could find solution soon.
Less problem makes enjoy life.
Second,Older people have many kind of knowledge.
Thus, older people can understand the almost things.
And they can share these knowledge with his sun or other people.
He can teach something.
It is so eliciting and enjoyable thing.
In the other hand, young people can not this sharing.
Because they are so young and they have not enough knowledge to teach for another person.
Finally, older people have shape of life.
It means they can find a answer; who am i and what is destination of life.In longtime, we away search some answer; who i am or what should do in my life.
In that situation, we have no time for enjoy life.we always should keep thinking or searching.
Order people, however, will some answer about this question from enough experiences or knowledge.
So they can not hurry in their life and they can enjoy his lest of life.
All in all,Seemingly , you people have lot of time and they can enjoy their life more, But , in fact, older people can more enjoy than young people.Because they have experience, knowledge and shape of life.
