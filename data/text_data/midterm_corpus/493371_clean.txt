A more common and well accepted saying is "It's better to be a master of one trade than be a jack of all". Being a person who would like to specialize in the field of Wireless Telecommunications, I disagree to the statement "It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject", as against what the current world is demanding.
Most of the human being is talented in one specific skill. So he can concentrate and outperform well on a subject or topic that he has chosen depending on this skill. Also his performance will be better when he works on this liking subject or topic. For example, a person who likes singing can contribute better if he specializes on Music, as compared to his performance in other subjects.
Speaking about academics, a person specializes on a subject which he likes the most. He chooses that subject in which he feels he can contribute more. Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, can certainly to one extend, help a person. It will help him to have a wider aspect of thinking. For example, knowledge of mathematics will certainly help a person specializing in Physics.
But at the end of the day, it is what he contributes to the society that matters most. For example, Albert Einstein, famous for his theory on relativity, concentrated in improving his knowledge in a specific subject physics, as against scratching his head in different sciences available during that era. He was able to contribute a lot in the field of Physics, though he was poor in mathematics.
So I would like to summarize that, having a broad knowledge on different academic subjects will surely help a student, but specializing in a specific subject will help him to master it and in turn will help him to contribute back in that field. Thus contributing to the society, more than to himself.
