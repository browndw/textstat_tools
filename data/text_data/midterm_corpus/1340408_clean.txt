The question is being asked if the ideas and concepts are more important for the students than learning facts. This is very important issue about the education because the students have to know every thing about the life and the world from their schools and teachers and their educational books,I think the education is kind of curiosity that has to give the students all what they need .
In my opinion, that the schools as well as the parents have to give the students the opportunity to learn every thing in this world by its facts and the ideas and the concepts , because some times if you don't have any information about the real fact you can't get to any point of the concept that you looking for .for instance what was thinking about the Earth that is revolve around the sun. If this issue is not able to be learn at school , no one can imagine how things can revolve around each other by gravity.
Additionally, teaching fact to the students let them ask more questions about that issue may lead them to understand and may lead them to figure out more concepts in the entire world , like if the students been taught that, not just because you see the entire scene in front of you flat that mean the Earth is flat. The earth is round not flat. And what you just seen is according the angle of your scene. So these facts will be in the mind of the students and will never forget it period , and the students will think with similar issue that makes that ideas or concept in the bottom of their minds and hearts.
In conclusion, I mentioned points that seem to be important to the students to understand ideas and concepts as well as the learn the facts in order to know every thing about the world that we live in.
