When we are old can we say that all the joy of the life is lost easily? Can we say that nothing can make us happy and make us to feel the beauty of life? Of course not; in every part of our life time we can find a beauty to be happy. It is important to feel happy, not to feel upset for the time that past. So, older people can enjoy their life, because of their pasts and their remaining.
Older people can recognize the beauties so easily than the younger people. At the young ages, our life is more passing within a rush and hurry and because of this reason we can't see the clear details of life that can make us happy. Sudden desires makes us more satisfied. Hence the older people spend more time on earth, they can understand the long term changes more easily. For example the growing of a flower, changes on earth; like seasons, like sunsets etc.
As an other idea, i can say that older people have more stable friendships than the younger people have. They have more strong connections between their friends and these friendships satisfy them more. Talking with an old friend about the past and good days, spending time with them can make them happy easily.
On the other hand, older people have so much good memories about the past. By remembering them, they can enjoy the life more easily. Younger people are all on the start point of life and much of them does not have enough good memories about their past, because all their of short life period past in a hurry and with complex thoughts about the future.
As a conclusion, to get older in age does not mean to be older in emotions. Besides, after the fast times of our younger days, the real beauty can more easily recognized. It needs patience to be old and this patience helps old people to understand the meaning of life.
