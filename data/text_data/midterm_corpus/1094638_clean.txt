Travel around the world is a great activity, there are so much to admire and learn. People can travel for pleasure to exotic places like: Hawaii or Bermuda or can travel looking for culture, like: Egypt or Japan. Usually couples go this places looking for relax.
If people travel for pleasure does not need a tour guide, because usually for this kind of travel, travel agencies offer packages with all the activities. This activities are for relax and fun. You do not need a guide for that. However, if you are planning to go Egypt for example, you will need a tour guide.
A tour guide is a person who knows about the area and most important knows about history.
When people travel "time" is very important, so you need to see and learn as much as you can is less time.Therefore, a tour guide is the right person to accomplished this goal.
A tour guide not only knows about history and important places, but also good restaurants, places to have fun and places to avoid because of the security.
I remember when I went to Mexico, my friends and I went to visit some ruins and we hired a tour guide. While we were on the bus going to this City "El Carmen" the tour guide star explaining and taking about this ruins, by the time we got there we knew what to expect.
I will like to go in the future to Egypt with a group of friends and we will definitely be led by a tour guide. There is so much to see in Egypt that I do not want to waste time looking for places or get lost, when we can hire somebody that can take us directly to the best places.
