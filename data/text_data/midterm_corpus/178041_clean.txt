Today there are a lot of services for the people, for travel, for study, for having a better environment, for every thing to simplify the life and enjoy the people.
There are so many solutions for every things, many things for give a better life to everyone.
A great part of these solutions are dedicated to enjoy people: every kind of transport like car, train, plan, or every kind of place to go like disco, pub, swim pools or fitness center.
All to we enjoy..
But I think that young people today can enjoy better than older people did.
I'm a young woman that lived in a time where all I would have or do I could have or do, but I also lived in a small town, where there are not so much service than in bigger city, but i don't think it's a bad thing.
I had the possibility to live in the nature, walk, play, study and feel me good and happy for the small things and, above all, I had no kind of stress like the older people did.
Now, that I live in a bigger city than mine, I'm often stressed and nervous for every things I do or think. It is not only a my problem, every day I see around me people that feels like me.
They try to make something for resolve this problem this why they go out often to go to fitness center, in the night to the disco or to cinema to watch, often, some stupid films that, they hope, can give them a pause in their stressed life.
I also think that a lot of things that we do today for enjoy are not so simple and natural like we would, and there are created so much services to try to resolve this great problem of our society..
We are not more able to enjoy like ours parents.
That's why today more often.
