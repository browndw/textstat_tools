Personally, I think that the real big opportunities are the ones that aren't discovered yet. In other words, to feel the real success, one must go for the unknown, which all the successful inventors and discoverers basically do in common. In the decision step of what to do, one can fall in to a dilemma of whether to do something unsound or to do the proven. This decision is what makes the difference and enables the subject to add the word "the great" after his name.
As long as the gain is considerable, I think that taking risks is not a big deal. That also includes an optimistic vision for the future which, as a matter of fact, everybody should have. This vision will lead anybody inherently to success, so after this vision, the second thing to have in life is a bit of courage to try new things. The history of mankind is full of such examples, like Christopher Coombs or Galileo, who were under extreme pressure because of their beliefs about the fact. Considering today's liberated ideologies, running after "the new" is indeed provoked by almost every authority.
Another concern about what to choose for life is the purpose of life in ones point of view. When the primary purpose is only the money and material, there are many "ready to cook" opportunities to follow, which will make one pretty rich only with some effort, provided that it's based on something he/she already good at. But, in contrary, is one is after his/ her "spiritual" success, then it's the ideals that 's to be chased for.
After all, a quote from the Holy Bible summarizes it all:"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also".
