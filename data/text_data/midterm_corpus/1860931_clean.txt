Can somebody know everything in the world ? Of course no. So why do we try know everything. If you think i have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. It means you do not know anything. Because one person can not know everything , you just know something about everything and it does not work in the academic world. But if you specialize in one specific subject , it means you can know a lot of thing on this subject. Therefore it is better to have specialize just one subject .
I will give an example from the real world. Why companies have a lot of section and their own manager ? Because they are specialist in their section. The owner of the company has a opinion for everything but he can not know everything so he has to ask somebody , who is specialist on this situation ,
What he should do. We can use this information for academic world. If you work on a lot of subjects , you can not spent enough time for every subject. You can not know everything for every subject so nobody will ask you some help for their work because you do not have enough knowledge for them. They need specific answer .
For example you are studying material science and engineering. You can not know everything about every materials. You can just know all material behavior and some other basic things. So nobody ask you something about it because they can find this knowledge everywhere. But if you are specialist on the cast iron , it means you know everything about cast iron. Therefore if somebody needs some help about cast iron they will ask you .
As you can see , you can not know everything for many academic subject. It is better to know everything about nothing. We should spent our time for specific subject .
