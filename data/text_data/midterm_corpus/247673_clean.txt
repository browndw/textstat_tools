I think the best way to make a trip is along or with my family because when you travel with a group you need one person to led every group.
And if you do not have this person and every one want be the person who led is a big problem.
I like travel alone and meet a lot of places in the world make my trips whit my family is good to because i am the person who led them and that's no problem for them.
When you are in an airport there a lot of people inside trying leave that city.
And if u are the with a group is verge difficult the ck eking in the airline counter, a lot of passport a ID every want different seats.
Every one ask for the food during the fly.
And the person who led must be know carefully each one.
If one of them will be sick during the fly.
Or have fear,
If you fly or travel wherever you go alone is better you do not.
Will have any problem only your own person.
Other problem when you fly with specific group is this.
Bag's there a lot of bag's and you have to put a target every one write in right way the name of person,
After arrive to the destiny you have to go to immigration with a lot of persons that not good.
After that you have to go to check your bag.
I fly with my music group and ever family of one of us to London the last year.
Was a big trouble with kids a was a big group, after that experience i fly along or with my family may wife and my child no more.
The only way without problems to fly in a group is if u have your own airplane. But the other way will be a big problem.
