Nowadays people are talking about a broad range of controversial topics. One of these topics is big amount of cars that are used in the world. Some people belie that within twenty years the number of cars must be reduced a lot. However there are just as many people who don't agree and say that there will be a growing in the quantity of cars used in the world. Both of the groups have several reasons to argument their opinion.
One the one hand those who believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than nowadays, say that the governments of the different countries must set restrictions in the use of cars to stop contamination problems caused by the combustion gases, such as acid rain or the growing of the hole in the ozone layer. Also many people want to prevent cars coming into the city center in order to make the cities more comfortable to their citizens as well as to avoid traffic jams.
On the other hand there are people who strongly feel against the reduction in the number of cars that will be in use in the future. Their main reason to say this is that the car is quicker than the public transports therefore it allows people to save time in their moving. Furthermore the high prize of the tickets for the bus or the underground don't help leaving the car at home.
To sum up the topic of the number of cars in use in the future will remain controversial. While some people maintain that in twenty years the number of cars in use will be smaller, you can find just as many people who think that this number must even grow. In my opinion, unless we discover any kind of non- contaminating car, we should restrict the use of vehicles to preserve our planet in good conditions.
