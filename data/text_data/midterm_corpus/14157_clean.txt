Do young people enjoy life more than older people do? This question is a very common one, and a lot of people agree with this sentence. Why young people are supposed to enjoy life more than the older do? Can't people enjoy life at any age?
First, we you see a baby, he doesn't seem to have problems, the only reason a baby is sad is when he is hungry, and you can see on his face when he is happy or not. Then, he ust enjoys life. There is no wars, no economic depressions in his brain yet. Therefore, in that case young people enjoy more life than the others.
Moreover, when you are young, you are less afraid than the others by life. Young people can put their life at risk, by doing extreme sports or by having a risky life. When they do dangerous activities such as drinking a lot, jumping a big gap with a motorcycle, or doing a back flip in snowboarding, young people say that they enjoy life more than the others, as the others wouldn't have done those activities as considered too dangerous. Young people are less afraid of death than older people do. I still agree with the statement in that case.
However, there are many ways of enjoying life. You fortunately don't have to do base jumping to enjoy your life! In fact, you can have for example good times with friends or with your family. You can share some very pleasant moment with your husband or wife at any age! When I see my grand- parents, I know for sure that they enjoy life even if they are about eighty. They still travel a lot and have great experiences in foreign countries.
Finally, I think that you can enjoy your life at any age. It only depends on the way you live, and the way you are.
