I believe that every stage of life has its purpose. As the saying goes, 'there's a time for everything'. A time to enjoy being young and a time to enjoy being old. Surely, I can relate to the feeling of missing the younger years. Those times seemed to have been better than the now. When we are young we are usually happier, but, sadly, that is caused by ignorance and a lack of responsibility. For example, people who are around 20 years old could seem to be happier than people over 30, but that doesn't mean that there are no complications in the younger way of life. When people are over 30 they are very likely to have been through the challenges in life that define a person and make him or her to be called an adult. Also, It could be very stressing to be an adolescent or even a kid, with all of those things that you need to survive to be able to call yourself a grown man or a woman.
Older people seem to be less fun I suppose. But that is not the rule. There's no need for us to expect that every grown up is boring and not funny. I believe that if people can find a way not to lose that spark they had when they were younger it could be a fun way of living for sure. I can see that life could become more and more enjoyable as we grow up, and I bet that it is going to stay that way as my yet young life spans into the future.
Furthermore, I can recall being a kid and wishing to be smarter and more mature, I wanted to be able to understand life and the way things are in the world. And that vision can only be achieved through experience.
In conclusion, I would say that I prefer to be old and wise than to be young and silly.
