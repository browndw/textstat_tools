I agree with this statement. I think that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do for many reasons.
The old people have to think some problems that the young people have not to think. For example, a old person has to think at his or her work and his or her family. When a person has got a family he or she has to think his children but the children has not to think anything because there are their parents that they think for them.
I am 23 years and I know the difference between I was 10 years and I am 23 years. Now, I have to think many things that I had not to think when I was 10 years. Now, I live alone and I have to do all the things that I did not do. For example, now I have to cooking because there is not anything to do that for me. In addition, I have to buy my food and wash my clothes.
In the other hand, when I was a young child I thought to play with a friends of mine. I liked to play football and I played football with my friend for many hour each day. In addition, I went to swimming pool with my friends and I stayed there all the afternoon. In the swimming pool I played volleyball with a friends of mine and we were very happy.
Now, I can not do that I did when I was young because now, I have to go to work and I have not enough time to play football and to go to swimming pool.
At the end, I agree with the statement above because when I was young I enjoyed life more than I do now. I think that the young age is the most beautiful period of life that a person can live and I am sure that there are many other people that think this.
