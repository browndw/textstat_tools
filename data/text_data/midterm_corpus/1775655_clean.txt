Today, the television, the so-called TV, is constantly dropping on us bombs of advertisements in an infinite number and often the relation between the product exposed and his real qualities is broken, like in advertisements with diet systems, fantastic lotteries or toys, and all that is done in order to sell the more as possible.
The most clear example of the statement are the advertisements of diet systems: they are exposed like some kind of miraculous thing that, while we are continuing to live our life, can make us lose a lot of weight without any physical effort, and often they have no effects or collateral effects on the users, attracted by an easy way to improve herself.
Another fake thing are the advertisements where we can easily win something special like a car, a travel or a lot of money by apparently doing something with a less greater importance, like buy some books or a certain number of a determinate object. Then we can discover that it`s quite impossible for us to win that fantastic thing that we wanted, or that this thing isn`t really so great as we can expect.
But the most attacked targets are the children; thousands of toys or games advertisements are daily transmitted from our television, and they reach directly the imagination of the child that is watching them. Often this toys do on the screen a lots of things that they can`t really do, and this thing is "casually" specified with some very, very little phrases transmitted in a quite invisible way near the border of the television screen, so that a child can`t read or even notice them.
In conclusion, is absolutely true that a lot of advertisements about products, like these described, makes these products something incredible, unbelievable, fantastic, and often they are really much worse of what we can see and think but, as a result, they make us lose a lot of money in a useless way.
