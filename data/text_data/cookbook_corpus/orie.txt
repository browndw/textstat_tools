THE ORIENTAL COOK BOOK A Few Important Notes In the preparation of Oriental dishes, stock or broth is used extensively instead of plain water. This practice, however, does not involve any special effort or expense because the materials used for this purpose are trimmings of meat or poultry bones, and the like, not fat, nor any other foreign substances, except uncooked vegetables. The making of stock is very simple, as it only consists in boiling the above mentioned materials in plain water. It is unnecessary to say that before using this broth for any purpose it should be strained through a fine metal sieve. THE KINDS OF MEAT USED: In Oriental cookery lamb is the principal meat used, with which most of the Kebabs, the Basdis and the Dolmas are very delicately made. Still, good beef, veal and mutton often serve the purpose. However, it is better that the question of the meat should be left entirely to the judgment and liking of those for whom the food is prepared. PREPARATION OF DRESSINGS, ETC.: There are certain Dressings --Terbieh--which are exclusively Oriental. These Dressings consist of the following ingredients and are used with: 1.-- Certain Boiled Dishes, Soups, Etc. Dressing is made with the juice of lemon and beaten egg (the preparation of either or both can be increased according to taste and requirement), and is used by pouring the combination of both over the whole food, after blending the mixture with a little portion of the boiled cooking. 2.-- Certain Soups, Etc. Dressing is made with overheated butter and chopped dry onion or crumbs of bread, with pepper shaken over. This mixture, after good frying, is poured into the food and stirred. 3.-- Boiled Head and Shin of Lamb, Mutton, Veal and Beef. Dressing is made with the juice of garlic, vinegar and beaten eggs, and is used by pouring over the whole food, after blending the mixture with a little portion of the cooking. 4.--Certain Boiled Dry Beans, Broiled Fish, Broiled Meat, Etc. Piaz, a mixture of finely cut dry onions (or green onions in season) crushed with salt, then washed, and then mixed with finely cut parsley, is used as garnishing. 5.-- Meats, Fishes, Oysters, Etc., also with Salads. Mayonnaise is made of very finely cut and pressed parsley, olive oil, the juice of a lemon and the yolk of egg, also salt and pepper, all well mixed. 6.-- Pastry and Deserts. Sugar syrup is used on most of Oriental pastry and deserts, and is made of sugar simmered in plain water and moderately thickened. SOUPS [TCHORBA.] The basis of all Meat Soup is stock or broth, obtained from the boiling, in plain water, of bones and meat trimmings, or trimmings of fowls. Various dressings and flavorings are also used with certain soups to enrich them. Compared with the various soups of the other countries, the Oriental soups are fewer in number, although the Oriental peoples are considered great soup-eaters. In quality, these soups are very superior, though very simple in their composition and in general appearance. In the making of soups, one can easily determine on the kind wished and use the ingredients accordingly. Thus, rice can be very conveniently replaced by any suitable cereal, barley, macaroni, Italian paste, etc. Soups must be served hot always. PREPARATION OF STOCK OR BROTH. For Soups, Pilafs and Other Dishes. Use always the bones, especially from the leg or aitchbone of Beef, the tail or any other meat trimmings. Wash them once or twice and leave in plain water for one-half hour. Then, after adding to it as much water as the quantity of the meat or bones requires, boil the whole in a large vessel, over a moderate fire, taking the scum off as it boils. During the boiling, cut into it one dry onion, one carrot, one bunch of parsley, a pinch of salt and two or three stalks of celery. After the contents of the vessel come to a boil, place it to one side of the stove fire, and leave it to simmer for three or four hours. This broth should always be strained, when used for soups, and more water can be added to the vessel for secondary purposes, as for the use of Pilafs and other dishes. In extracting broth from fowls for soup, do not use any of the vegetables mentioned above. 1. PLAIN BROTH. Of Meat Chicken or Other Fowls.

PILAFS [PILAF.] The so-called "Turkish Pilaf," in its many varieties, is one of the best known and most popular dishes among the Oriental peoples. It is prepared with broth and rice, or cracked wheat instead. It might be said that Pilaf is plain thick soup, were it not for certain diversities in its composition which make it quite different from ordinary soup. The stock or broth used for Pilafs is either of plain meat or chicken and turkey--it can be of game as well. Dressings of certain kinds and flavors are also used in the making of Pilafs. In the Orient, with frugal people, a Pilaf made of cracked wheat often takes the place of a meal, or acts as the principal dish at a dinner. Pilafs, the rules for making which are given below, may be easily prepared if the directions are carefully and intelligently followed. Like soups, they must always be served hot and eaten either with spoon or fork. 1. PILAF, PLAIN. [PILAF SADEH.] Ingredients: Stock .............................................. 5 cupfuls. Rice ............................................... 2 cupfuls. Butter ...................................... 2 tablespoonfuls. Salt and pepper, to taste.

When nearly done, slow up the fire under the vessel and cover the pilaf with a piece of white muslin under the lid, falling a little over the brim of the vessel in order to prevent the steam falling back into the vessel. After 5 to 10 minutes stir the rice lightly with the aid of a perforated spoon, and put into hot oven until all its moisture is evaporated and the rice remain almost dry. Cracked wheat may be used instead of rice. 2. PILAF, PLAIN. Another Style. [PILAF SADEH.] Ingredients: Stock ............................................... 5 cupfuls.

The vessel then should be placed in a hot oven, uncovered, to cause the remaining water to evaporate. Serve this Pilaf hot, with or without Matzoun over it. 8. SAFFRON PILAF. [ZERDEH PILAF.] The so-called Saffron Pilaf, which is called also the "Wedding Pilaf," because it is invariably made and served during wedding dinners or other great occasions in the Orient, is composed of two parts, the first being the Plain Pilaf (see Pilafs, Style No. 1.), which should be prepared before the second part is attempted. The second part, with the saffron, is prepared with the following ingredients and method: Ingredients: Plain water ........................................ 3 cupfuls. Rice ................................................ 1 cupful. Saffron ............................................ 2 pinches. Rose water ...................................2 tablespoonfuls. Sugar ............................................. 1/2 cupful. Method: Put the washed rice and the water together in a deep vessel and boil over moderate fire until nearly done, then add the sugar, also the saffron (which must have been soaked in the rose water for 24 hours), and mix well. When the rice is well cooked, the Pilaf may be considered done, and so it should be poured over the first plain part of the Pilaf. Serve in a deep plate. If the entire quantity is not to be used at one time, then it is advisable to keep each section of it separate for reheating. The following note appears at the bottom of page 48. * See Special List of Oriental Ingredients. 9. PERSIAN PILAF.

FISH [BALUCK.] In the Orient, the varieties of fish are numerous and possess better flavors than most of their kind in other waters; therefore, they have become an important article of diet, either as a part of certain dishes or by themselves, and are greatly esteemed. The method of preparation adds greatly to the delicacy of all fish food, and we trust we may be permitted to say, with a just and modest pride, that the proper treatment of fish for the table is an Oriental specialty. Besides being used as a more or less nourishing food, certain kinds of fish are also prepared in the Orient as relishes in endless variety. We are glad to give in this book the recipes of the principal dishes of both kinds. Fish must always be fried in olive oil, if there is not a serious reason for doing otherwise, as it will turn an unpleasing color when fried in any other fat. In preparing fish dishes, care should be taken that the fish to be used are strictly fresh. This condition may be known by the following indications: First of all, the redness of the gills--natural redness, not painted--and the brightness of the eyes, may be considered a good guide. Also, fish should be stiff, and the skin not blistered nor loose. Fresh fish are generally moist. One should be careful, however, to see that they have not been rendered so artificially. The eyes of fresh fish are never sunken into the head. A very unpleasant smell may also be considered as an unfavorable sign. As will readily be noticed, the recipes for fish dishes contained in this book require neither large varieties nor very big quantities of them; therefore, it is recommended that small fish always be selected, for it is very often the case that the large fish are old and consequently tough. Therefore, they not only take a longer time to cook, but are also likely to be tasteless, while the small fish are quite on the contrary. BAKED FISH. List of Fish Suitable for Baking.

This done, prepare the tomatoes, thus: Cut each tomato at the top, nearly all the way around, but leaving the top attached to the rest, in order to act as a lid; then dig out the insides with the aid of a pointed knife or a spoon. They should then be stuffed lightly with the mixture, and each stuffed tomato pierced with a fork to enable it to cook thoroughly and quickly. When all tomatoes are stuffed, pack them closely side by side, in a deep, flat pan, covering the top with a little crushed biscuits. After pouring plain water over the whole, nearly up to the top, place in a moderately hot oven until done. LOBSTER [STACOZ.] The Preparation of Lobster For Boiling, Broiling and Other Purposes. First of all, it is better that the lobsters should be secured when alive, and especially those that are active, with the shells clear and of medium size. Then, before placing them in water for boiling, or over a fire, for broiling, see that the claws are well plugged at the joints, with small wooden plugs. Also that the tails are well folded inward over the bellies, to prevent the soft flesh--which is almost in liquid form when the lobster is alive--from being discharged from the shells. It is only by this means that good results are obtained in boiling or broiling lobsters. Without the use of the plugs or of the folding of the tail inward, lobsters will discharge their liquid flesh, leaving the whole shell almost empty. If many of them are to be boiled at one time, it is better to arrange them tightly, side by side, in a deep vessel, set over their turned tails, and pour boiling water on to kill them instantly. Then boil them in the regular way. Lobsters must be put in boiling water head first, and should not be boiled too long, because long boiling will make the flesh harder and thready. Lobsters should also be broiled quickly over a moderate fire. Boiled lobsters turn to a red color, which is quite a sure sign of their being done. For baking and salad purposes, lobsters should first be boiled or broiled and then used, of course, after taking the flesh out of the shells. 1. BOILED LOBSTER WITH MAYONNAISE.

Serve it either by cutting the whole into two parts or by taking the meat out of the shells. Dish out on lettuce and use the following mayonnaise sauce: Mix the olive oil, the juice of the lemons, the yolks of the hard boiled eggs, and the parsley --cut fine--until all are well blended.

Then cover the bottom of a small deep vessel with one-half of the finely crushed crackers, and place the chopped lobster over it. To this add the wine, the juice of the lemons, also the garlic, and over this sift the finely chopped parsley. Season to taste, and after barely covering the whole with plain water and the remaining half of the crushed crackers, bake it in a moderately hot oven until done, the indication of which is the lowering of the water much below the surface of the ingredients. Serve hot. MACARONI [MAKARNA.] Macaroni is not originally an Oriental dish, but it is used there, or rather in large cities of the Orient, quite extensively. Still, this farina ceous preparation is replaced by the Orientals with a preparation of similar character, called Shehri, which is none other than the well-known noodles. The Oriental noodles (Shehri) is composed of pure wheat flour and eggs --(3 to 4 eggs for each pound of flour)--made into a very stiff paste with plain water. This paste is shaped into small cakes, and opened flat with the aid of a roller, into 12 to 15 inches in diameter, one-eighth of an inch or less in thickness. When nearly dry, these are piled 5 to 6 deep and cut with a sharp knife into 2 to 2 1/2 inch lenghts and about one-eighth of an inch wide. When all the dried batter is thus chopped, it is spread over metal trays and dried further in the sun. Later the trays are placed in a hot oven for still more drying, to avoid the least dampness that may have remained. As it is readily seen, this process of making of the Oriental Shehri is quite old-fashioned, and, like most things Oriental, it has been kept unchanged by the slumber of self-seeking pleasure and content for centuries. Nowhere else in the world, it seems, the saying, "Let well enough alone," has had more adherents than in the Orient. The following note appears on the bottom of page 93 in the original text. * See Special List of Oriental Ingredients. 1. BOILED MACARONI.

Chops, however, are broiled only with the aid of gridirons. Kebabs, or broils, being daily used, not because of their common character, but for their much-loved and nutritious qualities, special fire-places and other arrangements are in vogue everywhere in the Orient, either in public cafes or private homes. Broiling in the Orient is generally done over charcoal or wood fire, but coal or gas fire may be used as a substitute if charcoal is wanting. 1. BROILED RABBIT. Sheep or Lamb, Whole.

ROASTS [KEZARTMA.] Like the Broiled meats - Kebab, the Roasts-- Kezartma, are also in great favor in the Orient, and figure much as the principal dish on great occasions, at feasts and dinner parties. They are cooked on a large scale, as often a whole sheep or lamb is either broiled on a spit, or placed in an oven for roasting. As the stove oven system is not general in the Orient, the roasting is mostly done in the bakers' ovens, which, though not a difficult process, is quite an inconvenient task. However, small roasts are successfully done in vessels or in roast-pans. In Occidental homes, where many improvements are in vogue, all inconveniences in cookery are eliminated. 1. STUFFED ROAST TURKEY, OR CHICKEN. [HINDI KEZARTMA.]-TAVOUK. Ingredients: Turkey .............................. 1, fat. Butter ..................... 1 tablespoonful. Lemon .................................... 1. Rice .............................. 1 cupful. Raisins ............... 1/2 cupful, seedless. Pistachio Nuts ...........1/2 cupful, peeled. The liver of the fowl. Salt and pepper, to taste. Method: Clean the turkey properly, as you would for boiling, trim well, tie its legs together, and fill with the following stuffing : Mix the rice, the seedless raisins, the pistachio nuts and the chopped liver of the turkey together with one-half of the butter, season to taste, and stuff the fowl with it. This opening should be sewed up, in order to prevent the stuffing from forcing itself out during the process of roasting.

BOILED DISHES [HASHLAMA.] Boiled Dishes are the most common, and therefore the most popular dishes of the Orient with the class of people that need to practice economy for various reasons. A boiled meat dish is a double dish with an Oriental housewife, because she makes separate use of the meat and the broth. The meat boiled she serves with a little broth, and with the remainder of the latter she either makes a soup by adding some rice or vegetable to it, or cooks a pilaf with it, without much extra cost, material, or time. There is an absolute belief in the Orient in the finer taste of the meat with the bone, and as this belief on the part of the Orientals is not without a fair foundation, it is therefore recommended to all who wish to try the Oriental cooking on an absolute economical basis. 1.

VEGETABLES WITH MEAT BASDI, SILKMEH, GHUEVEDGE. YAHNI OTOURTMA, MOUSSAKKA. KEYMALI, KAPAMA. VEGETABLES cooked with meat are more popular in the Orient than even the boiled dishes, especially during the vegetable season, when they are offered at more economical cost. The Orient is, perhaps, one of the few countries, and the Oriental people one of the few nationalities that use vegetables so extensively and often with meat, butter or olive oil. It is generally believed that the Oriental cooking is spicy, but it will be noticed, in looking over these recipes, that the Oriental cooking is rich in the composition of ingredients and not in condiments. The proportion of ingredients designated in the following recipes of the Basdis are optional, and they may be increased in accordance with requirements. As these Basdis are also made with olive oil instead of meat, it is opportune to mention that the vegetable dishes with meat should always be served when hot, while the vegetable dishes with olive oil are served either hot or cold. 1.

Then clean the artichokes of their outside hard leaves, and after cutting each one of them into four parts, put the whole either in plain water, saturated with the juice of one lemon, or in a milk-thin mixture of water and flour. This prevents the artichokes from getting black. When all ready, put the washed artichokes with the fried meat in an appropriate vessel, season to taste and add the broth until the ingredients are barely covered. The cooking must be started on a strong fire, but before it is well done the fire should be lowered. Dressing made of the juice of the lemon and the beaten eggs should first be blended with part of the broth, and then poured over the entire basdi. Artichokes with meat may be served without dressing, but the latter will immensely enhance the deliciousness. 2. CANNED ARTICHOKE WITH MEAT.

Note.--Many other vegetable dishes may be composed and cooked after the styles described in the preceding recipes, with more or less variations. This matter, however, is left entirely with the cook and her judgment of appropriate ingredients. STUFFED DISHES [DOLMA.] Stuffed Dishes-- Dolma -- that are made either with meat or olive oil are exclusively Oriental. They are as popular as the Boiled Dishes or the Vegetables with Meat, and there is no exclusive Oriental occasion, such as a wedding or other feast, where they do not appear in one way or another. While the stuffing-- Dolma --is comparatively a simple composition, yet it is done in such various ways, and each different style has so individual a flavor that no one tires of this method of cooking. Dolma is a simple, yet a very natural and nutritious food, very easily prepared and cooked. In Occidental cooking it is perhaps the most curious and striking novelty offering something both new and useful as well. Stuffed dishes are somewhat in vogue now in Western countries, but, compared with the Oriental styles, which may well be taken as original, they are mere imitations in quality and in taste. We are very confident that housewives who try the Dolma will have their curiosity soon changed into something that might be called a sense of duty , because when they once find out the intrinsic value of the Dolma as a principal food, they will feel it due to themselves and to their families to repeat it several times a week. We have many positive proofs of such cases. RECIPE FOR STUFFING WITH Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Cucumbers, Vegetable Marrows,Eggplants, Onions, Cabbage, Vine-Leaves and Quinces. THE "DOLMA" MIXTURE. Stuffing --"Dolma"--consists of the following ingredients and their approximate quantities: Meat................... 1 pound, fat and ground, of lamb or mutton. Rice ................... 1/4 pound, well washed. Dry Onions ...... 3 to 4, medium, finely chopped. Parsley ................ 1 bunch, finely chopped. Plain Water ............. 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls. Salt and pepper, to taste. In a large bowl the above should be well mixed together by hand. If there is more stuffing than needed make walnut-sized balls of the remainder and cook with the "Dolma." 1. STUFFED TOMATOES. [DOMATES DOLMA.] Take ten or twelve good and round tomatoes and cut the tops in such a way that these may still remain attached to the whole ones in order to act as lids. Then after digging out each tomato with the aid of either a sharp knife or a spoon, fill lightly with the "Dolma" mixture--as described above. This done, pierce each on the four sides with a fork and arrange tightly side by side, in a deep flat pan. Between the stuffed tomatoes may be put the centers of the tomatoes, which will help to enrich the gravy. Before placing the pan on a slow fire for boiling or in a moderately hot oven for baking, pour one or more cupfuls of broth or plain water over the stuffed tomatoes. Serve hot. Note.--It is common to mix stuffed Tomatoes with Stuffed Green Peppers, when these are cooked together in this style; the flavor of one increases the flavor of the other. 2. STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS. [FRENGH BIBER DOLMA.] Use ten to twelve large and round green peppers, cut the tops and dig out their seedy parts with fingers. Then fill all lightly with the "Dolma" Mixture. This done, pierce each one on the four sides with the point of a knife and arrange them tightly, side by side, in a suitable vessel or a deep flat pan. Cut two or three ripe tomatoes (or 4 to 5 tablespoonfuls of canned tomatoes) and place between the peppers, adding one cupful or more broth (or plain water). Cook it either on a slow fire or in a moderately hot oven. Serve hot. 3. STUFFED CUCUMBERS. [KHIYAR DOLMA.] Pare eight to ten cucumbers of medium size slightly, dig out their seedy parts with the aid of a narrow and pointed knife, stuff with the "Dolma" mixture, and after piercing each one with a fork arrange in a suitable pan, side by side. Add two or three ripe tomatoes, cut into small pieces (or three to four tablespoonfuls of canned tomatoes) and then pour over one cupful or more of broth, or plain water. Cook either on a slow fire or in a moderately hot oven. Dressing-- Terbieh --made of one beaten egg and the juice of one lemon mixed, may be added to the whole, after blending the mixture first with part of the Dolma gravy. Serve hot. 4. STUFFED VEGETABLE MARROWS. [KABAK DOLMA.] The number of the marrows used in making this Dolma is entirely dependent upon their size. These should be cut into three or four pieces--each piece form three to five inches long (see Stuffed Cucumbers, , Style No. 3). Do not omit the dressing made of beaten eggs and the juice of a lemon mixed. 5. STUFFED EGGPLANTS. [PATLIJAN DOLMA.] Do not skin the eggplants, but if they are large cut them into two, roundly. Dig out the seedy parts. Pierce on the four sides and leave in plain water until the stuffing is finished; after stuffing, arrange them in a deep pan, side by side, and cut over them two to three ripe tomatoes (or three to four tablespoonfuls of canned tomatoes). Then pour on one cupful or more broth (or plain water) and cook either on a slow fire or in a moderately hot oven. Serve hot. 6. STUFFED ONIONS. [SOGHAN DOLMA.] Take 12 to 15 large dry onions, skin and cut each on one side--lengthwise--and leave in boiling water for eight or ten minutes, or until they are sufficiently soft to take each wrapping apart without tearing. Then take small portions of the Dolma mixture, enclose and wrap in each fraction of the onions and arrange them, side by side, in a deep vessel, adding over the whole the juice of two or three ripe tomatoes, a pinch of red pepper, also one cupful or more of broth (or plain water). Cook either on a slow fire or in a moderately hot oven. 7. STUFFED CABBAGE. [LAHANA DOLMA--"SARMA."] The cabbage used for stuffing purposes should be smooth and the leaves thin. Of one such cabbage take the leaves apart, very carefully and without tearing, and put in boiling water until they become sufficiently soft. Then cut each leaf into two-inch-wide strips, lengthwise, and at one end of each strip place a small piece of the "Dolma" mixture and wrap in a triangular form and arrange side by side in a deep vessel. If this method of stuffing proves tedious, then simply cut the cabbage leaves into two parts and into each part wrap stuffing the size of the forefinger, and arrange in the vessel. This done, add to it the juice of two or three ripe tomatoes, a pinch of red pepper, also one cupful or more broth (or plain water) sufficient to reach the surface of the Dolma. Cook either on a slow fire or in a moderately hot oven. Serve hot. Note.--To prevent the mingling of the Dolma units with one another, it is advisable to place a plate over them--upside-down--during the process of boiling. When serving take the Dolma out with the aid of a fork. 8. STUFFED VINE LEAVES. [ASMA-YAPRAK DOLMA.] As the vine-leaves used for stuffing purposes are preserved in salty water, it is, therefore, necessary to put them in boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes, then press in order to rid them of the saltiness. This done, take a small portion of the Dolma mixture and wrap it in a leaf. The wrapping may be done in the following manner: Place the stuffing at the stem end, but in the inside of the leaf, and fold both sides in--one overlapping the other--then roll over toward the end of the leaf. Thus, the wrapped Dolma should be arranged, side by side, in a suitable vessel, and covered with broth (or plain water), chopping over it also one stalk of rhubarb (if handy) to give it a desirable sour flavor. Then after pressing it down with a plate to prevent the mingling of the Dolma units, add one cupful or more broth or plain water, boil on a slow fire until the vine-leaves are very tender and edible. Dressing made of two beaten eggs and the juice of one lemon should be poured over, after first blending it with part of the Dolma gravy. Serve hot and take out with the aid of a fork. Note.--Some like Matzoun over it, but if dressing is made, then Matzoun is out of place entirely. 9. STUFFED QUINCES. [IVA DOLMA.] Take six to eight small but round quinces and clean them of their seedy parts. Pierce on the four sides with a sharp-pointed knife, and after stuffing each one with the "Dolma" mixture, arrange side by side, in a suitable deep pan. Boil either on a slow fire or in a moderately hot oven. Dressing made of two beaten eggs and the juice of one lemon should be poured over them, after first blending it with part of the Dolma gravy. Serve hot. OTHER STUFFED DISHES 1. STUFFED OYSTERS WITH OLIVE OIL. [YAGHLI MIDIA DOLMA.] Ingredients: Oysters .......................... 50, with shells.

Finally season with cinnamon, the salt and pepper. When this mixture is sufficiently cold, stuff each oyster shell, which contains the oyster stuck on one side, press together and arrange in a large suitable vessel, side by side. When through, put a heavy plate over the stuffed oysters to prevent mingling. Then place the vessel over a moderate fire for 5 to 10 minutes, after which plain water should be poured in, hardly reaching the surface of the oysters.

In different countries it varies but little, the variation consisting chiefly in the materials to be preserved. The Oriental way of preserving vegetables is old-fashioned, and thus not only original, but also free from adulteration. We therefore give here a few recipes for these pickled vegetables as they are known to the culinary art of the Orient. 1. GREEN OLIVES IN OIL. [YESHIL-ZEYTIN TOURSHOU.] Take the green olives in desired quantity and leave them in vinegar for a few days, then take out and arrange in an earthenware pot into rows three inches thick, covering each row with a layer of thinly sliced lemons. After thus alternately arranging the olive and the sliced lemons, up to the brim of the pot, pour in enough olive oil to reach the surface, and after covering the pot tightly, open for use after two months. 2. MIXED PICKLES. [TURELUE TOURSHOU.] Half fill a jar or a cask with the desired quantity of each of the following, all mixed: Apricots, peaches, pears, apples, unripe grapes (optional), walnuts (with shells), small cucumbers, green red peppers, green peppers, green tomatoes, green beans, green small lemons, small oranges, carrots, small turnips, red radish, celery, onions (peeled), cabbage and small eggplants. Then fill up the rest of the jar with strong vinegar. Cover the top tightly. This Tourshou will be ready for use after three months. 3. PICKLED BEETS. [PANDJAR TOURSHOU.] Wash the beets well, and boil in plain water until nearly done, then take out of its water, cool, pare and slice in suitable thicknesses. Arrange these in a deep pan, meanwhile seasoning with salt. Then peel a few bulbs of garlic (according to the quantity desired), press and mix with the vinegar, then blend with the water left from the boiled beets, and add this to the beets in the pan. The garlic and the vinegar should be used according to one's liking. After twenty-four hours this Tourshou is ready for use. Serve with olive oil. 4. PICKLED CABBAGE. [LAHANA TOURSHOU.] Cut one whole head of cabbage into two-inch-thick slices, and arrange either in earthen or glass jar. Then boil some salt, a few green red peppers, and the inside of one-half of a bread loaf in plain water, and pour it over the cabbage, after it is sufficiently cool. After two days stir the cabbage--upside down--once or twice a day, for eight or ten days, when it will be ready for use. 5. PICKLED GREEN PEPPERS. [BIBER TOURSHOU.] Wash the green peppers, pierce each one with the aid of a fork, and arrange in a jar, meanwhile seasoning the whole with salt. Cover this with vinegar up to the surface. This Tourshou will be ready in a few days. 6. PICKLED GREEN TOMATOES. [DOMATES TOURSHOU.] Treat green tomatoes in like manner as the Green Peppers, according to the directions given in the foregoing recipe, Style No. 5. 7. PICKLED STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS. [DOLMA BIBER TOURSHOU.] Take four or five skinned dry onions, as many green peppers, also as many green tomatoes, and chop all these together very fine. Season with salt and powdered cinnamon. Then take as many green peppers as the stuffing will call for. Cut round their tops about one-half way, take out the seedy parts, and then fill each one with the above chopped mixture. Cover the tops, and after tying each with white string pierce them all lightly with the aid of a fork, and arrange in a glass jar. This done, pour vinegar up to the surface and cover the jar tightly. After eight or ten days this Tourshou will be ready for use. 8. PICKLED STUFFED GREEN TOMATOES. [DOLMA DOMATES TOURSHOU.] Treat green tomatoes in like manner, as the Pickled Stuffed Green Peppers, according to the directions given in the preceding recipe, Style No. 7. 9. PICKLED DRY ONIONS. [SOGHAN TOURSHOU.] Skin the dry onions, in the quantity desired (small varieties preferred), and arrange in a jar, meanwhile seasoning the whole with salt. Then cover it with strong vinegar. Instead of vinegar, boiled, but cooled salty water may conveniently be used. After eight or ten days this Tourshou is ready for use. 10. PICKLED GARLIC. [SARMOUSSAK TOURSHOU.] Treat garlic in like manner as the Pickled Dry Onions, as described in the foregoing Style No. 9, except that the skins of the garlic should not be peeled, and it may be used in whole pieces, without taking the bulbs apart. 11. PICKLED CELERY. [KEREVIZ TOURSHOU.] Wash a few stalks of celery, cut the stalks into two or three-inch-long pieces, season to taste and put in a jar, adding a few bulbs of peeled and pressed garlic. Cover the whole with vinegar and keep the top tight. In a few days it is ready for use. 12. PICKLED EGGPLANTS. [PATIJDJAN TOURSHOU.] Use small eggplants, fifteen to twenty of them. Boil them for eight or ten minutes. Cut in two, but do not separate the halves. Press under weight, to cause the bitter water to be squeezed out. Then take one or two heads of garlic, bulbs peeled, a few green red peppers, one stalk of celery, and chop these fine together, adding some salt and vinegar. With this mixture then fill the openings of the eggplants, and with celery leaves wrap them so that the stuffing may be secure. Arrange these stuffed eggplants in a jar, tightly, and cover with strong vinegar, keeping the top well covered. In a few days this Tourshou will be ready. 13. PICKLED CARROTS. [HAVOUDJ TOURSHOU.] Take as many carrots as needed, and boil them for ten or fifteen minutes, then cut either into long fine pieces, or slice them round into suitable thicknesses. Put in a jar mixed with leaves of celery, season with salt, cover with vinegar up to the surface and keep the top tight. In a few days this will be ready for use. 14. PICKLED CAULIFLOWER. [CARNABIT TOURSHOU.] Treat cauliflower the same as you would Pickled Cabbage, described in the Style No. 4, under this chapter. Note.--Almost any vegetable may be pickled after the plan of the kinds described in the preceding recipes. Fruits, however, differ a little from the vegetables, and they are pickled in Cogniac or Brandy instead of vinegar. Therefore, we give below a recipe for it which will serve for pickling strawberries, sour cherries (with stems), apricots, rose leaves, grapes, etc. 15. PICKLED FRUIT. [YEMISH TOURSHOU.] Take any of the above fruits, in desired quantity, clean, and wash in boiled white wine. Then add Cogniac or Brandy twice its measure. The latter may be blended with some sugar. Cover the jar, in which the pickling is done, with perforated thick paper (plain paper may be perforated with a common pin) and leave the jar in the sun for fifteen days at least. PASTRY [HAMOUR.] CAKES, FRITTERS, PIES AND PUDDINGS. Paklava, Beoregh, Pasta, Helva. The Oriental peoples are great pastry eaters, hence, without Paklava, Beoregh, Pasta or Helva, at a table, an Oriental dinner is never complete. The consumption of such sweetmeats in large quantities is responsible for the statement that for every candy shop elsewhere, there is a pastry store in the Orient. Also more of it is made in every Oriental home than in the homes of other lands. We cannot praise enough the delicacy and the wonderful fine taste of Oriental pastry; neither can we draw a comparison between it and others. It will not be our fault if some housekeepers find them not to their liking, because of incorrect attempts at making them. Still, we believe that if care is taken in the process, the Oriental Hamour will be successful in any kitchen. 1. PLAIN CAKE. "Paklava."

When the Paklava begins to get browned, pour over it some more hot butter and watch closely, until the whole is well done. After this, take the pan out of the oven, and remove two or three of the cakes temporarily, and tilt the pan on one side in order to cause the remaining butter to gather on the lower side, when it should be taken out with the aid of a spoon.

The mixture then should be left in this condition for twenty-four hours, when the other half portion of the two-thirds of the rose water should be added and the whole boiled, until half cooked, when little by little the first one-third portion of the rose water must be placed in the boiling mixture. The preserveis considered done when it gets cream thick; at this point the juice of the lemon should be mixed in, and when sufficiently cool, the preserve may be put in proper jars. 6.

This sugar syrup should be poured in the strained orange juice in the vessel (not the juice into the boiling sugar syrup, as in this case the orange flavor may totally get destroyed), and stir well. Cool this preserve before putting in proper jars. Note.-- Tchevirmeh may be prepared from all kinds of fruit with good flavor and wholesome juice, in like manner as described above.

In this dip the chestnuts, which must first be shucked, roasted and strung. Note.-- Cherries and Sour Cherries can be prepared in same way as the Chestnuts, but without stringing, as the stems will conveniently replace the strings, but strawberries may be strung three or four together. 3. STRAWBERRY JELLY. [TCHILENGH ELMASSIEH.] Ingredients: Strawberries ...............................2 quarts. Sugar ........................................1 pint. Gelatine ....................................1 ounce. Plain Water ................................1 cupful. Method: Press the strawberries and pass through a fine metal sieve.

Meanwhile continue boiling the remaining syrup until it gets much thicker, when it should be poured over the cooked pieces of apple in the plate. Note.-- Pears, Oranges (cut into halves) and Quinces--all skinned and cleaned of their seedy parts; also Prunes, Cherries and Apricots are prepared in the same way as the Apples when desiring to make compotes of them. 5.

This being done, stir the syrup until the gelatine gets well blended with it, and when it is quite cool, add the pineapple juice; if the latter is added when the syrup is hot, the flavor may get destroyed. Before pouring this Elmassieh into a proper bowl, decorate the bottom and the sides of the latter with small pineapple pieces, also with the almonds and the cherries, sticking them with the aid of gelatine, and after the syrup is poured in, pack it well in ice.

Again, crush the strawberries and mix well with the sugar syrup (made of five parts of sugar and one part of water, boiled until reduced to the measure stated in the above list of Ingredients), adding the gelatine also, which must be first melted in a little lukewarm water; freeze this mixture also in an ice cream cooler. When these two preparations are thus separately made ready, put them into a suitable receptacle in such way as to be alternately arranged and be rightly cut into shapes suitable for serving. In order to take the "ice cream" out of its mould easily, dip the bottom of the receptacle in hot water for a minute or so, then turn it upside down in a proper plate.

The fermenting may either be done in the vessel in which the milk was heated, or transferred into other vessels, bowls or cups, when the milk is still hot. When this is done, cover the vessel or the cups with a warm blanket. Other convenient means may appropriately be used to keep the milk warm during the process of fermentation. Two and one-half or three hours later in summer and winter, respectively, the fermentation may be considered done, and the receptacles containing the Matzoun be placed in an ice chest and cooled.
