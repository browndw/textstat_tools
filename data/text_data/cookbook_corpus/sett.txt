THE "SETTLEMENT" COOK BOOK CHAPTER 1. HOUSEHOLD RULES. HOW TO MEASURE. All measurements should be made LEVEL. Accurate measurement is essential to insure good cooking. A half-pint cup is the standard.  They can be had with fourths and thirds indicated. A cupful is a cup filled LEVEL with the top.  To measure a cupful, fill lightly with a spoon, taking care not to shake the cup; then level with the knife. A spoonful is a spoon filled LEVEL with the top.  First sift the material into the bowl, dip in the spoon, lift it slightly heaping, and level it by sliding the side of a knife across the top of the spoon.  Do not level by pressing it. Half a spoonful is obtained by dividing through the middle lengthwise. A speck of anything is what will lie within a space 1/4 inch square.

The principal ways of cooking are boiling, broiling, stewing, roasting, baking, frying, sauteing, braising, fricasseing and steaming. Boiling: Cooking in boiling water.  Boiling point, 212° F. Broiling: Cooking over a glowing fire. Steaming: Cooking over boiling water. Stewing: Cooking for a long time in water below the boiling point.  Simmering point, 185° F. Roasting: Cooking before a glowing fire. Baking: Cooking in an oven. Frying: Cooking in hot deep fat, deep enough to cover article to be cooked. Sauteing: Cooking in a small quantity of fat. Braising: A combination of stewing and baking. Fricasseing: A combination of frying and stewing. FOOD Food is anything that nourishes the body.  Food is necessary for growth, repair and energy.  The substances comprising the body are obtained from food. All food is changed into liquid before it can be carried about by the blood, to build up the worn-out tissues. Digestion of Food -First step:  In the mouth the food is crushed and some of the starch is changed to sugar by the saliva. Second step:  In the stomach the gastric juice dissolves the proteids. Third step:  In the intestines the bile, pancreatic and intestinal juices act upon the food. (a)  The rest of the starch is changed to sugar. (b)  The rest of the proteids are dissolved. (c)  The fat is divided into small drops and mixed all through the food, just as cream is mixed through milk before it rises to the top. FOOD CLASSIFICATION ORGANIC { I. PROTEIDS }1.

Over this spread a spotless table cloth evenly, the middle crease dividing the table exactly in half. Position of Host and Hostess--Position of the host, at the head of the table near entrance door. Hostess at the foot of the table opposite. Placing Knives, Forks and Spoons--Place the knife or knives at the right of each place, the sharp edge toward the plate; the fork or forks, next, tines up, one inch from the edge, being careful to have the spacing the same at every place. Soup spoons over the plate, handles to the right. Teaspoons to left of forks, bowls up. Place silver in the order in which it is to be used, counting from the outside toward the plate. Placing of Glasses--Place the water glass at right of plate, at end of knife blade. Placing Napkins, Pepper, Salt--Place napkins at left of plate. Pepper and salt near corners, or one of each between the places for two people. Sideboard and Side-table--Object: To hold all extras that may be needed during a meal. WAITING ON TABLE The table should look as neat and attractive as possible. Place everything straight upon the table. Turn no dishes upside down. Always heat the dishes in which warm food is served. Never fill the glasses and cups more than three-quarters full. When passing a plate, hold it so that the thumb will not rest on the upper surface. When refilling the glasses, take hold of them near the bottom and draw them to the edge of the table, then remove them from the table. A waiter passes food to the left side of each person, except beverages, which should be placed at the right. In placing a dish in front of a person, the waiter should stand at the right.    Food and dishes are removed from the right. In passing dishes from which a person is to help himself to a portion, pass it always from the left side, so that it may be taken with the right hand. In passing individual dishes from which the person does not help himself-such as coffee, etc.-set it down slowly and easily from the right hand side. When the dishes are being served by a person at the table, stand at the left hand of that person, hold your tray low and near the table, and take on the tray one plate at a time and place it before the person for whom it is intended, setting it down from the right side. Serve first the most honored guest. When one course is finished, take the tray in the left hand, and stand on the left side of the person you are waiting upon, and remove with your right hand the spoons, knives and forks. Then remove the plate and small dishes, never piling them on top of each other, but removing them one at a time. Fill the glasses before every course. Before the dessert is served, remove the crumbs from the cloth, either with a brush or crumb knife. Do not let the table become disordered during the meal. The hostess should serve the soup, salad, dessert and coffee, and, at a family dinner, the vegetables and entrees. The host serves the fish and meat. To clear the table remove all dishes from each place, then the meat and vegetables. Remove crumbs from the cloth before bringing in dessert. TO CLEAR THE TABLE AFTER A MEAL Brush the crumbs from the floor. Arrange the chairs in their places. Collect and remove the knives, forks and spoons. Empty the cups and remove them. Scrape off the dishes-never set any food away on the dishes used for serving-pile them up neatly and remove to the place where they are to be washed. Brush the crumbs from the cloth and fold it carefully in the old crease, as it lays on the table. If the napkins are used again, place them neatly folded in their individual rings. WASHING DISHES Have the dishes scraped. Pile all articles of each kind together; plates by themselves, the largest at the bottom ; cups by themselves; silver articles together, and steel knives and forks by themselves. Soaking dishes: Cold water should be used for soaking dishes which have been used for milk, eggs and starchy foods. Hot water for dishes used for sugar substances and for sticky, gummy substances like gelatine. Greasy dishes of all kinds, including knives, are more easily cleaned if first wiped with soft paper, which should be burned. Order: I. Glassware; 2. Silver; 3, Cups and saucers; 4. Plates; 5. Platters, vegetable dishes, etc.; 6. Cooking utensils (if not washed first.) To wash dishes: Have a pan half filled with hot soapy water. Slip glasses and fine China in sideways, that the hot water will touch outside and inside at once, and thus avoid danger of breaking. If dishes are very dirty or greasy, add a little washing soda, ammonia or soap. Rinse all dishes in clean hot water (except cut glass), drain and wipe with clean dry towels. A Dover egg-beater should not be left to soak in water, or it will be hard to run. Keep the handles clean, wipe the wire with a damp cloth immediately after using. Kitchen knives and forks should never be placed in dish water Scour them with brick dust, wash with dish cloth, and wipe them dry. Tinware, granite ironware should be washed in hot soda water, and if browned, rub with sapolio, salt or baking soda. Use wire dish cloth if food sticks to dishes. Keep strainer in sink, and pour all dish water, etc., in it, and remove contents of strainer in garbage pail. Wash towels with plenty of soap, and rinse thoroughly every time they are used. Hang towels up evenly to dry. Wash dish cloths. When scrubbing, wet brush and apply soap with upward strokes, working with the grain of the wood; rinse and dry. Wash dish pans, wipe and dry. Wash your hands with white (castile or ivory) soap, if you wish to keep smooth hands, and wipe them dry. Wash teakettle; polish faucets; scrub sink with clean hot suds. CARE OF THE SINK When dish-washing is finished, wash every part of the sink with hot, soapy water. Wash above and around the sink. Use a skewer to clean behind the sink pipes. Flush the sink with boiling water every day and about once a week with a strong solution of washing soda. SWEEPING A ROOM How to Sweep: Before beginning to sweep, see that no food is left uncovered in the room and that all movable articles and furniture are taken out of the room. Sweep from the edges of the room toward the center. Sweep with short strokes, keeping the broom close to the floor. Turn it edgewise to clean cracks. Always sweep a floor before washing or scrubbing it. DUSTING A ROOM Begin at one corner and take each article in turn as you come to it. Dust it from the highest things to the lowest, taking up the dust in the cloth. Dust the woodwork, furniture and movable articles with a soft cotton cloth. Shake it frequently out of the windows. AIRING  A ROOM Lower the upper sash of a window, to let out the foul air which always rises to the top. Raise the lower sash of an opposite window, of same or an adjoining room, to admit fresh air. This will create a draft, that will thoroughly air the room. Bed room windows should always be open at night from the top. REMOVING STAINS When possible remove all stains while they are fresh, as they are less obstinate before dried into the cloth. If a stain has been overlooked and washed in, it is difficult to remove and should be bleached on the grass. Blood Stains--Wash in cold water until the stain turns brown, then rub with Fels Naphtha soap and soak in warm water. If the goods are thick make a paste of cold raw starch and apply several times until the stain is removed. Brass Stains--Rub either lard or olive oil on the stain, then wash with warm water and soap. Fruit and Coffee Stains--Stretch the stained part over a bowl, and pour boiling water through it from a height until the stain disappears. Tea and Chocolate Stains--Are hard to remove, therefore soak them in cold water and borax and then apply the boiling water as for coffee stains. Milk Stains--Wash them out while fresh in cold water. Glue Stains--Apply vinegar with a cloth. Grease Stains--Place a blotter over the stain and iron with a very hot iron. Grass Stains--Wash with Fels Naptha soap and water, or if the colors are not delicate, apply ammonia and water at once. If cotton, wash in alcohol. Ink Stains--Soak in sweet or sour milk, or wet stains in oxalic acid and rinse. Mildew Stains--If the stain is not too old it may be removed by applying soft soap and powdered chalk, keeping it moist and laying it in the sun. Rust--Soak spot with lemon juice, then cover with salt. Let stand in the sun for several hours, or, soak spots in oxalic acid until stain disappears. Rinse thoroughly. Oxalic acid should be used on white material only. Oxalic acid is a poison, should be marked poison and kept out of reach of children. BUILDING A FIRE It is necessary to have: Ist, Fuel.-Something to burn. 2nd, Heat.-To make fuel hot enough to burn. 3rd, Air.-To keep the fire burning. DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF A GAS RANGE. Don't use blacking. When dry and still warm, rub thoroughly inside and out with an oily cloth, using a tiny bit of lard, suet or olive oil. Never clean when the stove is cold. Plunge a wire into the burner holes occasionally to see that they are free from dirt. Wash the wire rack and drip-pan every time you roast or broil. Make test of time required to cook certain things; study the degree of heat required. Such tests will, in a short time, give you definite knowledge of your range, which can be acquired in no other way. Dont light the gas until you are ready to use it. Put it out when you take the things from the stove. When boiling or bub-bling begins, the contents of the vessel have reached the boiling point. You can turn down the burner and still maintain boiling. How to Bake in a Gas Range. The degree of heat required for various foods depends so much upon the shape and size of the loaf of bread, or the pie, or whatever it may be, that specific directions cannot be given, which will exactly fit every case. However, every housewife, if she uses a modern, efficient gas range, should get a hot oven in five minutes after lighting both burners and closing the oven door. TO MAKE A FIRELESS COOKER. Material: A large, closely fitted covered box or pail, Wire netting, Granite iron cooking kettles, with straight sides and closely fitted covers, 10 to 50 lbs. mineral wool, for padding. Cotton cloth or galvanized iron  fitted lining. Place hinges on cover of box, and see that box or pail to be used as the cooker is large enough to hold one, two or three closely covered granite kettles or pails, allowing at least 2 inches of space all around and at the top and bottom of kettles. If your kettles are not of the same height, place enough packing, not necessarily mineral wool, underneath the shorter ones to bring the tops of the kettles on a level. Cut a frame work of wire netting for each kettle, 3 inches longer than the height of the kettle, fit it loosely around the sides, that it may be lifted out easily. Sew down the sides with twine. Fold over 1 inch of wire, all around the top, to make a smooth finish. At the bottom of the wire, 2 inches apart, make 2 inch cuts, upward, all around the bottom. Bend the pieces thus formed, outward, as a foundation on which the framework stands. Place this wire frame work in the cooker box on a layer of mineral wool 2 or 3 inches deep, allowing 2 inch space between kettles and the side of box or pail. Slip kettles in the wire frames and pack mineral wool solidly in all empty spaces, until tops of kettles are reached. Lift out kettles. Make bags of Canton flannel to fit loosely over each cooking kettle. Take piece of goods, size of box or pail, cut out spaces where kettles belong and sew in the fitted bags. Slip this covering over the mineral wool and tack it neatly to the sides of the box or pail. Cover the 3 inch deep cushions that fit over tops of kettles with the flannel. A galvanized iron lining, made by a tinsmith, would be easier kept clean, than the home made cloth affair. Mineral wool sells at about 2 cts. per pound and can be bought at any hardware store. It retains heat a long time. Sawdust, scraps of newspapers, hay or baled shavings may be used in place of the mineral wool. INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  USING  FIRELESS  COOKER. The food is placed in the granite kettles, covered closely and cooked over fire, on a gas, wood, oil, or coal stove, until piping hot (see table, page 16), and immediately slipped into spaces in which they fit. If you use only one of the cooking kettles or pails for food, have the others filled with hot water. Cover pails quickly to retain all the heat and steam possible and place mineral wool cushion over all. Close box quickly and the food will cook evenly and tender. The principle is first to bring the food to the BOILING point on the STOVE, then put it in the Cooker. To secure the best results, the covered kettle should always be filled nearly to the TOP, excess of water to be poured off later. The most import-ant point to be observed, is to have the contents of the covered kettle thoroughly HOT before placing it in the "COOKER." The length of all STOVE cooking should be guided by the SIZE of the article to be cooked. In  preparing small  quantities,  it  is best to  use a SMALL vessel, and when properly heated place it in the Cooker vessel already filled with  BOILING water. It is IMPORTANT to keep the cover on the Cooker kettle until contents are cooked, and not open during time of COOKING. Everything that is usually cooked on TOP of a stove and some that are cooked in the OVEN, can be prepared to better advantage in the Fireless Cooker, as the slow boiling makes everything more tender and delicate, retains all the flavors and has the added advantage that no odors escape into the house. As it is impossible to scorch or overcook any article, it is not necessary to remove the kettle at any fixed time. For infants and the sick who require hot nourishment at all hours of the night, the cooker is invaluable. A dinner can be prepared at noon, then you can go out for the afternoon, and on your return at any time, you can immedi-ately serve your dinner, steaming hot. RECIPES  FOR  FIRELESS  COOKER SOUPS. Soups are prepared as usual, only no allowance should be made for evaporation. Boil twenty minutes on the stove, put in the Cooker five or six hours or all night, the next morning add vegetables to flavor, cook five minutes more, return to Cooker and let remain until noon. In soups the economy of the Cooker is especially noticeable, as the only expensive item, the long cooking over a fire, is avoided. BOILED  MEATS. Season meat with salt, pepper, roll in flour and place in hot, greased frying pan; brown on both sides. Cover with boiling water, boil steadily and slowly for 1/2 hour or until meat is hot in center. Boil hard with cover for a few seconds then slip in Fireless Cooker and allow it to remain 6 or more hours or over night, according to the weight. POT  ROAST. For four or five pound rump roast of beef. Place in an iron kettle two tablespoons of suet. When melted, brown the roast in the fat. Remove the meat to the cooker kettle and cover with boiling water. Boil slowly thirty minutes, with a little salt. Without removing the cover, place in the cooker for four hours. Add a little of the liquor to the fat, and place the meat in and brown for a few minutes on the stove. Thicken the gravy with flour. The liquor can be used for soup. POTATOES BOILED. Pare and cut potatoes in quarters if large. Cover with boiling water. Boil five minutes and remove to the Cooker for one and one-half hours. Potatoes can be left in the Cooker five or six hours without becoming soggy. SAUER  KRAUT. Take one quart of sauer kraut and two pounds of brisket of beef or fresh pork. Cut the meat in slices and mix with the kraut in the kettle. Cover with boiling water and boil ten minutes without lifting the cover. Remove to the Cooker for eight or ten hours. A little salt should be added before cooked, if needed. Drain, and serve on hot platter. TO FRY OLD CHICKEN. Singe and cut up in small pieces. Place in Cooker kettle. Cover with boiling water, add a little salt and boil 25 minutes. Remove to the Cooker for six or eight hours, or over night. Leave in liquor until ready to serve, then brown in hot fat, season with salt and pepper.   Serve with mushroom sauce. ROAST BEEF OR ROAST CHICKEN. Have the bones removed from a rib roast and rolled. Chicken is prepared as for roasting. Place either roast or chicken in hot oven for twenty or thirty minutes until well browned, then place in 4 quart kettle and place that in 8 quart kettle partly filled with boiling water. Have lids on both kettles, and when all is well heated, put into Fireless Cooker for three or four hours. The time in the oven and in the Cooker is dependent on whether the roast is liked well done or rare, and on the size and age of the chicken. BAKED BEANS. Wash and pick over one quart of white beans. Soak over night. In the morning let them come to a boil, add a pinch of soda and drain. Put them into the kettle with one-half pound of salt pork, slash the rind and cover with boiling water. Boil five minutes and remove to the Cooker for five or six hours. Remove the beans to a baking dish. Cut the pork in slices and lay over the top. Season with salt, pepper and four tablespoons of molasses or brown sugar. Bake until a nice brown. BOSTON BROWN BREAD. Follow recipes on Page 32. Pour into well buttered moulds; have mould three-fourths full, with the top buttered. Place on wire rack in Cooker kettle, fill nearly to top of mould with boiling water, boil thirty minutes, remove to Cooker for five or more hours. Place in a hot oven five or ten minutes to form dry crust. By adding half a cup of raisins you have fruit bread. STEWED PRUNES. Wash the prunes and cover with cold water, and soak over night The next morning put them with the water in which they were soaked on the stove and boil five minutes. Sweeten to taste. Remove to the Cooker without removing the cover, for five or six hours. When done, remove prunes to dish and boil syrup ten minutes, and pour over the prunes. TIME TABLE FOR USING FIRELESS COOKER.

CEREALS Cereals or grains are seeds of certain members of the grass family; they form a very important part of the food of man. Cereals are wheat, Indian corn or maize, oats, rice,  rye  and  barley. From  these are prepared various breakfast foods, oatmeal, wheatena, etc. They all contain more or less starch. For family use, cereals should be bought in small quantities and kept in tightly covered jars. GENERAL RULES Boiling water and salt should always be added to cereals--one teaspoon salt to one cup of cereal. They should be cooked directly over heat the first five minutes and then over boiling water in a double boiler. Long cooking improves the flavor and makes them more easily digested. ROLLED OATS OR WHEAT 1 cup rolled oats or wheat, 2 cups boiling water, 1 teaspoon salt. Boil ten minutes, stirring constantly; then over boiling water one hour longer. A better flavor is developed by longer cook-ing. One-fourth pound of dates, stoned and cut in pieces and stirred in the mush, may be added, and served as a dessert for dinner or luncheon. CREAM of WHEAT 1/2 cup cream of wheat, 1 teaspoon salt, 4 cups boiling water. See that the water is actually boiling in a saucepan. Add salt, then cream of wheat gradually. Stir constantly until thick. Cook 1/2 to 3/4 hour over hot water. CORN MEAL MUSH 4 cups boiling water. 2 I/2 teaspoons salt, 1  cup cornmeal. Add the salt to the boiling water. Add the meal gradually, so that the water will not stop boiling, and stir continually, keeping it directly over the heat 10 minutes. Cook over boiling water 1/2 to 3 hours longer. Long cooking improves the flavor. SAUTED CORNMEAL MUSH Put left over mush into a dish and smooth it over the top. When cold cut into slices 1/2 inch thick. Dip each slice into flour. Melt 1/2 teaspoon dripping in a frying pan, and be careful to let it get smoking hot. Brown the flour ed slices on each side. Drain if necessary and serve on a hot plate with syrup. BAKED CORN CAKE 1  pint cornmeal, 2 teaspoons salt, 2  quarts boiling water, 1 oz. butter. Scald cornmeal with water and add salt. Spread about one-fourth inch thick on greased baking pan; finish in hot oven till quite dry. CEREAL WITH SLICED BANANAS I  pint cooked oatmeal, 4 bananas sliced. I pint whipped cream, Pour left-over breakfast cereal into after-dinner coffee cups rinsed in cold water and set aside. When cold and ready to use, turn from the cups onto a buttered pan, and heat in the oven. To serve surround with sliced bananas; whipped cream, clotted cream or plain cream with sugar. BARLEY, TAPIOCA, SAGO, ETC. 1/2  cup barley or other hard grain, 1 qt. boiling water, 1 teaspoon salt. Add salt to the boiling water and pour gradually on the barley, or other hard grain and boil until tender from I to 2 or more hours, according to the grain, and have each kernel stand out distinct when done. Add more boiling water as it evaporates. Use as a vegetable, or in soups. Pearl barley, tapioca and sago cook quicker than the ordinary large grains. BOILED   RICE 1 cup rice, 2 qts. boiling water, 1 teaspoon salt. Pick over rice and wash thoroughly. Add slowly to boiling, salted water so as not to check boiling of water. Boil rapidly for 30 minutes or until kernels are soft. Drain in coarse strainer. STEAMED RICE 1 cup rice, 4 cups boiling water, 2 teaspoons salt. Pick over and wash the rice in three or four waters. Put it with the boiling water and salt into the double boiler. Steam 40 minutes or until tender. Serve with milk or cream. CURRIED RICE 1 cup rice, 3 cups hot chicken or veal broth, 1 onion, 2  teaspoons curry powder, butter. Cover rice with cold water, bring quickly to boiling point, drain and rinse in cold water. Then cook in the chicken or veal broth and when half clone add the onion finely chopped and sauted in butter and the curry powder creamed with a little butter. Mix thoroughly, add more stock if needed, and finish cooking in a slow oven. Serve with hot chicken or veal. TURKISH  PILAF 1/2 cup washed rice, 3/4 cup tomatoes, stewed and strained, 1 cup brown soup stock highly seasoned, 3 tablespoons butter. Add tomato to stock, and heat to boiling point; add rice and steam until rice is soft; stir in butter with a fork and keep uncovered that steam may escape. Serve in place of vegetables or as a border for curried or fricasseed meat. CHAPTER III. BEVERAGES. HOT DRINKS GENERAL RULES A beverage is any drink. Water is a beverage, and is an essential to life. All beverages contain a large percentage of water, and aid to quench thirst, to introduce water into the system and regulate the temperature; to assist in carrying off waste; to nourish; to stimulate the nervous system and various organs. Freshly boiled water should be used for making hot beverages; freshly drawn water for making cold beverages. MILK Vessels used for milk must be thoroughly cleansed; they should be first washed in clear, cold water. Fill them with water in which a teaspoon of borax or bicarbonate of soda has been dissolved, and let stand one hour. Then scald, wipe thor-oughly, and stand in the sun or near the stove to dry. Cover milk with muslin and keep in a cold place. Milk may be sterilized or pasteurized to destroy disease germs. In summer, milk should be sterilized twice a day, for babies or young children. PASTEURIZED MILK. Sterilize milk bottles or jars by boiling them twenty minutes in water. Fill sterile bottles or jars nearly full of milk, cork them with baked cotton, place on rings in a deep pan and fill with cold water so that the water may be as high outside the jars as the milk is inside, place the pan over the fire and heat until small bubbles appear around the top of the milk (about I550 F) ; re-move to the back of the fire and allow the bottle to stand there 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature as quickly as possible, and when milk is cold remove the bottles from the water and keep in a cold place. In summer milk should be pasteurized twice a day for babies. COFFEE AND TEA Coffee the seeds of the berry of the coffee tree, are roasted in order to develop the aroma. Coffee contains a stimulating sub-stance, called caffeine, and tannin. The tannin is an injurious substance found in tea and coffee. Long steeping develops the tannin. Tea is made from the leaves of the tea plant. Tea leaves have to be wilted, rolled and dried by artificial heat in order to develop their flavor. Green tea is made from freshly picked young leaves, which are prepared quickly. Ex.: Gunpowder, Hyson and Japan. Black tea is made from leaves left in a heap on the ground, in order to darken and develop the flavor. Ex.: Oolong, English Breakfast, Orange Pekoe. Tea and coffee should never be taken on an empty stomach unless for medicinal purposes. Coffee should be bought in small quantities and kept in air-tight cans. FILTERED COFFEE. 1 cup coffee, finely ground. 6 cups freshly boiling water. Place coffee in strainer, strainer in coffee pot and pot over slow fire. Add gradually the boiling water and allow it to filter or drip. Cover between additions of water. If desired stronger, refilter. Serve at once, with cut sugar, cream or scalded milk. Put sugar and cream in cup, then add the hot coffee. BOILED COFFEE 1 heaping teaspoon ground coffee to 1 cup of freshly boiling water. 1 cup ground coffee to 1 quart freshly boiling water.

CHAPTER IV. BREAD, ROLLS AND TOAST. GENERAL RULES Flour should be kept in a dry atmosphere. It makes better bread if heated just before using. The yeast must be fresh. Scald the milk or water, then cool until lukewarm. The heat of the oven should be increased slightly the first twenty minutes, then kept even for twenty minutes, and the last twenty minutes it should decrease. Bread should be kept in a clean tin box, and not exposed to moisture. Yeast is a plant, the small, invisible germs of which are floating in the air. They settle in various places, and when they find a warm, moist, sweet, strength-giving or nitrogenous mixture, they begin to grow. Hot water kills the yeast plant; cold water chills it. Lukewarm liquids should be used. When the yeast plant grows it causes fermentation, which changes some of the starch into sugar, and then some of the sugar into alcohol and carbon-dioxide or carbonic acid gas. This carbon-dioxide gas raises the dough. If it rises too long, it will make the bread sour. Dough is made light in four ways: 1. By the use of yeast. 2. By the use of baking powder. 3. (a) By the use of soda and molasses. (b) By the use of soda and sour milk. 4. By beating air into a mixture. BREAD 2 cups scalded milk, or boiling water, 1 tablespoon butter or other fat, 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 oz. compressed yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup lukewarm water, 1 tablespoon sugar, 6 to 6 1/2 cups flour. Put salt, sugar and butter in large mixing bowl; pour on the hot milk or water; when lukewarm add dissolved yeast and five cups flour, mix and stir well with knife or mixing' spoon. Add remaining flour, mix and turn the dough out on a flour ed board and knead until soft and elastic. Put it back into the bowl moisten cover, and let it rise in a warm place until double its bulk, cut down, toss on flour ed board, then divide into loaves and place into greased or flour ed pans. Cover the bread and again allow it to double in bulk, then bake one hour in a hot oven twelve seconds by the hand. Biscuits require more heat and less time to bake. Remove from pans and place in draft if you wish a hard crust. If a soft crust is desired, roll bread in a clean cloth. If set in day time, use 1 cake yeast. This recipe makes 2 loaves. If set at night, use 1/2 cake yeast. For 4 large loaves talcs 3 pints milk or water, 3 tablespoons each of salt, sugar, fat or butter, 5 quarts flour, 1 oz. yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup lukewarm water. BRAIDED BREAD (BARCHES) Take bread dough when ready to shape into loaves. Divide into halves, thirds, fourths, etc., according to the number of strands desired for each loaf. Knead slightly and roll the strands evenly, prick with a fork, then twist into braid. Place each braided loaf--into a pan ( flour ed) to rise until very light. Brush top of bread over with yolk of well beaten egg to which a tablespoon of cold water has been added and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake in hot oven forty-five to sixty minutes, and cool in a draft to form a hard crust. TO GLAZE BREAD AND ROLLS. Brush top of bread or rolls over with yolk of egg, to which a pinch of sugar and a tablespoon of cold water has been added. Bake in hot oven and cool in a draft, if you wish a hard crust; if a soft crust is desired, brush over with a little melted butter or sweet cream as soon as it comes out of the oven, or put 2 tea spoons of cornstarch into a saucepan, add 2 tablespoons cold water, mix and add half cup of boiling water. Stir over the fire till it cooks for 5 minutes. Shortly before the bread and rolls are ready, brush the top over with cornstarch mixture, then return to the oven to dry. Repeat this process in 5 minutes and a soft, rich crust will result. For sweetened rolls and buns dredge the top plentifully with granulated sugar, then baste with the cornstarch preparation, then return to the oven to dry. RYE BREAD. Rye bread is made same as wheat bread, using rye in place of the wheat flour. If desired, one-fourth to one-half the quanity of wheat flour may be mixed with the rye. Caraway seeds sprinkled in the dough makes a desirable flavor. Bake longer than the wheat bread. Oven must be hot, and the crust should be hard. Brush loaves with water to make them shine. SOFT GRAHAM BREAD. 3 cups graham flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1  cup white flour, 2 tablespoons butter, 1  teaspoon salt, 3/4 yeast cake, 1/2 cup molasses, or 1 1/2 cups warm water. Dissolve the yeast with a little of the lukewarm water, mix the other ingredients in the order given, and add sufficient luke- warm water to make a soft dough. Cover bowl and set in warm place. When the dough is light beat it and pour into the bread pans, filling them half full. When light, bake in a moderate oven. GLUTEN  BREAD 3 cups milk or water, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 1/2 oz. yeast (1 cake), 1/2 teaspoon salt, About 3 pints gluten flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, if agreeable. 1 egg, Make a sponge, with the milk or water lukewarm, the yeast crumbled and softened, and a pint of flour. When light, add salt, butter, sugar, if used, the beaten egg and gluten flour to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic. Shape into loaves. Bake about 1 hour. ENTIRE WHEAT BREAD. 2  cups scalded milk, 1 yeast cake, dissolved in 1/4 cup lukewarm water, 1/4 cup sugar, or 1/3 cup molasses, 4 2/3 cups of coarse entire wheat flour, 1 teaspoon salt, Add sweetening and salt to the milk; cool, and when luke-warm, add the dissolved yeast cake and flour; beat well, cover, and let rise to double its bulk. Beat again and turn into greased bread pans, having pans one-half full. Let rise and bake. Entire wheat bread should not quite double its bulk during last rising. This mixture may be baked in gem pans. GRAHAM BREAD OR WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 1  cup boiling water, 2 tablespoons warm water, 1  cup fresh milk, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 oz. yeast (1 cake), 2 tablespoons sugar, Whole wheat flour. Select whole wheat flour, free from outside bran, pour 1/2 the boiling water into the fresh milk. When lukewarm add yeast, dissolved in 2 tablespoons of warm water, salt and sugar. Mix and stir in sufficient whole wheat flour to make a batter that will drop from a spoon, beat well, cover securely to exclude air and let stand in a warm place (about 75°) for 3 hours, or until quite light, then stir in sufficient flour to make a soft dough, knead lightly for about 10 minutes, making a softer loaf than for white bread. Mould 2 loaves, place in greased pans, cover and let stand in a warm place until the loaves are double their bulk, about 1 hour. Bake in a slow oven for about 1 1/2 hours. Add 1 cup nuts when moulding into loaves, if desired. CURRANT BREAD. 2  pints of flour, 2 cups milk, 3  teaspoons  baking  powder, 1 cup currants, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon sugar.

No. 3 2  cups corn meal, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 egg, 1/4 teaspoon soda, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 cups sour milk. Mix the dry ingredients, add the egg beaten lightly and the sour cream and milk. Beat well and bake in shallow pans, in a hot oven about half an hour. STEAMING BROWN BREAD. Brown bread may be steamed by letting stand in a steamer over boiling water, or on a trivet, in a kettle of boiling water. The water should rise to about half the height of the mould. In either case, the mixture is to be placed in a greased, tightly closed mould. The best results are secured when the water is gradually raised to the boiling-point. After this point is once reached, it needs to be maintained until the cooking Is finished, about three hours. Even longer cooking is of no disadvantage. BOSTON  BROWN  BREAD No. 1 1 cup rye meal, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup corn meal, 3/4 cup molasses, 1 cup graham flour, 1 3/4 cups sweet milk, or warm water. 3/4 teaspoon soda, Mix and  sift  dry  ingredients;  add milk and molasses, and place in a covered, greased mould and steam two and one-half hours, or steam in small cups one hour.

Pastry flour should be used, if possible. Flour must be sifted before it is measured; then mix and sift dry ingredients. Six teaspoons of baking powder will raise 1 qt. of flour. The eggs are beaten whole and the milk added to them, then added to the dry ingredients. When fat is used, it is usually melted and added last, but may be worked into the flour with the tips of the fingers, or cut in with a knife. The pans or muffin rings should be greased before the mixture is prepared. Iron gem-pans must be heated. The oven must be ready for baking before mixtures are prepared; they must be put into the oven as soon as prepared and baked from 12 to 30 m. Bake on the floor of the oven; they may be raised to the shelf to brown. BAKING POWDER BISCUITS 2 cups flour, 3/4 to 1 cup milk, or water, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 2 tablespoons shortening. 1/2 teaspoon salt, Sift the dry ingredients together. Rub the butter into the flour with the tips of the fingers. Mix the milk into the flour with a knife adding the milk gradually until as soft as can be handled easily. Put it on a flour ed board and roll until 1/2 inch thick. Cut in small rounds and bake in hot oven 10 to 15 minutes. Use as little flour as possible on the board when shaping the dough. WHEAT MUFFINS 2  cups, flour, 1 tablespoon butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1  teaspoon molasses, 3  teaspoons baking powder, 1 egg, 2  tablespoons sugar, 1 cup milk. Mix dry ingredients and sieve twice, rub in the butter. Sep-arate the egg. Beat the yolk and add it to the milk and molasses. Mix with the dry ingredients and stir until smooth. Fold in the beaten white of egg and pour into hot, well greased muffin tins. Bake fifteen to twenty minutes in hot oven. NOTE- Graham, rye, cornmeal, or whole wheat muffins are made the same way, by mixing with the wheat flour one-fourth to one-half the quantity of graham, rye, cornmeal or whole wheat flour. WHOLE WHEAT MUFFINS. 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1 egg, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 1 cup milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons butter, melted.

Wash eggs as soon as they come from the store. Eggs should never be boiled, as that renders them tough and difficult of digestion. They should be cooked just under the boiling point. SOFT COOKED EGGS Have the water boiling, drop in the eggs gently, and place on stove where they will simmer  but  not boil, for from five to eight minutes.

Do not put in refrigerator on account of odor. The flesh should be firm and the eyes bright, the gills, bright red. Fish is less stimulating and nourishing than the meat of other animals, but is easier of digestion. To Scale Fish --Use fish -scaler, ordinary grater or knife. Begin at the tail end and go toward head, slanting the knife toward you to prevent scales from flying. Rinse and cleanse thoroughly in t old water. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper, to preserve it and improve the flavor. The head and tail may be removed. Dry fish need butter rubbed over them before broiling. When fish is cooked the flesh separates from the bone. It can be served hot or cold with a sauce or garnished with lemon, hard -cooked eggs or parsley. Cold cooked fish may be used in various ways, as creamed, scalloped, etc. TO BONE A FISH Clean the fish thoroughly. Cut open and remove entrails. Beginning at the neck, on the inner side of fish, cut with a sharp knife, the bones on one side, close to the backbone. Cut down to the tail close to the backbone, so the fish will lay flat on the board. Scrape flesh from bone with back of knife, removing in one piece the backbone and bones attached to one side. Remove bones from other side with knife and pick out remaining small bones. Take care not to break the outer skin. FRIED FISH Clean fish, wipe dry as possible, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in flour, crumbs, or cornmeal, then in egg and again in crumbs. Let stand a few moments. Then fry a golden brown in deep, hot fat. SAUTED FISH Clean fish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in flour or corn-meal, and cook in spider with enough hot fat to prevent its sticking to the pan. Shake the pan occasionally. Brown well on under side, then turn and brown on the other side. BROILED FISH Clean the fish. Split a thin fish down the back, and if you prefer, cut off the head and tail. Cut thick fish into slices and remove skin and bone. Oily fish need only salt and pepper, but dry fish should be spread with a little butter before broiling. Use double wire broiler and grease it. Put the thickest edge of the fish next to the middle of the broiler and broil the flesh side first. Cook about eight to twelve minutes, or until a delicate brown. Move the broiler up and down, that all parts may be equally browned, and then turn and cook the other side to crisp the skin. Broil over a clean fire, or if gas stove is used, one inch from gas in hot broiling oven. When done, the fish should be white and firm, and separate easily from the bone. Remove to a hot platter, flesh side up, first loosening fish from broiler Spread with salt, pepper and butter, and garnish with slices of lemon and parsley. BROILED SMELTS Use only the largest smelts, split them down the backs, clean and remove the backbone. Rub each fish with a little olive oil sprinkle with salt and pepper, lay them on a greased broiler, and hold them under the gas flame for two or three minutes on each side. Have ready a nicely browned slice of toast for each smelt, lay the fish on the toast, put a bit of butter on each and garnish with watercress and points of hard boiled eggs. Serve with Tartar Sauce, page 92. BROILED  SARDINES Twelve large sardines broiled under the gas flame for a few minutes, (in a broiler). Serve on toast, 2 sardines for each person.

Since they cost at least five times as much as milk, they are clearly not an economical food; but their flavor and ease of digestibility are highly prized. Large oysters are, generally speaking, more nutritious than small ones. Take up each oyster separately in the fingers and remove all bits of shell and seaweed.   Pour cold water over them to cleanse. them, and drain them in a strainer. Oyster liquid is seldom used, as enough comes from the oysters in cooking, but if desired it should be strained through clean cheese-cloth before using.

The fibres of the meat contain nearly all the proteids (albumen). Soaking meat in cold water draws out the blood, dissolves part of the organic salts, the soluble albumen and the extractives or flavoring matters. Boiling water hardens albumen on the outside, keeping in the juice. Intense heat, as in boiling, roasting or pan broiling, does the same thing. Cooking under the boiling point after the first ten minutes causes the toughest meat to become tender. Meat is said to be "kosher" when the animal from which it is taken has been cut in the throat (not knocked in the head ), the blood allowed to flow out that it may not coagulate. Before using, to further draw out the blood, it is soaked one-half hour in cold water, then allowed to stand one hour in salt, and then rinsed in cold water. BROILED STEAK Wipe, trim off extra fat. Grease the broiler with some of the fat. Broil over a clear fire, turning every 10 seconds. Cook 4 or 5 minutes if liked rare; longer if well done. Place on a hot platter and season, serve with Maitre d'Hotel Sauce, page 91. Beef steak should be tender and cut 1 inch thick. Porterhouse steak may be served with Mushroom Sauce, page 89. TO BROIL STEAK ON GAS STOVE Wipe steak with a damp  cloth. Trim off the surplus fat. When the oven has been heated for from five to seven minutes, lay steak on a rack, greased, as near the flame as possible, the position of the rack  depending on the thickness of the steak. Let  the steak sear on  each  side,  thereby  retaining the juice. Then lower the rack somewhat, and allow the steak to broil to the degree required.Just before taking from the oven, salt and pepper and spread with butter or melted fat. You can get just as good results in preparing chops, fish, ham and bacon 111 the broiling oven BROILED TENDERLOIN Three pounds tenderloin cut into three or four pieces. Flatten a little, season with salt, pepper, a little sweet oil and broil Serve  with sauce Bearnaise, page 92, or if preferred,  melted butter. Follow directions above for broiling.

HOW TO ROAST MEATS WITH GAS Meat is much better when roasted below the flame, than baked in the oven. Lay the roast on the broiling pan, placing it as near the flame as possible, till the meat is thoroughly seared outside. Then remove the roast to a medium distance from the flame, depending, of course, on its size. When the bake oven is not in use, you can finish roasting your meat there more quickly than in the broiling oven, if you are in a hurry. The advantage of the broiling oven for roasting, however, lies in the fact that it is heated by the same flame that heats the bake even. ROAST  BEEF Prepare and season meat as desired. Dredge with flour. Place on rack in dripping pan, with two or three tablespoons of fat, in a hot oven, that the surface may be quickly seared, thus preventing escape of its juice.

Cut through the skin around the leg 1 inch below the leg joint; take out the tendons and break the leg at the joint; in old birds each tendon must be removed separately by using a skewer. Remove pin feathers with the point of a knife. Remove oil bag from the tail. The internal organs are not always removed before the chicken is sold. If they have not been removed, make an opening under one of the legs, or at the vent, and remove them carefully, leaving a strip of skin above the vent. The intestines, gizzard, heart and liver should all be removed together; care must be taken that the gall bladder, which lies under the liver, be not broken; it must be carefully cut away from the liver. The lungs and the kidneys lying in the hollows of the backbone must be carefully removed. Cut off tip of heart and cut open to extract any blood. Cut gizzard through to the inner coat, half way around, take off the outer coat and throw the inner bag away. The gizzard, heart and liver, constitutes the giblets, and are prepared in numerous ways and may be used in making gravies and dressings for roasted poultry.

The parts of the flower in the center of the bud are called the choke and must be removed. When the artichoke is very young and tender the edible parts may be eaten raw as a salad. When it becomes hard, as it does very quickly, it must be cooked. When boiled it may be eaten as a salad or with a sauce.

Add the remainder of the liquid gradually to make a batter, and beat in the stiff white of the egg. DIRECTIONS FOR FRYING Frying is cooking in deep hot fat. Cooking in Deep Fat --General Rules. The fat used for cooking may be olive oil, cottonseed oil, cottolene, beef drippings, lard, or a mixture of several fats. The food must be covered with crumbs and egg, or a batter, to keep it from absorbing fat. Place the articles to be cooked in a bath of the fat, deep enough to float them. The kettle should be of iron; a frying basket may be used. Foods already cooked or needing little cooking require a higher temperature than batters. The temperature of the fat for oysters, croquettes, fish balls, etc., may be tested by browning a cube of tread while counting forty.  Counting sixty, while the bread browns, gives the right temperature for all other batters. All the articles cooked must be drained on unglazed, brown paper. When one quantity of food has been taken from the fat, it must be reheated and tested before adding a second set. In the absence of a frying basket, a wire spoon may be used to remove the food from the fat. Fat which has been used for frying should be cooled and clarified by cooking with a few slices of raw potato in it for 10 minutes; strain through muslin, and when cold cover. Fat may be used several times for frying and then be made into soap. APPLE FRITTERS 2 medium sized sour apples, Batter No. 1 or 2, Powder sugar, Lemon juice. Core, pare and cut apples in 1/3 inch rounds or slices, sprinkle with powdered sugar and a few drops of lemon juice, cover and let stand 1/2 hour.

PINEAPPLE FRITTERS Soak slices of pineapple in Sherry or white wine, with a little sugar and let stand one hour. Drain and dip slices in Batter No. 1 or 2, page 213, and fry in deep hot fat. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with powdered sugar. FRUIT FRITTERS Fresh peaches, apricots or pears may be cut in pieces, dipped in batter and fried same as other fritters. Canned fruits may be used after being drained. QUEEN FRITTERS 1/2 cup boiling milk or water, 1/4 cup butter, 1/2  cup flour, 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 2 eggs, Pinch of salt, Fruit Preserves.

CHAFING DISH RECIPES CHAFING  DISHES The chafing dish is king, and everyone is looking for new recipes with which to regale and surprise his friends at the evening lunch. It is said that the chafing dish originated with the Israelitish women, and that it has been used through each succeeding generation by both men and women. A tray should always be used under the chafing dish, as there is so much danger of setting fire to the tablecloth from the overflow of the alcohol, when no tray is used. When a recipe calls for milk or cream, the hot water pan should be used in all cases, to avoid all possibility of burning; but when something is to be sauted or fried, this pan is omitted and the dish is placed directly over the flame; constant watching and turning and shaking is necessary, however, as the alcohol flame is hot and comes in direct contact with the metal pan. Oysters are usually cooked in the blazer only, at first, and then, when they are plump, if a sauce is to be added to them, the hot water pan is introduced underneath.

COLD PUDDINGS CUSTARDS GENERAL RULES FOR CUSTARD Eggs should be thoroughly mixed, but not beaten light, with sugar and salt, add the hot milk slowly, stirring all the time. Custards must be cooked over moderate heat-over water in the oven if baked, or in a double boiler is steamed. When thick enough, the custard coats on the spoon. It curdles if cooked a minute too long. If it curdles, put in a pan of cold water immediately and beat until smooth. Always strain custards. Use the yolks instead of the whole eggs to make a soft custard. SOFT CUSTARD 1 pt. milk, scalded, 4 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon flavoring, 1 egg or 2 yolks. Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt; add egg slightly beaten. Add scalded milk, stirring constantly. Cook in double boiler until it thickens slightly. Strain, cool and flavor, CHOCOLATE CUSTARD Follow the recipe for soft custard, melting one-half ounce chocolate with the milk. COCOANUT CUSTARD 1 pint milk, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 eggs, separated, 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 3/4 cup cocoanut, Heat milk with sugar, and when steaming add the yolks of the eggs beaten light, and a few grains of salt; remove from the fire, and while warm add cream. Beat until smooth and partly cool, pour into a serving dish, beat the whites of the eggs with the powdered sugar and cocoanut, spread upon the top of custard, and brown lightly in the oven. FLOATING ISLAND 1 pt. milk, 4 eggs, 4 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon spice, or 1/4  teaspoon salt, 1/2  teaspoon flavoring. Scald the milk. Separate the eggs. Mix salt, sugar and corn-starch. Add to yolks and beat slightly. Beat the whites until very stiff, add 2 teaspoons sugar to them, beat slightly and spread mixture on top of the hot milk. Let cook 2 or 3 minutes until firm, lift out on a plate and pour the hot milk on the beaten yolks. Put this mixture into a double boiler and stir until it thickens. When nearly cool stir in flavoring, put the cooked Whites on the top and serve cold as a pudding. A pretty way to serve it is to lay specks of jelly on the whites CUP CUSTARD OR BAKED CUSTARD 1 pt. milk, 2 eggs, 4 tablespoons sugar, pinch salt. Beat eggs slightly, add salt and sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and pour the milk into the beaten eggs. If desired a little nutmeg or flavoring may be added. Pour into buttered cups or a pudding dish, place the cups in a pan of boiling water, put the pan in the oven and bake until the custards are firm in the center--20 to 30 minutes. Try with a knife. If the knife comes out clean the custard is done. ORANGE CUSTARD 1 pt. milk, 3 eggs, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 3 oranges or 6 bananas. Separate the yolks and whites of eggs. Beat yolks lightly, add the salt and sugar, and beat well. Pour the hot milk slowly into the eggs. Stir constantly until mooth and thick, and train. When cool, flavor with vanilla. Peel and slice oranges or bananas, and place in serving dish. Pour on the custard, and take whites of the three eggs (beaten very light), one-fourth and cup powdered sugar and few drops of vanilla for the meringue, and drop in large spoonfuls on the custard. Any kind of fruit may be substituted for oranges or bananas. COFFEE CUSTARD 1 cup very strong cold coffee, 4 eggs, beaten slightly, 1  cup thin cream, 4 tablespoons sugar. Mix and strain into small cups and place them in a shallow pan. Put boiling hot water into the pan until it reaches half way up to the cups. Set into a moderate oven and cook very gently until the custard is firm. Serve ice cold with little cakes. CARAMEL CUSTARD 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup hot water, 4 eggs, 8 yolks of eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 quart milk. Cook three-fourths a cup of sugar in a small sauce pan over the fire, until the sugar melts and becomes light brown in color. Lift the pan from the fire occasionally, to prevent burning. Add very carefully, as the mixture will steam up to some height, about one-fourth a cup of boiling water, and let stand in a hot place, until the caramel on the spoon and dish is melted. Beat four whole eggs and eight yolks with half a teaspoonful of salt. Add half a cup of sugar, and beat again. Then add one quart of milk and the caramel, and strain into a mould. Bake, standing in a pan of hot water on heavy asbestos paper, until a knife, cut down into the center, comes out holding no uncooked mixture. When cold, pass a knife between the mould and custard, and turn onto a serving-dish. Half instead of three-fourths a cup of sugar will give enough caramel flavor to suffice the taste of some. CUSTARD WITH CARAMEL SAUCE 1/2 cup sugar, 3 whites of eggs, 4 eggs, or 2 whole eggs and 4 yolks. 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 pt. milk. Melt 1/2 cup sugar in a spicier until changed to a smooth liquid caramel. Turn quickly a little caramel into a timbale mould, keeping the rest hot, while the mould is turned round and round thus lining it with the caramel. Proceed in the same way with all the moulds, or if you prefer line a large pudding dish with the melted sugar or caramel. Set aside. Make a custard of the remaining ingredient; add salt to sugar and beat with the eggs, then add the milk; stir well and pour into the caramel lined moulds or pudding dish. Cook standing in hot water until custard is well set, testing with a knife, if knife comes out clean custard is done. When cold remove from  moulds onto the serving dish. The caramel will form a sauce around the custard. Two ounces of melted chocolate with a little melted sugar and water, may be added to the milk of which custard is made, or the caramel may be melted in a little boiling water and used in the custard instead of sugar, thus giving caramel custard.

CHAPTER XXVII. Pastry An illustration of a lady making pie. PASTRY AND PIES GENERAL RULES All of the materials must be as cool as possible. The shortening should not be cut very fine, if a flaky crust is desired. The dough should be mixed with a knife and not touched with the hands. It should be rolled on one side, using but little flour. The dough is rolled thin and baked until brown. Meat and oyster pies should be made without an undercrust. The crust should be cut in several places to allow the steam to escape. If an undercrust is used, this crust may be baked on the outside of a tin plate, then filled. In this case, the crust must be pricked all over with a fork, so that it may keep its shape. If two crusts are used, the lower one should be moistened around the edge with cold water, then a 1/2 inch strip of paste may be placed around the edge of the undercrust. This strip should also be moistened, and the uppercrust placed over the pie and pressed slightly around the edge. The paste may be made the day before using then covered and placed on ice. It rolls more easily if placed on ice alter mixing. PLAIN PASTRY OR PIE DOUGH 1 1/4 cups flour (pastry), 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/3 to 1/2 cup shortening, ( butter or other fat ), 1/3 to 1/2 cup cold water. Use butter, beef drippings, lard or any other desired fat, alone or mixed. Sift flour, salt and baking powder into a chopping bowl. Flour the blade of a chopping knife or a small empty baking powder can and chop the shortening into the flour until the mixture looks like meal; or rub the shortening into the flour with the tips of the fingers. Use knife to mix the dough, adding, the cold water gradually and use only enough water to make a paste that is not crumbly, but sticks together without adhering to the knife or bowl. Take up all the particles of chough or flour on the sides of the bowl and with aid of knife turn on to a board lightly dredged with flour, pat with rolling pin and roll out. Use no more flour than is absolutely necessary. Roll in 2 circular pieces 1/8 inch thick; have one a little larger than the other and place it on the pie tin or plate loosely without stretching. Brush over top of this dough, with white of egg, slightly beaten, or sprinkle with a tablespoon of bread crumbs to prevent the dough from becoming soggy. Put in the filling, brush over the edge of pastry with cold water, and lay the second round of paste loosely over the filling; press the edges together lightly, and trim, if needed. Cut several slits in the top crust, or prick it with a fork before putting it in place. Bake in a slow oven from 35 to 45 minutes. Brown well. SHORT OR FLAKY PASTRY 1 heaping cup flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup lard, 1/4 cup butter, Ice water. Have all the material ice cold. Chop the shortening in the flour till the size of peas and beans . Toss lightly with a knife, adding enough ice water to about half wet the flour. Turn out on a smooth, cold board. Gather with the knife into a square pile. Then pound lightly with rolling pin till well flattened Roll in an oblong piece 1/2 in. thick; fold in thirds and roll again; repeat, and after the third rolling it will usually be sufficiently compact to roll thin enough to line a plate. This paste improves by standing half an hour or more on the ice. Sufficient for 1 pie. COOKIE DOUGH FOR PIES 1 tablespoon butter, 1 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 cup sugar, 1 egg. Mix dry ingredients. Work in butter with the finger tips; add egg; mix. Toss on slightly flour ed board and roll 1/4 inch thick. This makes enough dough for a large oblong pan; used for apple, cheese, blueberry or any other fresh fruit open pie. PUFF PASTE 1 lb. flour, 1 lb. butter, A little ice water. All the utensils used should be ice cold. Chill the flour; divide the butter into three parts; wash and pat each into a thin oblong pat; wrap two of the butter pats in a napkin and place them between pans of cracked ice; with the tips of the fingers work the other butter pat into the flour, keeping plenty of flour between the butter and the fingers; add ice water, using as little as possible to make a smooth paste; toss the paste on flour ed board, knead just enough to form a ball; shape pat and roll out one-fourth inch thick, keeping paste a little wider than long and corners square; lay one pat of the butter on the paste, dredge very lightly with flour; fold over the paste so as to enclose the butter; roll up like a jelly roll; pat and roll out one-fourth inch thick add butter and roll out as above. After all of the butter has been added, fold and roll out four or five times; the more times it is folded and rolled out the more air will be enclosed. The more air retained in the paste the more puffy it will be. The rolling should be done with gentle strokes from center out. As often as the paste becomes a little soft, place it in a napkin between two pans of cracked ice and let it stand until thoroughly chilled. puff paste requires a hot oven, greatest heat coming from the bottom; turn frequently that it may rise evenly; when well risen, decrease temperature of oven. puff paste should be used for pies, patties, vol-au-vents, rissoles, cheese straws, tarts, turnovers, etc. MURBERTEIG FOR PIES OR FILLED TORTES No. 1 3 cups flour (3/4 lb.), 1 cup butter (1/2 lb.), 1/4 cup sugar, Yolks of 2 eggs, 1 tablespoon brandy, 1/4  cup cold water.

For directions see page I. Bring all materials to the work table. The measuring cup should hold 1/2 pint. Sift flour and dip it with spoon or scoop into cup. When measuring by the spoonful, pick up a heaping spoonful, run the back of a knife along the bowl of spoon and level off the top. Divide level spoonful through the middle lengthwise for 1/3 spoonful. Always sift baking powder with flour. Use pastry flour and granulated sugar. Grease pans with unsalted melted fat; then dredge with flour, invert, and shake the pan to remove superfluous flour. In filling pans have the mixture come well to the corners and sides of the pans, leaving a slight depression in the center, that cakes may bake flat. Cake pan should be filled nearly two-thirds full if the cake is expected to rise to the top of the pan. In baking cake divide the time into quarters. 1st, The mixture should become heated and begin to rise; 2d, continue rising and begin to brown; 3d, continuing browning; 4th finish baking and shrink from the pan. Do not move the cake in the oven while in a soft condition as that will break the air bubbles More all their cells are cooked, thereby causing the cake to fall. When done the cake will shrink from the sides of pan or will spring back quickly if pressed gently with the finger on the center of the cake. TO TEST OVEN FOR CAKE For Moderate Oven. A piece of soft yellow wrapping paper should burn golden brown in 5 minutes. For Hot Oven. Paper should burn golden brown in 4 minutes. For Slow Oven. The paper should burn golden brown in 7 minutes. Loaf Cakes with butter (cup cakes) require moderate oven; Layer Cakes, hot oven; and Sponge Cakes, slow oven. If cake is put in too cool an oven, it will rise too much and be of very coarse texture. If too hot, it browns and crusts over the top before it has sufficiently risen. If, after the cake is put in, it seems to bake too fast, put a brown paper loosely over the top of the pan, and do not open the oven door for 5 minutes at least; the cake should then be quickly examined and the door carefully shut, or the rush of cold air will cause it to fall. Setting a small dish of hot water in the oven will also prevent the cake from scorching. To remove cake from pan: Loosen around the edges with a knife and rest pan on its four sides successively; then invert on wire cake cooler or on a board, covered with a piece of old linen or cheese cloth. Let tire cake cool before icing it. Cakes may be classed under two heads : Those that contain butter, Cup and Pound, and those without butter, Sponge and Torte. CAKES WITH BUTTER BUTTER OR CUP CAKES In making butter cakes, creaming the butter encloses air, and makes a delicate texture. The butter should be moderately soft but not melted melted in the least, or the cake will be sodden and heavy. The oven must be ready for baking, the pans thoroughly greased with the same kind of fat used in the mixture. Sift flour before measuring; pastry flour should be used.   The flour and baking powder must be mixed and sifted several times and if spices are used they should be sifted with the flour. Use fine granulated sugar to make a fine texture. Cream the butter, add the sugar gradually. The yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten separately, and the yolks added to the butter and sugar. The bowl in which they were beaten should be rinsed with the milk. The milk and flour are added alternately, then the flavoring, and the beaten whites of the eggs. When fruit is used save a little flour to cover it and add just before the whites of the eggs. Do not beat the mixture after adding the whites, as the mixture is so much heavier than the whites, that in the beating many of the air bubbles will be broken, the air will escape, and the cake be less light. Bake cake from 20 to 40 minutes or until it shrinks from the sides of the pan. When taken from oven allow it to remain in the pan about 3 minutes. Raisins quartered and seeded and sprinkled with flour may be added to the cake just before baking. All measurements are level, see page I.

Beat well with a vegetable masher. When perfectly smooth remove from the fire, and as soon as cold break into it 5 eggs, 1 at a time, beating hard with the hand. When the mixture is thoroughly beaten (it will take about 20 minutes), spread on buttered sheets in oblong pieces about 4 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Bake in a rather quick oven for about 25 minutes. As soon as they are done, ice with either chocolate or vanilla frosting. Make an icing with the white of two eggs and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. Flavor with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Frost the eclairs, and when dry, open on one side, and fill with Custard Filling, page 330. Or, they may be filled with cream, sweetened, flavored with vanilla and whipped to a stiff froth. Strawberry and raspberry preserves are sometimes used to fill eclairs. CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS 2 squares chocolate, scraped, 5 tablespoons powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons boiling water. Put chocolate, powdered sugar and boiling water over the fire and stir until smooth and glossy. Dip the tops of the eclairs in this as they come from the oven.

Use any desired sponge cake, cup cake or torte, that is not too delicate to handle. Bake in small fancy shaped tins or in a sheet. When baked in a sheet the cake may be cut in any square, oblong diamond, heart or round shape with knife or cutters. Scraps of devil's food or chocolate cake may be used by crumbling the cake and mixing it to a paste with syrup and a little rum for flavor. These are formed into small balls, rings and crescents. Cover cakes with Fondant, pages 391-392, in a variety of colors and flavors, keeping the icing warm and creamy over hot water (in little tin cups). Slip cakes one at a time on knife into the softened icing, dip quickly, then place on oiled paper for several hours to harden. Then decorate. Cut pistachio nuts lengthwise in slices, and green limes in small pieces, to represent leaves; cherries cut in pieces length-wise and the violet and rose leaves, to represent flowers. Raisins may be pressed flat and cut in fanciful shapes. Dip the end of the ornaments lightly in a little warm icing to make them stick to the frosting. When baked in a sheet, the cake may be cut in pieces, covered with white icing, and, for a musical entertainment, be decorated with chocolate icing in the form of a bar of music, pressing the chocolate through tube. Make dominoes by dipping oblong cakes, shape and size of a domino block in Chocolate Icing, page 326; when hardened decorate with dots of Whote Fondant or Icing (thick), page 392; pressed through a paper tube to represent the different numbers on the blocks.

CANDIES GENERAL RULES Syrup boiled from sugar for candies must hang from the end of a spoon to form a thick drop, and long silk-like threads hang from it, when exposed to the air. The syrup is then 238 degrees Fahrenheit, and when a drop is tried in cold water, the water will remain clear and the syrup will form a soft ball and will just keep its shape. Boil a few moments longer, and try in cold water, and if the syrup becomes brittle, and it forms a hard ball, it is at 248 degrees Fahrenheit. When the syrup begins to discolor it is at 310 degrees, while at 350 degrees it is caramel or burned sugar. The syrup should only be stirred until the sugar is dissolved; if stirred while hot, it will grain or sugar. SUGAR Sugar is made for common use from sugar cane, sugar beets and maple sap. This sugar is called sucrose. Honey is the purest natural form of sugar. Glucose, or grape sugar, is found in honey, fresh fruits and on the skins of dried fruits, such as raisins, dates, etc it is also made for commercial use from the starch of corn . The sugar of milk is called lactose. Sugar made from sugar cane and sugar beets is the kind most commonly used. The products of sugar cane are molasses, brown sugar, granulated, cutloaf, powdered and confectioners' sugar. Only white sugar is made from beets. Sugar is very easily digested, as it dissolves so readily. It is a very necessary food when taken in small quantities. It produces heat and energy in the body; children, being more active than grown people, naturally crave more sweets. EVIL EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH SUGAR If sugar in any form is left on the teeth, it will ferment, and cause them to decay. If too much is eaten at one time, part of it will ferment in the stomach and interfere with the digestion of other foods. PEANUT  BRITTLE No. 1 2 cups sugar, 1/2 to 1 cup shelled peanuts, 1/3 cup water. Put sugar and water in saucepan and cook until light brown. Have peanuts sprinkled over buttered pan.

Line a greased pan with the peanuts. Put sugar in saucepan, and heat till it becomes a thin, light brown syrup, stirring constantly. Pour over peanuts and mark in squares. When cool, break in pieces.

Remove skins from peanuts and proceed same as for almonds. CHAPTER XXXIV. FRESH AND STEWED FRUIT STRAWBERRIES EN NATURAL Pick over the berries, but do not remove stems. Place carefully in colander in a pan of cold water, so the water will cover the berries; lift colander up and down, change the water and thus wash the berries. Place berries in small plate, on rose geranium leaves, if desired, and at the side put one leaf with a tablespoon of powdered sugar. Or omit the leaves, have small mound of powder sugar in center of plate and surround with the berries, or stem and wash the berries, place in sauce dish and serve with sugar or with sugar and cream. TO SERVE AN ORANGE Cut an orange in half crosswise. Place on an attractive dish, scoop out the juice and pulp with a spoon and sweeten if necessary. West Indian Way: Peel the oranges, taking off as much, white skin as possible, then slice them off all round as you would an apple, regardless of the sections. This leaves the seed, tough, stringy central part, and most of the inner skin together, and is a much less tedious process than removing the skin by sections. Use a very sharp knife, so as to make clean cuts and not crush the fruit. Cut out each section separately, and put on a small plate in the form of a daisy. Put white sugar in center. Oranges with Cocoanut : Pare the oranges, slice as thin as Possible, place in small saucers, covering the fruit thickly with fine shredded cocoanut, then add powdered sugar, and for every six dishes of the fruit use the juice of one orange divided among them. Let stand half an hour before serving. GRAPE FRUIT Cut in half, with a sharp knife, remove seeds, and sprinkle with sugar, or loosen pulp, and thick, pithy white center; wipe knife after each cutting that the bitter taste may be avoided.

MUSK MELONS Select Rockyford melons, a very small green, firm nutmeg melon. Cut in halves, remove seeds and put where they will keep cool, tied in paper bag, in the ice chest, as the odor of the melon is quite decided and will cling to other foods. When ready to serve, fill with crushed ice and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve in the beginning of a dinner, breakfast or luncheon, or fill with plain ice cream and serve as a dessert at the end of a meal. Other melons may be served the same way, but are not so dainty. TO SERVE WATERMELON Cut a watermelon, chilled by standing on ice, in slices and remove the shell, or cut out the red portion with tablespoon or divide into cubes an inch square and remove seeds. If you desire, add a little wine or have ready a mixture of half a table-spoonful of ground cinnamon to half a cup of powdered sugar, and sprinkle this over the melon; refill the melon shell. Let stand a few moments. BAKED APPLES Wipe and core sour apples. Place them in an earthen dish and fill the center of each apple with sugar.

CHAPTER XXXV. FRUIT SYRUPS, JUICES AND WINES. FRUIT SYRUPS AND JUICES The only difference between syrups and juice is that in the syrup there must be at least half as much sugar as fruit juice. These syrups are used for flavoring ice creams and water ices. They also make a delicious drink, when two or three spoonfuls are added to a glass of ice cold water. Fruit juice is most desirable for drinking or for culinary purposes. Currant juice may be sterilized and canned without sugar. This juice may be made into jelly at any season of the year. Fruit juices that are designed for use in frozen creams and water ices should be canned with a generous amount of sugar. For grape juice good bottles are to be preferred to fruit cans. If you can get the self-sealing bottles, the work of putting up grape juice will be light.  Sterilize bottles and corks, page 423. TO MAKE A DRIPPING BAG Take a three cornered piece of cloth or felt, sew two sides together, and attach the third side or opening to an iron hoop. Tie stout cord to opposite sides of hoop and hang up. Place crushed fruit or juice in bag to drip. SUGAR SYRUP 2 cups sugar, or 1 lb. brown sugar, 1 cup water (scant). Boil till clear, do not stir after the sugar and water are mixed.    Cool and serve with griddle cakes. LEMON SYRUP 12 lemons, juice, 6 lemons, grated rind, 6 lbs. sugar, 6 qts. boiling water. Add grated rind of lemons to juice and let stand over night pour water over sugar and stir until sugar is dissolved then boil.   Cool and add the strained lemon juice, squeezing as much of the oil from the grated rind as possible. Bottle and seal. Serve diluted with an equal amount of fresh water. ORANGE SYRUP 12 oranges , juice, 2 lemons , juice, 6 oranges, rind, 1 lemon, rind, 6 lbs. sugar, 6 qts. water. Follow directions for making lemon syrup, in above recipe, substituting the orange juice and rind. CHOCOLATE SYRUP 8 oz. soluble chocolate, 2 1/2 quarts water, 8 1/2  lbs. white sugar. Thoroughly dissolve the chocolate in hot water, then add the sugar, and heat until the mixture boils. Strain while hot. After it has become cool, vanilla may be added. This is a preparation for the special use of druggists and others in making hot or cold soda. It forms the basis for a delicious freshening, nourishing and strengthening drink. UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE 10 lbs. Concord grapes, 2 qts. water, 2 lbs. sugar. Pick over and wash grapes. Place in kettle, cover with the water and let boil until the seeds are free. Strain while hot through bag and squeeze thoroughly; heat to boiling point and skim. Let boil up again and skim; then add sugar, more, less or none, as preferred. Heat to the boiling point; fill patent air tight bottles (not too  full, allowing room for the corks to go down), and cork immediately. If ordinary bottles and corks are used place corks over bottles very lightly at first, immediately after filling, and as they cool off push corks down, always a little deeper then cover air tight with melted paraffine or sealing wax Ordinary fruit cans may also be used, the small ones preferred. NOTE-- Grape juice is particularly good as a drink. It may be canned with or without sugar, but, except where the grapes have a large percentage of sugar, as is the case in California, some sugar should be added to the juice in canning. Almost any variety of grape may be used, and yellow, red or purple juice may be obtained, according to the color of the grape, the Muscat, Concord, Catawba, Isabella or Iowa. Use only clean, sound, well ripened, but not over-ripe grapes. TRANSPARENT GRAPE JUICE If you wish a particularly clear grape juice, great care should be taken in the heating of the grapes, before pressing and in the straining or filtering. Wash the grapes and pick them from the stems. Crush the grapes well, place in a bag. Hang bag up securely and twist it, or, let two persons take hold, one at each end, and press out the juice. Place juice in a double boiler or in a large enameled pan or kettle, in a pan of hot water and heat the juice gradually until it steams; if a deeper color is desired, heat to the simmer point, do not let it boil. If you wish the juice extra clear, let it now stand 24 hours to settle. Carefully remove juice from pan, that the sediment at the bottom is not disturbed and drain through cloth or Dripping Bag, page 402. Then pour into clean bottles, not too full, as the heat expands the juice; place the filled bottles in a steamer or a wash boiler, protected by a thin board or rack, fill boiler with cold water to within one inch of top of bottles and gradually heat until about to simmer. Then take the bottles out and cork immediately. If ordinary corks are used place them on lightly at first and as the bottles cool off push corks down, then cover air-tight with melted paraffine or sealing wax. If corks, even of patent bottles, are forced down too quickly the bottles are apt to crack. CURRANT AND RASPBERRY JUICE 4 qts. currants, 2 qts. red raspberries, 3 qts. water, 3 lbs. sugar. Pick over and wash fruit. Place in preserving kettle, cover with the water and let boil until soft, Strain well through jelly bag. Measure, and to every quart of juice add 1 cup of sugar. Heat to the boiling point and immediately fill into sterilized cans to overflowing. Screw on covers of cans and when cool screw air tight. Do not fill too full if bottles with patent stoppers are used. If ordinary bottles are used, cover with cork lightly at first and as it cools off push in until air tight and cover corks with paraffine or sealing-wax, melted. Cherry, Plum and Peach Juices-- To preserve the juices of these and similar fruits, proceed as for Jelly, page 408 but adding to each quart of juice, one cup sugar, If not desired to have the juice transparent, press the pulp of the fruit to extract all the liquid. RASPBERRY SHRUB 4 qts. raspberries, 1 qt. vinegar, Sugar. Take red or black raspberries, mash them and cover with the vinegar. Let stand over night or longer; strain. To each pint of juice, add 1 lb. sugar, boil 20 minutes, then put in sterilized bottles and keep in a cool, dry place. Use two tablespoons to a glass of water. Blackberries or strawberries may also be used. BLACKBERRY  CORDIAL 8 qts. blackberries, (Lawtons), 2 quarts cold water, 4 lbs. sugar, 1 tablespoon each, whole allspice, cloves, and cinnamon bark, 2 qts. whiskey or brandy. Tie spices in a thin bag. Pick over, wash the berries. Place in preserving kettle, cover with the water, let boil thoroughly soft; then strain well. Measure and to each quart of juice add 2 cups sugar (1 lb.). Add spice bag and boil about 20 minutes or until thick. Let cool and measure again. To each quart of syrup, add 1 pint of whiskey. Bottle and cork tightly. Will keep for years, the older, the better. CHERRY BOUNCE 1 qt. cherries, 1/2 lb. sugar (cut loaf), 1 pint whiskey, 1 tablespoon allspice, cinnamon and cloves ( heads removed), Wash cherries and pick off the stems. Fill a large mouthed bottle alternately with a thick layer of cherries, a layer of loaf sugar and a few of the whole spices, continue until the bottle is almost full. Then pour in the whiskey until full. Cork and let stand in a dark closet for 2 months or more, older it is the better. GRAPE WINE No. 1 Mash the grapes well and then strain and press through a cloth. Then add barely enough water to the pressed grapes to cover them. Strain the juice thus obtained into the first portion. Put three pounds of sugar to one gallon of the liquid. Let it stand in a crock or tub, covered with a cloth, from three to seven days. Skim off what rises every morning, without disturbing the contents. Put the juice in a cask, leave it open for twenty-four hours; then bung it up and put clay over the bung to keep the air out. Let young wine remain in the cask until March, when it should be drawn off and bottled. Or, if you have no cask pour wine in jugs, allowing the corks to remain very loose; when through fermenting, fill into bottles. After all signs of fermentation cease, put in the corks very tight, and tie or wire them in and seal. Keep in a cool place. Currant, Blackberry, Elderberry or Rhubarb wines are made the same way, using less sugar for Blackberry and Elderberry wines. No. 2 9 lbs. Concord grapes, 4 3/4 lbs. sugar. Wash and pick over the grapes and place in a 2 gallon jar. Fill with cold water. Cover with cheese cloth and keep in a warm place. Stir twice a week for 6 weeks. Strain and let stand 2 weeks longer to allow wine to settle. Fill in bottles not necessarily air tight. RAISIN WINE 2 lbs. large raisins, seeded and chopped, 1 lb. white loaf sugar, 1 lemon, cut up, 6 quarts boiling water. Put all in a stone jar, cover and stir every day for a week. Then strain, bottle and cork. Good in 10 or 12 days. DANDELION WINE 1 gallon dandelion flowers, 1 gallon boiling water, 3 lbs. sugar, 3 oranges, cut in small squares, 3 lemons, cut in small squares 1 oz. yeast. Pick dandelion flowers early in the morning, taking care not to have a particle of the bitter stem attached. Pour the boiling water over the flowers and let stand three days. Strain and add the rest of the ingredients and let stand to ferment three weeks Strain and bottle. TARRAGON VINEGAR 3 oz. tarragon, or Estregan leaves, 1 qt. good white wine, or Cider vinegar. Strip the leaves from the branches of the estregan or tarragon about the last of August. Put into a quart fruit can and fill with the vinegar, close and let stand 20 days, then strain. Use for salads or sharp sauces. ROSEL,  BEET  VINEGAR Place beets in a stone crock, removing greens. Cover with cold water and put in a warm place and let stand for three or four weeks or until mixture becomes sour. This is used as a vinegar during Easter or Pesach and to make beet soup, Russian style. CHAPTER XXXVI. JELLY GENERAL RULES FOR JELLY MAKING Wash the fruit and remove stems and imperfections. Cut large fruit into pieces. With watery fruit, such as grapes and currants, use no water. With apples and quinces use enough water to cover them. Cook the fruit until the juice flows, crushing it with a spoon. Remove it from the fire and strain it through a pointed bag hung from the ceiling or between two chairs. Do not squeeze the bag at first; when nearly all is strained through, the bag may be squeezed. Keep this last juice by itself; the jelly made from it will not be clear, but can be used for jelly cake, etc. Measure the juice and put an equal quantity of sugar in the oven to heat. Boil the juice with the sugar until the jelly thickens slightly when dropped on a cold plate, or if the last drop on the spoon can be held while counting sixty. Pour into sterilized jelly glasses and set aside to harden. Then label. Jelly must be covered to protect it from mould. Paraffine is convenient for this purpose. If fruit is fully ripe, use 1/4 less sugar. Apples, quinces, crabapples, currants and grapes make the best jellies. An acid fruit is the most suitable for jelly-making. The fruit should be fresh, just ripe, or a little under-ripe. Juicy fruits, such as currants, raspberries, etc., should not be gathered after a rain. Fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, peaches, which will not "jell" easily, make beautiful jelly, if 1/3 rhubarb or pieplant juice is used. The jelly will be clearer and finer, if the fruit is simmered gently and not stirred during the cooking. If the syrup boils too rapidly, it will not jell. Medium-sized granite preserving kettles are best to use in making jelly. They are lighter to handle and quickly and easily cleaned. Do not make a large quantity at a time; a quart of juice is quite enough. FILLING AND COVERING THE GLASSES First heat your glasses thoroughly, by standing in a pan of tepid water and  allowing it to get scalding hot. Then set them on a damp cloth spread on the table or board. Pour jelly at once into  these, filling almost to running over, as jelly will shrink. Let stand until cold. To prevent jelly from moulding brush the top over with brandy or alcohol. Dip a disk of thick white paper the size of the top of the glass, in the brandy and put it on the jelly. Then pour a layer of melted paraffine over the paper. If the glasses have covers, put them on. If paraffine is used, break it into pieces and put in a cup. Set the cup in a pan of warm water on the back of the stove. In a few moments it will be melted enough to cover the jelly. Have the coating about a fourth of an inch thick. In cooling the paraffine contracts, and if the layer is very thin it will crack and leave a portion of the jelly exposed. CRABAPPLE JELLY 8 quarts apples, 4 quarts water, Sugar. Select under-ripe Siberian crabapples, a yellow pink cheeked apple. Wash, cut in halves, but do not pare or core the apples. Boil until soft. Mash and pour into jelly bag and let drip into large pitcher or jar. Do not squeeze. Take equal parts of juice and sugar. There should be about 3 quarts of juice. Put juice on to boil, let boil 5 minutes, add the sugar, boil a few minutes longer; or until a drop jells on a cold plate. Skim and turn into hot glasses. When cool, cover with paraffine, and keep in a cool, dry place. Crabapple Sauce may be made by straining the drained apples. adding sugar and cinnamon or lemon juice to taste, and heating it up only long enough to dissolve the sugar. CRABAPPLE AND PLUM JELLY 3/4 peck crabapples, Water to barely cover sugar, 1/4  peck plums. Select under-ripe fruit. Wash and pick over, but do not pare or seed. Boil until soft. Mash and pour into jelly bag to drip. Do not squeeze. Take equal measures of sugar and juice, let juice boil 5 minutes, add sugar and boil until a drop jells on a cold plate. Skim and turn into hot glasses, cover and keep in a cool, dry place. Reserve the pulp, strain through sieve, sugar to taste and use as sauce. CRABAPPLE AND CRANBERRY JELLY 1/2 peck crabapples, 2 quarts cranberries. Follow directions for Crabapple and Plum Jelly, recipe above. CURRANT AND RASPBERRY JELLY 4 quarts currants, 4 pints raspberries, Sugar. Select the cherry currants. They should not be over-ripe nor gathered after a rain. Pick over the fruit, but do not take the stems from currants. Mash the fruit, using wooden potato masher. Cook slowly until currants are nearly white. Strain. Take equal parts of sugar and juice. Boil five minutes, add heated sugar and boil three minutes. Skim, and pour into glasses. Cover and keep cool and dry. CURRANT JELLY WITHOUT COOKING To make currant jelly by the cold process follow the first rule for jelly as far as dissolving the sugar in the strained juice. Fill warm, sterilized glasses with this. Place the glasses on a board and put the board by a sunny window. Cover with sheets of glass and keep by the window until the jelly is set. The jelly will be more transparent if the juice is strained through the flannel bag. Jelly made by the cold process is more delicate than that made by boiling, but it does not keep quite so well. Or, wash and mash currants well, let stand a little while and strain. Place juice in stone jar and place in the coolest part of cellar for 24 hours. Remove scum from top, strain and to 1 pint of juice add 1 pint sugar; stir until sugar is dissolved.Put in glasses and seal. In 24 hours you will have a perfectly transparent jelly. No heat is required. GRAPE JELLY An acid grape is best for this jelly. The sweet, ripe grapes contain too much sugar. Half-ripe fruit, or equal portions of nearly ripe and green grapes, will also be found satisfactory. Wild grapes make delicious jelly. Grapes should be picked over, washed and stems removed before putting into preserving kettle. Heat to the boiling point and cook until the seeds are free, about 30 minutes. Pour into jelly bag to drip. Take equal measures of sugar and juice and boil until it jells. Skim and pour into sterilized glasses. Keep in cool, dry place. PLUM JELLY Use an under-ripe acid plum. Wash the fruit and remove the stems. Put into the preserving kettle with 1 quart of water for each peck of fruit. Cook gently until the plums are boiled to pieces.   Strain the juice and proceed the same as for other jelly. FILLED CURRANTS (BAR-LE-DUC) 10 cups large currants, stemmed, 10 cups sugar. Add sugar to currants, washed and stemmed, and let cook slowly and steadily from 20 to 25 minutes. Pour in jelly glasses, cover, and keep in a dry, cool place. CHERRIES IN CURRANT JELLY 2 qts. currant juice, 8 lbs. sugar, 2 qts. stemmed and pitted cherries. Wash, mash and cook slowly at first as many currants, with stems, as will make 2 quarts of strained juice. Let juice come to a boil, add sugar and skim; add cherries and cook slowly and steadily from 10 to 15 minutes. Pour in jelly glasses, cover and keep in a dry, cool place. MINT  JELLY Snow apples, Equal weight sugar, Fresh mint leaves. Wipe apples, pare, removed stem and blossom ends and cut in quarters. Put in preserving kettle, add cold water to barely cover and add enough mint leaves, well washed, to give a decided mint flavor. Cover and cook slowly until apples are soft; wash, drain in jelly bag. Boil 20 minutes, add the sugar, heated; add more mint leaves, if desired, let boil 5 minutes. Skin and turn in glasses. Let stand in sunny window 24 hours. Cover and remove to dry, cool place. CHAPTER XXXVII. Preserving and Pickling. An illustration of a girl tried to take a bottle of preserved fruit. PRESERVED AND PICKLED FRUIT PRESERVES Fruit is preserved by cooking it with from three-fourths to its whole weight in sugar. PRESERVING SMALL FRUITS RAW An easy and excellent method of preserving small fruits, such as currants, strawberries and raspberries, is by putting them up raw. Look the fruit over and mash each berry carefully, or put through food grinder, then take equal parts of crushed berries and sugar and mix together. Let stand in a cool place over night to dissolve the sugar. Can the next morning in Mason jars. The success of this method depends upon mashing each berry and having the sugar thoroughly dissolved before canning. Cherry Currants are particularly nice done up this way. Pineapples, sliced pared, cored, and put through the food grinder or chopped fine and allowed to stand overnight in an equal amount of sugar and then packed in air tight sterilized jars keep well and retain their natural flavor. BAKED CRAB APPLE PRESERVES 1/2 peck crab apples, 4 lbs. sugar, a 1 gallon stone jar, 1 tablespoon water. Wash, wipe and remove the blossom ends of perfect, large red Siberian crab apples. Pour water in bottom of jar, then place in alternate layers of apples and sugar (with sugar on top). Cover with two thicknesses of Manila paper, tied down securely or with close fitting plate. Bake in a very slow oven (that would only turn the paper a light brown), 2 or 3 hours. Let stand to cool; keep in cool, dry place. Baked Sickel Pears -- May be prepared the same way. Flavor, if desired, with ginger or lemon juice. Baked Quinces -- Quinces may be wiped, cored, and quartered; sugar filled in the cavities, and baked same as crabapples, in a very slow oven 3 or more hours until clear and glassy. BAKED CRANBERRIES OR CHERRY  PRESERVES 4 quarts cranberries or sour cherries, 4 quarts sugar, a 1 gallon stone jar. Pick over, wash and drain large, perfect cranberries; or stem and then stone large cherries (with new steel hairpin so they remain whole). Place a tablespoon hot water in jar, then alternately in layers cranberries or cherries and sugar (with sugar on top), cover closely. Bake in a very slow oven 2 hours. Let stand. Then keep in a cool, dry place. Look and taste like candied cherries. CHERRY OR RASPBERRY PRESERVES 5 lbs. cherries or raspberries, 5 lbs. sugar. Wash berries carefully that they do not mash; or wash, pick over and stone the cherries. Place in preserving kettle, alternate layers of sugar and fruit; let stand over night. Bring slowy the boiling point  and boil slowly  until  thick. Put away in glasses or jars. GOOSEBERRY PRESERVES The berries should be picked when they begin to show signs of ripening. Stem carefully, drop them into cold water and let come to a boil. Remove from fire and pour off the water and when the berries have cooled drop them into boiling syrup (made by using just enough water to sugar to form a liquid), heating very slowly. Seal. The berries will stay quite whole and if the operation has been carefully done, will keep for years. GRAPE MARMALADE. 4 lbs. grapes, 4 lbs. sugar. Pick over, wash, drain, and remove stems from grapes. Heat to boiling point and cook slowly until seeds are free. Rub through fine sieve. Return to kettle, and add equal measure of sugar; cook slowly thirty minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Put in jars or tumblers. GINGER PEARS 8 lbs. pears, 4 lbs. sugar, 1/4 lb. Canton ginger, 4 lemons. Wipe pears, quarter, core and remove the stems and cut into small slices. Add sugar, the ginger, cut fine, and the juice of the lemons. Cut the lemon rinds into long, thin strips; mix all together and let stand over night. Place in preserving kettle, on stove and let cook slowly for three hours, or until thick and clear. Put in stone jar, well covered, or in glass cans. GINGER APPLES. 1 qt. sour apples, diced, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 lemon, 2 cups water, 6 pieces ginger root. Wipe, pare, quarter, core and cut the apples into small squares. Grate the rind of the lemon.

Will keep for several weeks, or longer if filled while hot in air-tight cans. ORANGE MARMALADE. 12 sour oranges, 2 lemons, 3/4 lb. cut sugar, To 1 lb. fruit. Select smooth skinned oranges. Remove peel from skin in quarters. Cut the rind of 1/2 of the oranges and lemons into yery narrow strips, with scissors. Place shredded peel in sauce pan, cover with cold water, let boil up once, drain through blander. Repeat 4 times, to extract bitter taste of rind. Take the peeled oranges and lemons and with a sharp knife peel as you would an apple, the thin outer skin, through to the pulp. Separate pulp from section walls, with point of knife and remove pulp, rejecting seeds, and core with tough section walls attached Place pulp in preserving kettle; heat to boiling point, add sugar gradually and cook slowly 1 hour; add the shredded cooked rind and cook one hour longer. Fill in glasses. QUINCE AND SWEET APPLE PRESERVES. 1 peck quinces, 1/2 peck pears, 1/4 peck sweet apples, (Tolman), Sugar. Wash and pick over the fruit, then peel and core. Cut the quinces and apples in rounds and the pears in quarters. Cover cores and peels with cold water, boil thoroughly and strain. For each pound of fruit allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar, add to the strained liquid and let boil until a clear syrup. Boil the rounds of quince in cold water until they can be pierced with a silver fork, remove carefully to platter and then into the boiling syrup. Add the rest of the fruit and boil slowly and steadily for three or four hours until the fruit is clear and a deep red color. Pour into crocks and cover. RADISH OR BEET PRESERVES, (Russian Style) 1 lb. beets or 1 qt. radishes, 1 qt strained honey. Cut radishes (black), in thin slices 1/4 by 1 inch. Cook in boiling water 3 or 4 minutes. Drain and dry between towels. If beets are used cook them and then cut same as the radishes. To 1 cup of the vegetables take 1 cup honey and cook until the mixture is thick enough to drop heavy from the spoon. Add a little ginger to the beets. Serve cold mixed with almonds cut in thin slices. Put away in glasses or jars. STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. Select large, sound strawberries. Pick and wash them carefully. Place in preserving kettle alternately one quart of berries and one pound of sugar. Let stand over night. Place on stove let cook steadily for several hours until the fruit is clear. Put in jelly glasses or jars. SUNSHINE STRAWBERRIES. Use equal weights of sugar and strawberries. Put the strawberries in the preserving kettle in layers, sprinkling sugar over each layer. The fruit and sugar should not be more than 4 inches deep. Place the kettle on the stove and heat the fruit and sugar slowly to the boiling point. When it begins to boil, skim carefully. Boil ten minutes, counting from the time the fruit begins to bubble. Pour the cooked fruit into platters, having it about 2 or 3 inches deep. Place the platters in a sunny window, in an unused room. Cover with a piece of cheese cloth or with glass, for three or four days. In that time the fruit will grow plump and firm, and the syrup will thicken almost to a jelly. Put this preserve, cold, into jars or tumblers. SUNSHINE CURRANTS OR CHERRIES. Select large, firm red or white fruit, remove the stems, and proceed as for strawberries. Stone the cherries before weighing. GREEN TOMATO PRESERVES. 1 quart sliced  green tomatoes, 2 pints sugar, 1 lemon, sliced and seeded, 1 stick cinnamon, or, a few cassia buds.

Canned fruit is preserving sterilized fruit in sterilized, air-tight jars, sugar being added to give sweetness. Fruits may be canned without sugar, if perfectly sterilized, that is, freed from all germ life. Can each kind of fruit in its season, when it is best and cheapest. Select it under-ripe rather than over-ripe. There are several methods of canning; and while the principle is the same in all methods, the conditions under which the housekeeper must do her work may, in her case, make one method more convenient than another. For this reason three will be given which are considered the best and easiest. These are: Cooking the fruit in the jars in an oven. Cooking the fruit in the jars in boiling water. Stewing the fruit before it is put in the jars. When the fruit is cold wipe the jars with a wet cloth. Paste on gum labels, and put the jars on shelves in a cool, dark closet. TO STERILIZE THE JARS. For a small family use pint jars. Buy jars with tight-fitting covers, and fit them each with new rubber rings. Old rubber becomes porous and lets in air. Fit each jar with a ring and a cover; pour water into them and invert them to see if they are air-tight If not, do not use them. Having the jars, covers, and rings in perfect condition, the next thing is to wash and sterilize them. Have two pans partially filled with cold water. Put some jars in one, laying them on their sides, and some covers in the other. Place the pans on the stove where the water will heat to the boiling point. The water should boil at least ten or fifteen minutes. Have on the stove a shallow milk pan in which there is about 2 inches of boiling water. Sterilize the cups, spoons, and funnel, if you use one by immersing in boiling water for a few minutes. When ready to put the prepared fruit in the jars slip a broad skimmer under a jar and lift it and drain free of water. TO PREPARE THE SYRUP. Put the sugar and water in the saucepan and stir on the stove until all the sugar is dissolved. Heat slowly to the boiling point and boil gently without stirring for 10 minutes. Follow Table at head of Chapter, for the proportion of sugar and water used for the various fruits. DIRECTIONS FOR PUTTING FRUIT INTO JARS. 1. Take jar from boiling water and set on a wet cloth or tray. 2. Put sterilized spoon and fruit funnel in jar. 3. Pour in the boiling fruit. 4. Dip rubbers in boiling water and put them on jars quickly . 5. Fill jars to over-flowing. 6. Put on sterilized cover and screw tight. 7. Turn upside down. CANNED FRUIT--Stewed. Boil sugar and water 10 minutes, to make a thin syrup; then cook a small quantity of the fruit at a time in the syrup; by so doing, fruit may be kept in perfect shape. It saves time to have two or more kettles of syrup on the stove, each with enough syrup for one can. Add the fruit in rotation to the boiling syrup, that one can may be taken up as soon as the last one is done Test if soft with a wooden splinter or silver fork. Set the sterilized jar in the small pan and fill to overflowing with the boiling fruit. Slip a silver plated knife or the handle of a spoon around the inside of the jar, that the fruit and juice may be packed solidly. Wipe the rim of the jar, clip the rubber ring in boiling water and put it smoothly on the jar, then put on the cover and fasten. Place the jar on a board and out of a draft of cold air. The work of filling and sealing must be done rapidly, and the fruit must be boiling hot when it is put into the jars. If screw covers are used, it will be necessary to tighten them after the glass has cooled and contracted. If there is not sufficient syrup, add boiling water, as jars must be filled to overflowing. CANNED  FRUIT--Baked in the Oven. In this method the work is easily and quickly done and the fruit retains its shape, color and flavor. Particularly nice for berries. Sterilize jars and utensils. Make the syrup; prepare the fruit, the same as for cooking. Fill the hot jars with the fruit, drained, and pour in enough hot syrup to fill the jar solidly. Run the handle of a silver spoon around the inside of the jar. Place the hot jars, uncovered, and the covers, in a moderate oven. Cover the bottom of the oven with a sheet of asbestos, the kind plumbers employ in covering pipes, or put into the oven shallow pans in which there are about two inches of boiling water. Cook berries to the boiling point or until the bubbles in the syrup just rise to the top; cook larger fruits, 8 to 10 minutes or according to the fruit. Remove from the oven, slip on rubber, first dipped in boiling water, then fill the jar with boiling syrup. Cover and seal. Place the jars on a board and out of a draft of air. If the screw covers are used tighten them after the glass has cooled. Large fruits, such as peaches, pears, quince, crab apples, etc., will require about a pint of syrup to each quart jar of fruit. The small fruit will require a little over half a pint of syrup. CANNED FRUIT--Steamed. Wash, wipe and pare the fruit as usual and pack it carefully into the cans. Boil sugar and water to a syrup and fill the cans solidly. Place covers loosely over cans; no rubbers. Have wooden or wire rack in bottom of wash boiler. Put in enough warm water to come to about 4 inches above the rack. Place the filled jars in the boiler, but do not let them touch one another. Pack clean white cotton rags around the jars or thin slabs of wood between, to prevent them from striking one another when the water begins to boil. Cover the boiler, place over slow fire and gradually increase the heat to the boiling point. Let berries just come to a boil, or boil slowly from 5 to 8 minutes, larger fruit from 10 to 30 minutes until sufficiently cooked. Count from the time when the surrounding water begins to boil. Draw the boiler back, lift off the cover and when the first steam passes off, take one jar at a time, add rubber, dipped in boiling water, fill up with boiling syrup and seal. Put the jars on a board and do not let cold air blow upon them. If screw covers are used tighten them when the glass has cooled and contracted. CANNED APPLES.

Put a layer of the prepared fruit into the preserving kettle and cover with some of the hot syrup. When the fruit begins to boil, skim carefully. Boil gently for ten minutes, then put in the jars and seal. If the fruit is not ripe it may require a little longer time to cook. It should be so tender that it may be pierced easily with a silver fork. It is best to put only one layer of fruit in the preserving kettle. While this is cooking the fruit for the next batch may be pared. CANNED PEACHES-Steamed. 1 qt. peaches, halved and peeled, 1 cup sugar, 2 cups water, 1 qt. can, air-tight, or 2 pint cans, air-tight.

Pack closely in clean, air-tight can or cans and add a few of the stones. Cover cans to keep peaches from discoloring. Make a syrup by boiling the sugar with the water 10 minutes. Pour hot over the peaches, toward center of can, so as not to crack the can; place cover loosely over can. Set the cans on a wire, to protect them from the fire, in a deep kettle with luke warm water filled to within an inch of the neck of the can. Cover the kettle or steamer closely, that no steam escapes. Let slowly come to the boiling point, increasing the heat gradually. Let boil steadily 8 minutes; lift off the cover of kettle, remove cover of cans, one at a time, slip on a new rubber, dipped in boiling water and if syrup does not fill can to overflowing, add more syrup, boiling hot, and screw down cover at once.

INVALID COOKERY In preparing food for an invalid the following points should be kept in mind: The food should be served in the most pleasing manner possible. It should be served in small quantities, suit the diges tive powers of the patient, and satisfy hunger or furnish needed strength. In a severe illness the doctor prescribes the kind and amount of food to be given. In long and protracted illness it is neces sary to take nourishing food in small quantities at frequent intervals. In short spells of illness it is sometimes best to go without food for a day or more, so as to give the system complete rest. The following foods are easily digested and are given to invalids: Milk, eggs (raw or slightly cooked), beef tea, gelatinous jellies, gruels, well-cooked cereals, raw oysters, juice of oranges, grapes or other fruit. SERVING FOOD Use the daintiest dishes in the house. Place a clean napkin on the tray, and, if possible, a fresh flower. Small quantities are more tempting to a delicate appetite. Try to surprise the patients by some unexpected food and in this way induce them to take nourishment. Serve hot food hot, and cold food cold. Remove the tray as soon as the food is eaten, as food should never be allowed to stand in a sick room. MILK Milk is the natural food of the young. Its value in the dietary of adults is often overestimated. Solid food is essential. One obtains the greatest benefit from milk when taken alone at regular intervals between meals, or before retiring, and sipped rather than drunk.   Hot milk is often given to produce sleep. In feeding infants with milk, avoid all danger of infectious germs by Sterilization, page 20, or Pasteurization, page 20. To prevent acidity of the stomach, add from one to two' teaspoonfuls of lime water, to each half pint of milk. Vessels used for milk must be thoroughly cleansed; tins should be rinsed in luke- warm water and washed thoroughly with hot water, then rinsed in boiling water. Cover milk with muslin and keep in a cool place. Modified milk it put up by physicians' prescriptions; the milk is separated into its parts, and re-combined in different proportions to suit the needs of individual cases.
