I OF GRAVIES AND SAUCES. No. 1. To draw Gravy. CUT a piece of beef into thin slices, and fry them brown in a stew-pan, with two or three onions, and two or three lean slices of bacon; then pour to it a ladle of strong broth, rubbing the brown from the pan very clean; add to it more strong broth, claret, white wine, anchovy, and a faggot of sweet herbs; season it, and stew it very well. Strain it off, and keep it for use. No. 2. To make White Gravy. Take part of a knuckle of veal, or the worst part of a neck of veal, boil about a pound of this in a quart of water, an onion, some whole pepper, six cloves, a little salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and half a nutmeg sliced; let them boil an hour, then strain off the liquor, and keep it for use. No. 3. A Gravy without Meat. Take a glass of small beer, a glass of water, an onion cut small, some pepper and salt, and a little lemon peel grated, a clove or two, a spoonful of mushroom liquor, or pickled walnut liquor; put this into a bason; then take a piece of butter, put it in a sauce-pan, and set it on the fire, that it may melt; then dredge in some flower, and stir it well till the froth sinks, and it will be brown, put in some sliced onion, then put your mixture to the brown butter and give it a boil up. No. 4. Gravy for a Turkey or Fowl. Take a pound of lean beef, cut and hack it, then flour it well, put a piece of butter as big as a hen's egg into a stew pan; when it is melted, put in your beef, fry it on all sides a little brown, then pour in three pints of boiling water, and a bundle of sweet herbs, two or three blades of mace, three or four cloves, twelve whole pepper-corns, a little bit of carrot, a little crust of bread toasted brown; cover it close, and let it boil till there is about a pint or less, then season it with salt, and strain it off. No. 5. Gravy to make Mutton eat like Venison. Take a woodcock or snipe, that is stale, (the staler the better) pick it, cut it in two, and hack it with a knife; put it into a stew-pan, with us much gravy as you shall want, and let it simmer for half an hour; then strain the gravy for use. This will give then mutton so true a flavour of game, that no one can tell it from venison. No. 6. Gravy for a Fowl, when you have no Meat ready. Take the neck, liver, and gizzard, boil them in half a pint of water, with a little piece of bread toasted brown, a little pepper and salt and a little bit of thyme. Let them boil till there is about a quarter of a pint: then pour in a glass of red wine, boil it and strain it; then bruise the liver well in, and strain it again; thicken it with a little piece of butter rolled in flour, and it will be very good. No. 7. To make a strong Fish Gravy. Take two or three eels, or any fish you have, skin or scale them, gut them and wash them from grit, cut them into little pieces, put them into a saucepan, cover them with water, a little crust of bread toasted brown, a blade or two of mace, some whole pepper, a few sweet herbs, and a little bit of lemon-peel. Let it boil till it is rich and good, then have ready a piece of butter, according to your gravy; if a pint, as big as a walnut. Melt it in the sauce-pan, shake in a little flour, and toss it about till it is brown, and then strain in the gravy to it. Let it boil a few minutes, and it will be good. No. 8. To make Essence of Ham. Take off the fat of a ham, and cut the lean in slices, beat them well, and lay them in the bottom of a sauce-pan, with slices of carrots, parsnips, and onions; cover your pan and set it over a gentle fire; let them stew till they begin to stick, then sprinkle on a little flour, and turn them; moisten them with broth and veal gravy. Season them with three or four mushrooms, as many truffles, a whole leek, some parsley, and half a dozen cloves; or instead of a leek, a clove of garlic. Put in some crumbs of bread, and let them simmer over the fire for three quarters of an hour; strain the liquor, and set it aside for use. Any pork or ham that is well cured will answer the purpose. No. 9. To make a standing Sauce. Take a quart of claret or white wine, put it in a glazed jar, with the juice of two lemons, five large anchovies, some Jamaica pepper whole, some sliced ginger, some mace, a few cloves, a little lemon-peel, horse-raddish sliced, some sweet herbs, six shallots, two spoonfuls of capers, and their liquor, put all these in a linen bag, and put it into the wine, stop it close, and set the vessel in a kettle of hot water for an hour, and keep it in a warm place. A spoonful or two of this liquor is good in any sauce. No. 10. To make Sauce for roasted Meat. Take an anchovy, wash it it very clean, and put to it a glass of red wine, a little strong broth or gravy, some nutmeg, one shallot shred and the juice of a Seville orange; stew these together a little, and pour it to the gravy that runs from your meat. No. 11. To make sauce for Savoury Pies. Take some gravy, some anchovy, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a little mushroom liquor; boil it a little, and thicken it with burnt butter; then add a little claret, open your pie, and put it in. This serves for mutton, lamb, veal, or beef pies. No. 12. To make Sauce for a sweet Pie. Take some white wine, a little lemon juice, or verjuice, and some sugar; boil it, then beat two eggs, and mix them well together; then open your pie, and pour it in. This may be used for veal or lamb pies. No. 13. To make Sauce for Fish Pies. Take claret, white wine and vinegar, oyster liquor, anchovies, and drawn butter; when the pies are baked, pour it in with a funnel. No. 14. To melt Butter Thick. Your saucepan must be well tinned, and very clean. Just moisten the bottom with as small a quantity of water as possible; not above a spoonful to half a pound of butter. You may or may not dust the butter with flour; it is better not to flour it. Cut the butter in slices, and put it into the pan a little before the water becomes hot. As it melts, keep the pan shaking one way frequently, and when it is all melted let it boil up, and it will be smooth, fine, and thick. No. 15. To burn Butter. Put two ounces of butter over a slow fire, in a stew-pan or sauce-pan, without water. When the butter is melted, dust on a little flour, and keep it stirring till it grows thick and brown. No. 16. To make Mushroom Sauce for White Fowls. Take a pint of mushrooms, wash and pick them very clean, and put them into a saucepan, with a little salt, some nutmeg, a blade of mace, a pint of cream, and a good piece of butter rolled in flour. Boil these all together and keep stirring them; then pour your sauce into the dish, and garnish with lemon. No. 17. Mushroom Sauce for White Fowls boiled. Take half a pint of cream, and a quarter of a pound of butter, stir them together one way till it is thick; then add a spoonful of mushroom pickle, pickled mushrooms, or fresh if you have them. Garnish only with lemon. No. 18. To make Celery Sauce, for roasted or boiled Fowls, Turkies, Partridges, or other Game. Take a large bunch of celery, wash and pare it very clean, cut it into little thin bits, and boil it softly in a little water till it is tender; then add a little beaten mace, some nutmeg, pepper and salt, thickened with a good piece of butter rolled in flour; then boil it up, and pour it in the dish. No. 19. To make brown Celery Sauce. Stew the celery as above, then add mace, nutmeg, pepper, salt, a piece of butter rolled in flour, with a glass of red wine, a spoonful of catchup, and half a pint of good gravy; boil all these together, and pour into the dish. Garnish with lemon. No. 20. To make Egg Sauce for roasted Chickens. Melt your butter thick and fine, chop two or three hard-boiled eggs fine, put them into a bason, pour the butter over them, and have good gravy in the dish. No. 21. Shallot Sauce for roasted Fowls. Take five or six shallots, peel and cut small, put them into a sauce-pan, with two spoonfuls of white wine, two of water, and two of vinegar; give them a boil up, and pour them into the dish, with a little pepper and salt. Fowls laid on water-cresses are very good without any other sauce. No. 22. Shallot Sauce for a Scrag of Mutton boiled. Take two spoonfuls of the liquor the mutton is boiled in, two spoonfuls of vinegar, two or three shallots cut fine, with a little salt; put it into a sauce-pan, with a piece of butter as big as a walnut, rolled in a little flour; stir it together, and give it a boil. For those who love shallots, it is the prettiest sauce that can be made to a scrag of mutton. No. 23. To make Lemon Sauce for boiled Fowls. Take a lemon, pare off the rhind then cut it into slices, cut it small, and take all the kernels out; bruise the liver with two or three spoonfuls of good gravy, then melt some butter, mix all together, give them a boil, and cut in a little lemon-peel very small. No. 24. A pretty Sauce for a boiled Fowl. Take the liver of the fowl, bruise it with a little of the liquor, cut a little lemon-peel fine, melt some good butter, and mix the liver by degrees; give it a boil, and pour it into the dish. No. 25. To make Onion Sauce. Boil some large onions in a good deal of water, till they are very tender; put them into a cullender, and when drained, pass them through it with a spoon; put them into a clean saucepan, with a good piece of butter, a little salt, and a gill of cream: Stir them over the fire till they are of a good thickness. No. 26. To make Apple Sauce. Take as many boiling apples as you chuse, peel them, and take out all the cores; put them in a sauce-pan with a little water, a few cloves, and a blade of mace; simmer them till quite soft. Then strain off all the water, and beat them up with a little brown sugar and butter. No. 27. Bread, or Pap-sauce. Take a pint of water, put in a good piece of crumb of bread, a blade of mace, and a little whole pepper; boil it for eight or ten minutes, and then pour the water off; take out out the spice, and beat up the bread with a little butter. No. 28. Mint Sauce. Take young mint, pick and wash it clean; then shred it fine, put it into a small bason sprinkle it well with sugar, and pour in vinegar to your palate. No. 29. Parsley Sauce. Tie parsley up in a bunch, and boil it till soft; shred it fine, and mix it with melted butter. No. 30. To make Parsley Sauce in Winter, when there is no Parsley to be got. Take a little parsley-seed, tie it up in a clean rag, and boil it for ten minutes in a sauce-pan; then take out the seeds, and let the water cool a little. Take as much of the liquor as you want, dredge in a little flour, and then put in your butter and melt it. Shred a little boiled spinach, and put it in also; and pour it into a boat. No. 31. To make Lobster sauce. Take a lobster, bruise the body and spawn that is in the inside very fine, with the back of a spoon; mince the meat of the tail and claws very small, melt your butter of a good thickness, put in the bruised part, and shake it well together; then put in the minced meat, with a little nutmeg grated, and a spoonful of white wine; let it just boil up, and pour it into boats, or over your fish. No. 32. To make Shrimp sauce. Put half a pint of shrimps, clean picked, into a gill of good gravy; let it boil with a lump of butter rolled in flour, and a spoonful of red wine. No. 33. To make Oyster sauce. Take a pint of oysters that are tolerably large; put them into a saucepan with their own liquor, a blade of mace, a little whole pepper, and a bit of lemon-peel; let them stew over the fire till the oysters are plump; pour all into a clean pan, and wash them carefully one by one, out of the liquor; strain about a gill of the liquor through a fine sieve, and the same quantity of good gravy, cut half a pound of fresh butter in pieces, roll up some in flour, and then put in all to your oysters; set it over the fire, shake it round often till it boil, and add a spoonful of white wine; let it just boil, and pour it into your bason or boat.--Many people add an anchouy, which greatly enriches the sauce. No. 34. To make Anchovy sauce. Strip an anchovy, bruise it very fine, put it into half a pint of gravy, a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, a spoonful of red wine, and a tea spoonful of catchup; boil all together till it is properly thick, and serve it up.

Take half a pint of water, two anchovies split, a clove, a bit of mace, a little lemon-peel, a few pepper corns, and a large spoonful of red wine; boil all together, till your anchovy is dissolved; then strain it off, and thicken it with butter rolled in flour. This is the best sauce for skate, maids, or thornback. N. B. For other particular Sauces see the receipts for different dishes. OF ROASTING. General Rules to be observed in Roasting. YOUR fire must be made in proportion to the piece you are to dress; that is, if it be a little or thin piece, make a small brisk fire, that it may be done quick and nice; but if a large joint, observe to lay a good fire to cake, and let it be always clear at the bottom. Alalowing a quarter of an hour for every pound of meat at a steady fire, your expectations will hardly ever fail, from a sirloin of beef to a small joint: nevertheless, I shall mention some few observations as to Beef, Mutton, Lamb, Veal, Pork, &c. BUTCHER'S MEAT. To Roast Beef. If it be a sirloin or chump, butter a piece of writing-paper, and fasten it on the back of your meat with small skewers, aad lay it down to a soaking fire, at a proper distance. As soon as your meat is warm, dust on some flour, and baste it with butter; then sprinkle some salt, and, at times, baste it with what comes from it. About a quarter of an hour before you take it up, remove the paper, dust on a little flour, and baste it with a piece of butter, that it may go to table with a good froth. Garnish your dish with scraped horse-radish, and serve it up with potatoes, brocoli, French beans, cauliflower, or celery. To roast Mutton. If a chine, or saddle of mutton, let the skin be raised, and then skewered on again; this will prevent it from scorching, and make it eat mellow: a quarter of an hour before you take it up, take off the skin, dust on some flour, baste it with butter and sprinkle on a little salt. As the chine, saddle, and leg, are the largest joints, they require a stronger fire than the shoulder, neck or loin. Garnish with scraped horse-raddish; and serve it up with potatoes, brocoli, French beans, cauliflower, water-cresses, horse-radish, pickled cabbage, and other pickles. Serve up a shoulder of mutton, with onion sauce.-- See the sauce Articles, No. 25. To roast Mutton Venison Fashion. Take a hind quarter of fat mutton, and cut the legs like a haunch; lay it in a pan with the back side of it down; pour a bottle of red wine over it, and let it lie twenty-four hours; then spit it, and baste it with the same liquor and butter all the time it is roasting, at a good quick fire, and two hours and a half will do it. Have a little good gravy in a boat, and currant jelly in another.-- See No. 1, or No. 5. -- A good fat neck of mutton eats finely done thus. A Shoulder or Leg of Mutton stuffed. Stuff a leg of mutton with mutton suet, salt, pepper, nutmeg, grated bread, and yolks of eggs; then stick it all over with cloves, and roast it; when it is about half done, cut off some of the under-side of the fleshy end in little bits; put those into a pipkin with a pint of oysters, liquor and all, a little salt and mace, and half a pint of hot water; stew them till half the liquor is wasted, then put in a piece of butter rolled in flour, shake all together, and when the mutton is enough, take it up; pour the sauce over it, and send it to table. To roast a Breast of Mutton with Forc'd-meat. A breast of mutton dressed thus is very good; the forc'd-meat must be put under the skin at the end, and then the skin pinned down with thorns; before you dredge it wash it over with a bunch of feathers dipt in eggs. Garnish with lemon; and put good gravy in the dish.--The force-meat may be the same as in the last receipt. To roast a Tongue, or Udder. Parboil it first, then roast it: stick eight or ten cloves about it; baste it with butter, and send it up with gravy and sweet sauce. An udder eats very well done the same way. To roast Lamb. Lay it down to a clear good fire that will want little stirring; then baste it with butter, and dust on a little flour; baste it with what falls from it; and a little before you take it up baste it again with butter, and sprinkle on a little salt, and parsley shred fine. Send it up to table with a nice sallad, mint sauce, green peas, French beans, or cauliflower.----- See sauce, No. 28. To roast Veal. When you roast the loin or fillet, paper the udder of the fillet to preserve the fat, and the back of the loin to prevent it from scorching; lay the meat at first some distance from the fire, that it may soak; baste it well with butter, then dust on a little flour. When it has soaked some time, draw it near the fire: and a little before you take it up, baste it again. Most people chuse to stuff a fillet. The breast you must roast with the caul on, and the sweet-bread skewered on the back-side. When it is near enough, take off the caul, and baste it with butter. It is proper to have a toast nicely baked, and laid in the dish with a loin of veal, garnish with lemon and barberries. The stuffing of a fillet of veal is made in the following manner: take about a pound of grated bread, half a pound of suet, some parsley shred fine, thime , marjoram, or savory, which you like best, a little grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, pepper and salt, and mix these well together with whites and yolks of eggs. To roast Pork. Pork requires more doing than any other meat; and it is best to sprinkle it with a little salt the night before you use it, (except on the rind, which must never be salted) and hang it up; by that means it will take off the faint, sickly taste. When you roast a chine of Pork, lay it down to a good fire, and at a proper distance, that it may be well soaked. A spare-rib is to be roasted with a fire that is not too strong, but clear; when you lay it down, dust on some flour, and baste it with butter: a quarter of an hour before you take it up, shred some sage small; baste your pork, strew on the sage, dust on a little flour, and sprinkle a little salt before you take it up. A loin must be cut on the skin in small streaks, and then basted, but put no flour on, which would make the skin blister: Be careful that it is jointed before you lay it down to the fire. A leg of Pork is often roasted with sage and onion shred fine, with a little pepper and salt, and stuffed at the knuckle; with gravy in the dish: But a better way is this: parboil it first, and take off the skin; lay it down to a good clear fire, baste it with butter, then shred some sage fine and mix it with pepper, salt, nutmeg; and bread crumbs; strew this over it whilst it is roasting; Baste it again with butter just before you take it up, that it may be of a fine brown, and have a nice froth: send up some good gravy in the dish, and serve it up with apple sauce and pototoes. -- See sauce, No. 26. To stuff a Chine of Pork. Make a stuffing of the fat leaf of pork, parsley, thyme, sage, eggs, and crumbs of bread, season it with pepper, salt, shallotes and nutmeg, and stuff it thick; then roast it gently, and when it is about a quarter roasted, cut the skin in slips. Serve it up with apple sauce as in the foregoing receipt. To roast a Pig. Spit your pig, and lay it down to a clear fire, kept good at both ends: Put into the belly a few sage leaves, a little pepper and salt, a small crust of bread, and a bit of butter: then sew up the belly: flour it all over very well, and do so till the eyes begin to start. When you find the skin is tight and crisp, and the eyes are dropped, put two plates into the dripping pan, to save what gravy comes from it: put a quarter of a pound of butter into a clean coarse cloth, and rub all over it till the flour is quite taken off; then take it up into your dish, take the sage, &c. out of the belly and chop it small; cut off the head, open it, and take out the brains, which chop, and put the sage and brains into half a pint of good gravy, with a piece of butter rolled in flour; then cut your pig down the back, and lay it flat in the dish: Cut off the two ears, and lay one upon each shoulder; take off the under jaw, cut it in two, and lay one upon each side; put the head between the shoulders; pour the gravy out of the plates into your sauce, and then into the dish; send it up to table garnished with lemon, and if you please, pap sauce in a bason. See sauce, No. 27. GAME AND POULTRY. To roast Venison. After the haunch of venison is spitted, take a piece of butter, and rub all over the dust on a little flour, and sprinkle a little salt: then take a sheet of writing paper, butter it well, and lay over the fat part; put two sheets over that, and tie the paper on with small twine: Keep it well basted, and let there be a good soaking fire. If a large haunch, it will take near three hours to do it. Five minutes before you send it to table, take off the paper, dust it over with a little flour, and baste it with butter, let it go up with a good froth; put no gravy in the dish, but send it in one boat, and currant jelly melted in another. To roast a Hare. Case and truss your hare, and then make a pudding thus: A quarter of a pound of beef suet minced fine; as much bread crumbs; the liver chopped fine; parsley and lemon-peel shred fine, seasoned with pepper salt, and nutmeg. Moisten it with an egg, and put it into the hare, sew up the belly, and lay it down to a good fire: Let your dripping pan be very clean; put into it a quart of milk, and six ounces of butter, and baste it with this till the whole is used: about five minutes before you take it up, dust on a little flour, and baste with fresh butter, that it may go to table with a good froth. Put a little gravy in the dish, and the rest in a boat: Garnish your dish with lemon. -- See gravy, No. 1, or No. 4. To roast Rabbits. Baste them with good butter, and dredge them with a little flour. Half an hour will do them, at a very quick clear fire; and if they are very small, twenty minutes will do them. Take the livers with a little bunch of parsley, and boil them, and then chop them very fine together. Melt some good butter, and put half the liver and parsley into the butter; pour it into the dish, and garnish the dish with the other half. Let the rabbits be done of a fine light brown. To roast a Rabbit Hare fashion. Lard a rabbit with bacon; put a pudding in its belly, and roast it as you do a hare, and it eats very well. Send it up with gravy sauce.-- See gravy, No. 1, or No. 4. To roast a Turkey, Goose, Duck, Fowl, &c. When you roast a turkey, goose, fowl, or chicken, lay them down to a good fire. Singe them clean with white paper, baste them with butter, and dust on some flour. As to time, a large turkey will take an hour and twenty mintues; a middling one a full hour; a full grown goose, if young, an hour; a large fowl three quarters of an hour; a middling one half an hour, and a small chicken twenty minutes; but this depends entirely on the goodness of your fire. When your fowls are thoroughly plump, and the smoke draws from the breast to the fire, you may be sure that they are very near done. Then baste them with butter; dust on a very little flour, and as soon as they have a good froth, serve them up. Geese and ducks are commonly seasoned with onions, sage, and a little pepper and salt. A turkey when roasted, is generally stuffed in the craw with forc'd-meat, or the following stuffing: Take a pound of veal, as much grated bread, half a pound of suet cut and beat very fine, a little parsley, with a small matter of thyme, or savory, two cloves, half a nutmeg grated, a tea-spoonful of shred lemon-peel, a little pepper and salt, and the yolks of two eggs. Sauce for a turkey. Good gravy in a boat; and either bread, onion, or oyster sauce in a bason.-- See gravy, No. 1, and No, 4. -- sauce No. 25, No. 27, and No. 33. Sauce for a Goose. --A little good gravy in a boat, apple sauce in a bason, and mustard.-- See sauce, No. 26. For a Duck.

I. A Fowl or Turkey roasted with Chestnuts. Roast a quarter of a hundred of chesnuts, and peel them; save out eight or ten, the rest bruise in a mortar, with a liver of a fowl, a quarter of a pound of ham well pounded, and sweet herbs and parsley chopped fine: Season it with mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt: mix all these together, and put them into the belly of your fowl: Spit it, and tie the neck and vent close. For sauce, take the rest of the chesnuts, cut them in pieces, and put them into a strong gravy, with a glass of white wine: thicken with a piece of butter rolled in flour. Pour the sauce in the dish, and garnish with orange and water-cresses. To roast a green Goose with green sauce. Roast your goose nicely; in the mean time, make your sauce thus: take half a pint of the juice of sorrel, a spoonful of white wine, a little grated nutmeg, and some grated bread; boil this over a gentle fire, and sweeten it with pounded sugar to your taste; let your goose have a good froth on it before you take it up; put some good strong gravy in the dish, and the same in a boat. Garnish with lemon. The German way of dressing Fowls. Take a turkey or fowl, stuff the breast with what force-meat you like, fill the body with roasted chesnuts peeled, and lay it down to roast: take half a pint of good gravy, with a little piece of butter rolled in flour; boil these together with some small turnips and sausages cut in slices, and fried or broiled. Garnish with chesnuts. Note. You may dress ducks the same way. To roast Pigeons. Take a little pepper and salt, a small piece of butter, and some parsley cut small; mix these together, put them into the bellies of your pigeons, tying the neck ends tight; take another string, fasten one end of it to their legs and rumps, and the other to the mantle-piece. Keep them constantly turning round, and baste them with butter. When they are done, take them up, lay them in a dish, and they will swim with gravy. Wild Ducks, Widgeons, or Teals. Wild fowl are in general liked rather under done: and if your fire is very good and brisk, a duck or widgeon will be done in a quarter of an hour; for as soon as they are well hot through they begin to lose their gravy and if not drawn off, will eat hard. A teal is done in little more than ten minutes. To roast Woodcocks or Snipes. Spit them on a small bird spit; flour them, and baste them with butter: have ready a slice of bread toasted brown, which lay in a dish, and set it under your birds, for the trail to drop on. When they are enough, take them up, and lay them on the toast; put some good gravy in the dish, and some melted butter in a cup. Garnish with orange or lemon. To roast Quails. Truss them, and stuff their bellies with beef suet and sweet herbs shred very fine, and seasoned with a little spice: When they grow warm, baste them with salt and water, then dredge them, and baste them with butter. For sauce, dissolve, an anchovy in good gravy, with two or three shallots shred very fine and the juice of a Seville orange; dish them up in this sauce, and garnish your dish with fried bread crumbs, and lemon; send them to table as hot as possible. To roast Pheasants. Take a brace of pheasants, lard them with small lards of bacon: butter a piece of white paper, and put over the breasts, and about ten minutes before they are done take off the paper; flour and baste them with nice butter, that they may go to table with a fine froth: Put good gravy in the dish, and bread sauce, as for partridges, in a boat; garnish your dish with lemon. -- See sauce, No. 27. To roast Partridges. When they are a little under-roasted, dredge them with flour, and baste them with fresh butter: let them go to table with a fine froth, putting gravy sauce in the dish, and bread sauce in a bason.-- See sauce, No. 27. To roast Plovers. Green Plovers are roasted as you do wood-cocks: lay them upon a toast, and put good gravy sauce in the dish. Grey plovers are toasted, or stewed, thus: Make a force-meat of artichoke bottoms cut small, seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg: Stuff the bellies, and put the birds into a saucepan, with a good gravy just to cover them, a glass of white wine, and a blade of mace; cover them close, and stew them softly till they are tender; then take up your plovers into the dish; put in a piece of butter rolled in flour, to thicken your sauce; let it boil till smooth; squeeze in a little lemon; scum it clean, and pour it over the birds. Garnish with orange. To roast Larks. Truss your larks with the legs across, and put a sage leaf over the breast; put them upon a long fine skewer, and between every lark a little piece of thin bacon: then tie the skewer to a spit, and roast them at a quick clear fire; baste them with butter, and strew over them some crumbs of bread, mixed with flour; fry some bread crumbs of a nice brown, in a bit of butter; lay your larks round in your dish, the bread crumbs in the middle, with sliced orange for garnish. Send good gravy in a boat. To roast Ortolans. You may lard them with bacon, or roast them without, putting a vine-leaf between each; spit them sideways, baste them with butter, and strew bread crumbs on them while roasting; Send them to table with fried bread crumbs around them, garnished with lemon, and a good gravy sauce in a boat. To dress Ruffs and Riefs. Draw them, and truss them cross-legged, as you do snipes, and spit them the same way; lay them upon a buttered toast, pour good gravy into the dish, and serve them up quick. OF FISH. To roast a Cod's Head. Wash and scour the head very clean, scotch it with a knife, strew a little salt on it, and lay it before the fire; throw away the water that runs from it the first half hour, then strew on it some nutmeg, cloves, mace, and salt, and baste it often with butter. Take all the gravy of the fish, white wine and meat gravy, some horse-raddish, shallots, whole pepper, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and a bay-leaf or two: boil this liquor up with butter, and the liver of the fish boiled, broke, and strained into it, with the yolks of two or three eggs, oysters, shrimps, and balls made of fish; put fried fish round it. Garnish with lemon and horse- radish. --Or you may use the sauce, No. 31, or either of the four following Numbers, which ever is most agreeable. To roast a Pike. Take a large pike, gut it, clean it, and lard it with eel and bacon, as you lard fowl; then take thyme, savory, salt, mace, nutmeg, some crumbs of bread, beef suet, and parsley, all shred very fine, and mix it up with raw eggs; make it into a long pudding, and put it in the belly of your pike: sew up the belly, and dissolve three anchovies in butter, to baste it with; put two laths on each side the pike, and tie it to the spit: Melt butter thick for the sauce, (or if you please, oyster sauce) and bruise the pudding into it. Garnish with lemon. -- See sauce, No. 33. To roast an Eel. Scour the eel well with salt; skin him almost to the tail; then gut, wash, and dry him; Take a quarter of a pound of suet shred as fine as possible, sweet herbs, and a shallot, and mix them together with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; scotch your eel on both sides, wash it with yolks of eggs, lay some seasoning over it, stuff the belly with it, then draw the skin over it, and tie it to the spit; baste it with butter, and make the sauce of anchovies and butter, melted.-- See sauce, No. 34, or 35. Any other river or sea fish, that are large enough, may be dressed in the same manner. CHAP. III. OF BOILING. General Rules to be observed in Boiling. BE very careful that your pots and covers are well tinned, very clean, and free from sand. Mind that your pot really boils all the while; otherwise you will be disappointed in dressing any joint, though it has been a proper time over the fire. Fresh meat should be put in when the water boils, and salt meat whilst it is cold. Take care likewise to have sufficient room and water in the pot, and allow a quarter of an hour to every pound of meat, let it weigh more or less. BUTCHER'S MEAT. To boil Beef or Mutton. When your meat is put in, and the pot boils, take care to scum it very clean, otherwise the scum will boil down, stick to your meat, and make it look black. Send up your dish with turnips, greens, potatoes, or carrots. If it is a leg or loin of mutton, you may also put melted butter and capers in a boat. To boil a Leg of Pork. A leg of pork must lie in salt six or seven days; after which put it into the pot to be boiled, without using any means to freshen it. It requires much water to swim in over the fire, and also to be fully boiled; so that care should be taken that the fire do not slacken while it is dressing. Serve it up with a pease-pudding, melted butter, mustard, buttered turnips, carrots, or greens. N. B. The other joints of the swine are most commonly roasted. To boil Pickled Pork. Wash the pork and scrape it clean. Put it in when the water is cold, and boil it till the rhind be tender. It is to be served up always with boiled greens, and is commonly a sauce of itself to roasted fowls or veal. To boil Veal. Let the pot boil, and have a good fire when you put in the meat; be sure to scum it very clean. A knuckle of veal will take more boilink in proportion to its weight, than any other joint, because the beauty is to have all the gristles soft and tender. You may either send up boiled veal with parsley and butter: or with bacon and greens.-- See sauce, No. 29. To boil a Calf's Head. The head must be picked very clean, and soaked in a large pan of water a considerable time before it is put into the pot. Tie the brains up in a rag, and put them into the pot at the same time with the head; scum the pot well; then put in a piece of bacon, in proportion to the number of people to eat thereof. You will find it to be enough by the tenderness of the flesh about that part that joined to the neck. When enough, you may grill it before the fire, or serve it up with melted butter, bacon, and greens; and with the brains mashed and beat up with a little butter, salt, pepper, vinegar, or lemon, sage, and parsley, in a separate plate, and the tongue slit and laid in the same plate, or serve the brains whole, and the tongue slit down the middle. To boil Lamb. A leg of Lamb of five pounds will not be boiled in less than an hour and a quarter; and if, as it ought to be, it is boiled in a good deal of water, and your pot be kept clean scum'd, you may dish it up as white as a curd. Send it to table with stewed spinach; and melted butter in a boat. To boil a Neat's Tongue. A dried tongue should be soaked over night; when you dress it, put it into cold water, and let it have room; it will take at least four hours. A green tongue out of the pickle need not be soaked, but it will require near the same time. An hour before you dish it up, take it out and blanch it, then put it into the pot again till you want it; this will make it eat the tenderer. To boil a Ham. A ham requires a great deal of water, therefore put it into the copper cold, and let it only simmer for two hours, and allow a full quarter of an hour to every pound of ham; by this means your ham will eat tender and well. A dry ham should be soaked in water overnight; a green one does not require soaking. Take care they are well cleaned before you dress them. Before you send a ham to table take off the rind, and sprinkle it over with bread crumbs, and put it in an oven for a quarter of an hour: or you may crisp it with a hot salamander. To boil a Haunch of Venison. Salt the haunch well, and let it lay a week; then boil it with a cauliflower, some turnips, young cabbages, and beet-roots; lay your venison in the dish, dispose the garden things round it in separate plates, and send it to table. GAME AND POULTRY. To boil a Turkey, Fowl, Goose, Duck, &c. Poultry are first boiled by themselves, and in a good deal of water; scum the pot clean, and you need not be afraid of their going to table of a bad colour. A large Turkey, with a force-meat in his craw, will take two hours: one without, an hour and a half; a hen turkey, three quarters of an hour; a large fowl, forty minutes; a small one, half an hour; a large chicken, twenty minutes; and a small one a quarter of an hour. A full grown goose salted, an hour and a half; a large duck, near an hour. Sauce for a boiled Turkey. Take a little water, a bit of thyme, an onion, a blade of mace, a little lemon-peel, and an anchovy: boil these together and strain them through a sieve, adding a little melted butter. Fry a few sausages to lay round the dish, and garnish with lemon. --Or you may use the Gravy, No. 4, or the Oyster sauce, No. 33, made with white gravy. Sauce for a Fowl. Parsley and butter; or white oyster sauce.-- See sauce, No. 33, or No. 17. Sauce for a Goose. Onions, or cabbage, first boiled, and then stewed in butter for a few minutes.-- See sauce, No. 26. Sauce for a Duck. They should be smothered in onions. -- See sauce, No. 25. For Poultry there is also a variety of other sauces among the sauce articles. Chickens boiled, with Celery sauce. Put two fine chickens into a sauce-pan to boil, and in the mean time prepare the sauce; take the white part of two bunches of celery, cut about an inch and a half long, and boil it till tender; strain off the water, and put the celery into a stew-pan, with half a pint of cream, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; season with pepper and salt; set it over a clear fire, and keep it stirring till it is smooth, and of a good thickness. Have ready half a dozen rashers of bacon; take up your chickens, pour your sauce into the dish, and put the rashers of bacon and sliced lemon round. To boil Pigeon. Let the Pigeons be boiled by themselves for about a quarter of an hour; then boil a proper quantity of bacon, cut square, and lay it in the middle of the dish. Stew some spinach to put round, and lay the pigeons on the spinach. Garnish with parsley dried crisp before the fire. To boil Rabbits. Truss your rabbits close, and boil them off white. For sauce, take the livers, which, when boiled, bruise with a spoon very fine, and take out all the strings; put to this some good veal broth, a little parsley shred fine, and some barberries clean pick'd from the stalks; season it with mace and nutmeg; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour; and a little white wine. Let your sauce be of a good thickness, and pour it over your rabbits. Garnish with lemons and barberries. To boil Rabbits with Onions. Truss your rabbits short, with the heads turned over their shoulders: Let them be boiled off very white. Serve them up with the Onion sauce, No. 25, and garnish with lemon and raw parsley. To boil Woodcocks or Snipes. Boil them either in beef gravy, or good strong broth made in the best manner; put your gravy, when made to your mind, into a sauce-pan, and season it with salt; take the guts of your snipes out clean, and put them into your gravy, and let them boil; let them be covered close, and kept boiling, and then ten minutes will be sufficient. In the mean time, cut the guts and liver small. Take a small quantity of the liquor your snipes are boiled in, and stew the guts with a blade of mace. Take some crumbs of bread, (about the quantity of the inside of a stale roll) and have them ready fried crisp in a little fresh butter; when they are done, let them stand ready in a plate before the fire. When your snipes or woodcocks are ready, take about half a pint of the liquor they are boiled in, and put two spoonfuls of red wine to the guts, and a lump of butter rolled in flour, about as big as a walnut; set them on the fire in a sauce-pan. Never stir it with a spoon, but shake it well till the butter is melted; then put in your crumbs; shake your sauce-pan well; take your birds up, and pour your sauce over them. To boil Pheasants. Let them be dressed in a good deal of water; if large three quarters of an hour will do them: if small, half an hour. For sauce, use stewed celery, thickened with cream, and a piece of butter rolled in flour, a little salt, grated nutmeg, and a spoonful of white wine; pour the sauce over them; and garnish with orange cut in quarters. To boil Partridges. Boil them quick and in a good deal of water; a quarter of an hour will do them. For Sauce. Parboil the livers, and scald some parsley: Chop these fine, and put them into some melted butter; squeeze in a little lemon, give it a boil up, and pour it over the birds. Garnish with lemon. But this is a more elegant sauce: Take a few mushrooms, fresh peeled, and wash them clean, put them in a sauce-pan with a little salt, set them over a quick fire, let them boil up, and put in a quarter of a pint of cream, and a little nutmeg; shake them together with a very little piece of butter rolled in flour, give it two or three shakes over the fire, (three or four minutes will do) then pour it over the birds. OF FISH. To boil a Turbot. A turbot ought to be put into pump water, with salt and vinegar, for two hours before it is dressed. In the mean time put a sufficiency of water into a fish kettle, with a stick of horse radish sliced, a handful of salt, and a faggot of sweet herbs. When the water tastes of the seasoning, take it off the fire, and let it cool a little to prevent the fish from breaking. Put a handful of salt into the mouth and belly of the turbot, put it into the kettle, and boil it gently. A middling turbot will take about twenty minutes. When it is enough, drain it a little; lay it upon a dish sufficiently large, and garnish with fried smelts, sliced lemon, scraped horse-radish, and barberries. Sauce. Lobster sauce, anchovy sauce, and plain butter, in separate basons.-- See sauce No. 31, and No. 34, 35. To boil a Cod. Gut and wash the fish very clean inside and out, and rub the back bone with a handful of salt; put it upon a fish plate, and boil it gently till it is enough; and remember always to boil the liver along with it. Garnish with scraped horse-radish, small fried fish, and sliced lemon. Sauce. Oyster sauce, shrimp sauce, or lobster sauce, with plain melted butter, in different boats, and mustard in a tea-cup.-- See sauce, No. 31, and No. 34, 35. To boil a Cod's Head. After tying your cod's head round with packthread, to keep it from flying, put a fish-kettle on the fire, large enough to cover it with a little water; put in some salt, vinegar, and some horse-radish sliced; when your water boils, lay your fish upon a drainer, and put it into the kettle; let it boil gently till it rises to the surface of the water, which it will do, if your kettle is large enough: then take it out, and set it to drain: slide it carefully off your drainer into your fish plate. Garnish with lemon, and hore-radish scraped. Have oyster sauce in one bason, and shrimp sauce in another.-- See sauce, No, 32, or 33. To boil Crimp Cod. Cut a cod into slices, and throw it into pump-water and salt; set over your stove a large fish kettle, or turbot pan, almost full of spring water, and salt sufficient to make it brackish: let it boil quick, then put in your slice of cod, and keep it boiling and clean scumm'd; in about eight minutes the fish will be enough; then take the slices carefully up, and lay them on a fish-plate. Garnish your dish with horse-radish, lemon, and green parsley. Send shrimp sauce in one boat, and oyster sauce in another.-- See sauce, No. 32, or 33. You may if you please, take some of the largest slices, flour them, and broil them to a fine brown, and send them in a dish for the lower end of the table. To boil Skate. Great care must be taken in cleaning this fish; and as it is commonly too large to be boiled in a pan at once, the best way is to cut it in long slips, cross-ways, about an inch broad, and throw it into salt and water; and if the water boils quick it will be enough in three minutes. Drain it well and serve it up with butter and mustard in one bason, and anchovy or soy sauce in another.-- See sauce, No. 34, or No. 35. You may, if you please, place spitchcock'd eels round about the skate. To boil Soals. Clean the soals well, and having laid them two hours in vinegar, salt and water, dry them in a cloth, and then put them into a fish-pan with an onion, some whole pepper, and a little salt. Cover the pan, and let them boil till enough. Serve them up with anchovy sauce, and butter melted plain; or with shrimp, soy, or muscle sauce. -- See sauce, No. 31, 32, or 34, 35. To boil Plaice and Flounders. Let the pan boil; throw some salt into the water; then put in the fish; and (being boiled enough) take it out with a slice, and drain it well. Serve it up with horse-radish and boiled parsley, to garnish the edges of the dish; and with a bason of butter melted plain, and anchovy sauce; or butter melted with a little catchup or soy. -- See sauce, No. 34, or 35. To boil Sturgeon. Having cleaned the sturgeon well, boil it in as much liquor as will just cover it, adding two or three bits of lemon-peel, some whole pepper, a stick of horse-radish and a pint of vinegar to every two quarts of water. When it is enough, garnish the dish with fried oysters, sliced lemon, and scraped horse-raddish, serve it up with a sufficient quantity of melted fresh butter, with a cavear dissolved in it; or (where that is not to be had) with anchovy sauce, and the body of a crab bruised in the butter, and a little lemon juice served up in basons. To boil Salmon. Let it be well scraped and cleansed from scales and blood: and after it has lain about an hour in salt and spring-water, put it into a fish-kettle, with a proportionate quantity of salt and horse-radish, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Put it in while the water is lukewarm, and boil it gently till enough, or about half an hour, if it be thick; or twenty minutes if it be a small piece. Pour off the water, dry it well, and dish it neatly upon a fish-plate, in the center, and garnish the dish with horse-radish scraped, (as done for roast beef,) or with fried smelts or gudgeons, and with slices of lemon round the rim. The sauce to be melted butter, with and without anchovy; or shrimp or lobster sauce in different basons.-- See sauce, No. 31, or 32. To boil Carp. Take a brace of large carp, scale them, and slit the tails, let them bleed into about half a pint of red wine, with half a nutmeg grated; (keep it stirring, or the blood will congeal) then gut and wash them very clean; boil the roes first, and then the carp, as you would do any other fish, then fry them; fry some sippets cut corner-ways; and lastly, dip some large oysters in batter, and fry them also of a fine brown. For the sauce, take two anchovies, a piece of lemon-peel, a little horse-radish, and a bit of onion, boil these in water till the anchovies are wasted; strain the liquor into a clean saucepan, and, as you like it, add oysters stewed, a lobster cut small, (without the spawn,) crawfish, or shrimps; set it over the fire, and let it boil; then take near a pound of butter, roll a good piece in flour, put it into your saucepan with the liquor, with what other ingredients you intend, and boil all together, till it is good thickness; then pour in the wine and blood, and shake it about, letting it only simmer. Take up the fish, put them into a dish, and pour the sauce over them. Garnish your dish with fried oysters, horse-radish, fried parsley, and lemon; stick the sippets about the dish, and lay the roe, some on the fish and the rest on the dish; send it to table as hot as you can. As this is an expensive method, you may if you please, dress carp according to the following receipt of dressing tench. To boil Tench. Clean your tench very well, then put them into a stew-pan, with as much water as will cover them; put in some salt, whole pepper, lemon-peel, horse-radish, and a bundle of sweet herbs, and boil them till they are enough. For sauce. --Take some of the liquor, a glass of white wine, a pint of shrimps, and an anchovy bruised; boil all together in a sauce-pan, and roll a good piece of butter in flour, and break it into the sauce; when of a proper thickness, pour it over the fish. Garnish with lemon and scraped horse-radish. To boil Mackrel. Having cleaned the mackrel well, and soaked them for some time in spring water, put them and the roes into a stew-pan, with as much water as will cover them, and a little salt. Boil a small bunch of fennel along with them, and when you send them up, garnish with the roes, and the fennel shred fine. Sauce. -- Grated sugar in a saucer; melted butter, and green gooseberries boiled, in different basons; or, parsley and butter with a little vinegar or lemon. To boil Eels. Having skinned and washed your eels, and cut off the back skins with a pair of scissars, roll them round with their heads innermost, and run a strong skewer through them. Put them into a stew-pan, with a sufficient quantity of water, and a little vinegar and salt. Garnish with sliced lemon. Sauce -- Parsley and butter. To boil a Pike, or Jack. Gut and clean your pike very well with salt and water, fasten the tail in the mouth with skewer, then put it into a stew-pan, with as much water as will cover it, a little vinegar and salt, and a piece of horse-radish sliced. Garnish with sliced lemon, and scraped horse-radish. Sauce. --Anchovy, shrimp, or soy sauce; or melted butter and catchup. -- See sauce, No. 32, or 34. To dress a Turtle. Fill a boiler or kettle with a quantity of water sufficient to scald the callapach and callapee, the fins, &c. And about nine o'clock hang up your turtle by the hind fins, cut off its head, and save the blood; then with a sharp-pointed knife separate the callapach from the callapee (or the back from the belly part) down to the shoulders, so as to come at the entrails, which take out, and clean as you would those of any other animal, and throw them into a tub of clean water, taking great care not to break the gall, but to cut it from the liver and throw it away. Then separate each distinctly, and put the guts into another vessel, open them with a small penknife, from end to end, wash them clean, and draw them through a woolen cloth in warm water, to clear away the slime, and then put them into clean cold water till they are used, with the other part of the entrails, which must all be cut up small, to be mixed in the baking dishes with the meat. This done separate the back and the belly pieces entirely, cutting away the four fins by the upper joint, which scald, peel off the loose skin, and cut them into small pieces, laying them by themselves, either in another vessel, or on the table, ready to be seasoned. Then cut off the meat from the belly part, and clean the back from the lungs, kidneys, &c. and that meat cut into pieces as small as a walnut, laying it likewise by itself. After this you are to scald the back and belly pieces, pulling off the shell from the back, and the yellow skin from the belly, when all will be white and clean; and with the kitchen cleaver cut those up likewise into pieces about the bigness or breadth of a card. Put these pieces into clean cold water, wash them out, and place them in a heap on the table, so that each part may lie by itself. The meat, being thus prepared and laid separate for seasoning, mix two-thirds parts of salt, or rather more, and one-third part of Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and a nutmeg and mace pounded fine, and mixed together; the quanity to be proportioned to the size of the turtle, so that in each dish there may be about three spoonfuls of seasoning to every twelve pounds of meat. Your meat being thus seasoned, get some sweet herbs, such as thyme, savory, &c. let them be dried and rubbed fine, and having provided some deep dishes to bake in, (which should be of the common brown ware) put in the coarsest part of the meat at the bottom, with about a quarter of a pound of butter in each dish, and then some of each of the several parcels of meat, so that the dishes may be all alike, and have equal proportions of the different parts of the turtle; and between each laying of the meat, strew a little of the mixture of sweet herbs. Fill your dishes within an inch and a half, or two inches of the top; boil the blood of the turtle, and put into it; then lay on force-meat balls made of veal, or fowl, highly seasoned with the same seasoning as the turtle; put in each dish a gill of good Madeira wine, and as much water as it will conveniently hold; then break over it five or six eggs, to keep the meat from scorching at the top, and over that shake a handful of shred parsley, to make it look green; when done put your dishes into an oven made hot to make bread, and in an hour and a half, or two hours, (according to the size of your dishes) it will be sufficiently done. To boil all kinds of GARDEN STUFF. In dressing all sorts of kitchen garden herbs, take care that they are clean washed; that there be no small snails, or caterpillars between the leaves; and that all the coarse outer leaves, and those that have received any injury by the weather, be taken off. Next wash them in a good deal of water, and put them into a cullender to drain. Care must likewise be taken, that your pot or sauce pan be clean, well tinned, and free from sand or grease. To boil Asparagus. First cut the white ends off about six inches from the head, and scrape them from the green part downwards very clean. As you scrape them throw them into a pan of clean water; and after a little soaking, tie them up in small even bundles. When your water boils, put them in, and boil them up quick; but by over boiling they will lose their heads. Cut a slice of bread for a toast, and bake it brown on both sides. When your grass is done take them up carefully; dip the toast in the asparagus-water, and lay it in the bottom of your dish; then lay the heads of the asparagus on it with the white ends outwards: pour a little melted butter over the heads, cut an orange into small quarters, and stick them between for garnish. To boil Artichokes. Wring off the stalks close to the artichokes: Throw them into water, and wash them clean: then put them into a pot or sauce-pan. They will take better than an hour after the water boils; but the best way is to take out a leaf, and if it draws easy, they are enough. Send them to table with butter in tea-cups between each artichoke. To boil Cauliflowers. A cauliflower is the most favorite plant in the kitchen garden amongst the generality of people. Take off all green part, and cut the flower close at the bottom from the stalk; and if it be large or dirty, cut it into four quarters, that it may lay better in the pan, and be thoroughly cleansed. Let it soak an hour, if possible, in clean water; and then put it into boiling milk and water, (if you have any milk, ) or water only, and skim the pan very well. When the flower or stalks left above it feel tender, it will be enough; but it must be taken up before it loses its crispness; for cauliflower is good for nothing that boils till it becomes quite soft. When enough, lay it to drain in a cullender for a minute or two, and serve it up in a dish by itself, and with melted butter in a bacon. To boil Brocoli. Strip off the small branches from the great one, then with a knife peel off the hard outside skin which is on the stalk and small branches, till you come to the top, and throw them into a pan of clean water as you do them. Have water boiling in a stew-pan, with some salt in it; when it boils, put in your brocoli, and as soon as the stalks are tender they are enough. Take them up with a skimmer, and be careful you do not break the heads off. Some eat brocoli like asparagus, with a toast baked, and laid in the dish, with the brocoli upon it, and sent to table with a little melted butter poured over it. To boil French Beans. Take your beans and string them; cut them in two, and then across; when you have done them all, sprinkle them over with salt, and stir them together. As soon as your water boils, put them in, salt and all; make them boil up quick. They will be soon done, and look of a better green than when growing in the garden. If they are very young, only take off the ends, break them in two, and dress them in the same manner. To boil Broad Beans. Beans require a good deal of water, and it is best not to shell them till just before they are ready to go into the pot. When the water boils, put them in with some pick'd parsley, and some salt; make them boil up quick and when you see them begin to fall they are enough. Strain them off. Garnish the dish with boiled parsley, and send plain butter in a cup, or boat. To boil Green Pease. When your pease are shelled, and the water boils, which should not be much more than will cover them, put them in with a few leaves of mint: As soon as they boil, throw in a piece of butter as big as a walnut, and stir them about; when they are enough, strain them off, and sprinkle on a little salt; shake them till the water drains off, send them hot to table, with melted butter in a cup. To boil Cabbage. If your Cabbage is large, cut it into quarters; if small, cut it in half; let your water boil, then put in a little salt, and next your cabbage, with a little more salt upon it; make your water boil as soon as possible, and when the stalk is tender, take up your cabbage into a cullender, or sieve, that the water may drain off, and send it to table as hot as you can. Savoys are dressed in the same manner. To boil Sprouts. Pick and wash your sprouts very clean, and see there are not snails or grubs between the leaves, cut them across the stem, but not the heart; after they are well washed, take them out of the water to drain; when your water boils, put in some salt, and then the sprouts, with a little more salt on them; make them boil quick, and if any scum arises, take it clean off. As soon as the stalks are tender strain them off, or they will not only lose their colour, but likewise their flavour. To boil Spinach. There is no herb requires more care in the washing, than spinach; you must carefully pick it leaf by leaf, take off all the stalks, and wash it in three or four waters; then put it into a cullender to drain. It does not require much water to dress it: half a pint in a sauce-pan that holds two quarts, will dress as much spinach, as is generally wanted for a small family. When your water boils, put in your spinach, with a spoon as you put it into the sauce-pan; let it boil quick, and as soon as tender, put it into a sieve or cullender, and press out all the water. When you send it to table, raise it up with a fork, that it may lie hollow in the dish. To boil Turnips. A great deal depends upon preparing this root for boiling. They require paring till all the stringy coat be quite cut off: for that outside will never boil tender. Being well rinded, cut them in two, and boil them in the pot with either beef, mutton, or lamb. When they become tender, take them out, press the liquor from them between two trenches, put them into a pan, and mash them with butter and a little salt, and send them to table in a plate or bason by themselves; or send them as they come out of the pot, in a plate, with some melted butter in a bason, for every one to butter and season them as they like. To boil Parsnips. Parsnips are a very sweet root, and an agreeable sauce for salt fish. They should be boiled in a great deal of water, and when you find they are soft, (which is known by running a fork into them) take them up and carefully scrape all the dirt off them, and then with a knife scrape them all fine, throwing away all the dirty parts; then put them in a sauce-pan with some milk, and stir them over the fire till they are thick. Take care they do not burn; add a good piece of butter, and a little salt, and when the butter is melted, send them to table. But parsnips are in common served up in a dish, when well boiled and scraped, with melted butter in a bason. To boil Carrots. Let them be scraped very clean, and when they are enough, rub them in a clean cloth, then slice some of them into a plate, and pour some melted butter over them; and garnish the dish with the others, either whole or cut in pieces, or split down the middle. If they are young spring carrots, half an hour will boil them; if large, an hour; but old Sandwich carrots will take two hours. To boil Potatoes. Potatoes must always be peeled, except they be very small and new. Some pare potatoes before they are put into the pot; others think it the best way, both for saving time and preventing waste, to peel off the skin as soon as they are boiled, which then slips off by rubbing them with a coarse cloth. In boiling them take care they be enough, and not over done; for if boiled too much, they mash and become watery. Therefore it requires good attention when you are boiling potatoes, and that they be taken up as soon as they begin to show the least disposition to break. This is a root in great request, and served up in a dish or plate, whole for the most part, with a bason of melted butter. On which occasion it will be some addition to the potatoes to set them before the fire till they are quite dry, and a little browned. CHAP. IV. OF FRYING. OF BUTCHER'S MEAT. To fry Tripe. CUT your tripe into pieces about three inches long, dip them into the yolk of an egg, and a few crumbs of bread, fry them of a fine brown, and then take them out of the pan, and lay them in a dish to drain. Have ready a warm dish to put them in, and send them to table, with butter and mustard in a cup. To fry Beef-Steaks. Take rump steaks, beat them very well with a roller, fry them in half a pint of ale that is not bitter, and whilst they are frying, for your sauce, cut a large onion small, a very little thyme, some parsley shred small, some grated nutmeg, and a little pepper and salt; roll all together in a piece of butter, and then in a little flour, put this into the stew-pan, and shake all together. When the steaks are tender, and the sauce of a fine thickness, dish them up. Another way to fry Beef-Steaks. Cut the lean by itself, and beat it well with the back of a knife, fry the steaks in just as much butter as will moisten the pan, pour out the gravy as it runs out of the meat, turn them often, and do them over a gentle fire; then fry the fat by itself, and lay upon the lean:--- For Sauce, put to the gravy a glass of red wine, half an anchovy, a little nutmeg, a little beaten pepper, and a shallot cut small; give it two or three little boils, season it with salt to your palate, pour it over the steak, and send them to table. To fry a loin of Lamb. Cut the loin into thin steaks, put a very little pepper and salt, and a little nutmeg on them, and fry them in fresh butter; when enough, take out the steaks, lay them in a dish before the fire to keep hot; then for sauce, pour out the butter, shake a little flour over the bottom of the pan, pour in a quarter of a pint of boiling water, and put in a piece of butter; shake all together, give it a boil or two up, pour it over the steaks, and send them to table. Note. You may do mutton the same way, and add two spoonfuls of walnut pickle. To fry Sausages with Apples. Take half a pound of sausages and six apples; slice four about as thick as a crown, cut the other two in quarters, fry them with the sausages of a fine light brown, and lay the sausages in the middle of the dish, and the apples round. Garnish with the quartered apples. Stewed cabbage and sausages fried, is a good dish; then heat cold peas pudding in the pan; when it is quite hot, heap it in the middle of the dish, and lay the sausages all round edgways, and one in the middle at length. To fry cold Veal. Cut it into pieces about as thick as a dollar, and as long as you please, dip them in the yolk of an egg, and then in crumbs of bread, with a few sweet herbs, and shred lemon-peel in it; grate a little nutmeg over them, and fry them in fresh butter. The butter must be hot, and just enough to fry them in: For Sauce, make a little gravy of the bone of the veal; when the meat is fried, take it out with a fork, and lay it in a dish before the fire, then shake a little flour into the pan, and stir it round; put in a little gravy, squeeze in a little lemon, and pour it over the veal. Garnish with lemon. To fry Beef Collops. Cut your beef in thin slices, about two inches long, lay them upon your dresser, and hack them with the back of a knife; grate a little nutmeg over them, and dust on some flour; lay them into a stew-pan, and put in as much water as you think sufficient for sauce; shred half an onion, and a little lemon-peel very fine, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a little pepper and salt: Roll a piece of butter in flour, and set them over a clear fire till they begin to simmer; shake them together often, but don't let them boil up; after they begin to simmer, ten minutes will do them; take out your herbs, and dish them up. Garnish the dish with pickles and horse-radish. To make Scotch Collops. Dip the slices of lean veal in the yolks of eggs, that have been beaten up with melted butter, a little salt, some grated nutmeg, and grated lemon-peel. Fry them quick; shake them all the time, to keep the butter from oiling. Then put to them some beef gravy, and some mushrooms, or forced-meat balls. Garnish with sausages and sliced lemon, and slices of broiled or fried bacon. Observe, If you would have the collops white, do not dip them in eggs. And when fried tender, but not brown, pour off the liquor quite clean; put in some cream to the meat, and give it just a boil up. To fry Veal Cutlets. Cut a neck of veal into steaks, and fry them in butter; and having made a strong broth of the scrag-end, boiled with two anchovies, some nutmeg, some lemon-peel, and parsley shred very small, and browned with a little burnt butter, put the cutlets and a glass of white wine into this liquor. Toss them up together: thicken with a bit of butter rolled in flour, and dish all together; squeeze a Seville Orange over, and strew as much salt on as shall give a relish. To fry Mutton Cutlets. Take a handful of grated bread, a little thyme and parsley, and lemon-peel shred very small, with some nutmeg, pepper, and salt; then take a loin of mutton, cut it into steak, and let them be well beaten; then take the yolks of two eggs, and rub the steaks all over. Strew on the grated bread with these ingredients mixed together. For the Sauce, take gravy, with a spoonful or two of claret, and a little anchovy. To fry Calf's Liver and Bacon. Cut the liver in slices, and fry it first brown and nice, and then the bacon; lay the liver in the dish, and the bacon upon it. Serve it up with gravy and butter, and a little orange or lemon juice, and garnish with sliced lemon. To fry sweetbreads and Kidneys. After splitting the kidneys, fry them and the sweetbreads in butter. Serve them up with a brown ragoo sauce, and mushrooms; garnish with fried parsley and sliced lemon. To fry Eggs as round as balls. Having a deep frying-pan, and three pints of clarified butter, heat it as hot as for fritters, and stir it with a stick, till it runs round like a whirlpool; then break an egg into the middle, and turn it round with your stick, till it be as hard as a poached egg; the whirling round of the butter will make it as round as a ball; then take it up with a slice, and put it into a dish before the fire; they will keep hot half an hour, and yet be soft; so you may do as many as you please. You may poach them in boiling water in the same manner. OF FISH. To fry Carp. Scale and clean your carp very well, slit them in two, sprinkle them with salt, flour them and fry them in clarified butter. Make a ragoo with a good fifth broth, the melts of your fifth, artichoke bottoms cut in small dice, and half a pint of shrimps; thicken it with the yolks of eggs, or a piece of butter rolled in flour: put the ragoo into a dish, and lay your fried carp upon it. Garnish with fried sippets crisp parsley, and lemon. To fry Tench. Slime your tenches, slip the skin along the backs, and with the point of your knife raise it up from the bone; then cut the skin across at the head and tail, strip it off, and take out the bone; then take another tench, or a carp and mince the fish small with mushrooms, chives and parsley. Season them with salt, pepper, beaten mace, nutmeg, and a few savoury herbs minced small. Mingle these all well together, then pound them in a mortar with crumbs of bread, as much as two eggs soaked in cream, the yolks of three or four eggs, and a piece of butter. When these have been well pounded, stuff the tenches with this force; take clarified butter, put it into a pan set it over the fire, and when it is hot, flour your tenches, and put them into the pan, one by one, and fry them brown; then take them up, lay them in a coarse cloth before the fire, to keep hot. In the mean time, pour all the grease and fat out of the pan, put in a quarter of a pound of butter, shake some flour all over the pan, and keep stirring with a spoon till the butter is a little brown; then pour in half a pint of white wine, stir it together, pour in half a pint of boiling water, an onion stuck with cloves, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a blade or two of mace. Cover them close, and let them stew as softly as you can for a quarter of an hour, then strain off the liquor, put it into the pan again, add two spoonfuls of catchup, have ready an ounce of truffles or morels boiled tender in half a pint of water, pour the truffles, water and all, into the pan, with a few mushrooms, and either half a pint of oisters , clean washed in their own liquor, and the liquor and all put into the pan, or some craw-fish; but then you must put in the tails, and after clean picking them, boil them in half a pint of water; then strain the liquor, and put into the sauce: or take some fish-melts, and toss up in your sauce. All this is just as you fancy. When you find your sauce is very good, put your tench into the pan, and make them quite hot, then lay them into your dish, and pour the sauce over them. Garnish with lemon. Or you may, for change, put in half a pint of stale beer instead of water. Or you may dress tench just as you do carp. To fry Trout. Scale your trout clean, then gut them, and take out the gills, wash them, and dry them in a cloth, flour them, and fry them in butter till they are of a fine brown; when they are enough, take them up, and serve them; fry some parsley green and crisp, melt anchovy and butter, with a spoonful of white wine. Dish your fish, and garnish with fried parsley and sliced lemon. You may pour your sauce over the fish, or send it in a boat, which you please. In this manner you may fry perch, small pike, jacks, roach, gudgeons, or a chine of fresh salmon. To fry Flat Fish. Dry the fish well in a cloth, rub them over with the yolk of an egg, and dust over some flour: let your oil, butter, lard, or dripping be ready to boil before you put in the fish; fry them off with a quick fire, and let them be of a fine brown. Before you dish them up, lay them upon a drainer before the fire sloping, for two or three minutes, which will prevent their eating greasy.--For sauce, take the Fish Sauce, No. 35. You must observe on fast days, and in Lent never to dress your fish in anything but butter or oil. To fry Herrings. After having cleaned your herring, take out the roes, dry them and the herrings in a cloth; flour them, and fry them in butter of a fine brown; lay them before the fire to drain; slice three or four onions, flour them and fry them nicely; dish up the herrings, and garnish them with the roes and onions; send them up as hot as you can, with butter and mustard in a cup. To fry Eels. After having cleaned and skinned your eels, split them, and cut them in pieces; let them lay for two or three hours in a pickle made in vinegar, salt, pepper, bay leaves, sliced onion, and juice of lemon; then dredge them well with flour, and fry them in clarified butter; serve them dry with fried parsley and lemon for garnish. Send plain butter, and anchovy sauce in several cups.--See sauce, No. 34, or 35. To fry Lampries. Bleed them and save the blood, then wash them in hot water to take off the slime, cut them in pieces, and let them be fried in butter, not quite enough, drain out all the fat, then put in a little white wine, and shake your pan; season them with whole pepper, nutmeg, salt, sweet herbs, and a bay leaf, a good piece of butter rolled in flour, and the blood that was saved; cover them close, and shake the pan often. When you think they are enough, take them up, and give the sauce a quick boil, squeeze in a little lemon, and pour the sauce over the fish.--Send it to table garnished with lemon. To fry small Fish of all Sorts. Small fish are generally dressed to garnish a dish of fish, as smelts, gudgeons, roach, small whitings, &c. Wipe them dry with a cloth, then rub them over with the yolk of an egg, flour them, and dip them in oil, butter, hog's lard, or beef-dripping; take care they are fried of a fine light brown; and if they are sent by themselves in a dish, garnish with fried parsley and lemon. Whitings when small should be turned round, the tail put into the mouths and so fried; if large, they are skinned, turned round and fried. Plaice, flounders, and dabs are rubbed over with eggs, and fried. As these sorts of fish are generally dressed by themselves for supper, you may send various sauces as you like best; either shrimps, oysters, anchovy and butter, or plain melted butter; and some chuse oil and lemon. --See Sauces, No. 32, 33, 34, or 35. To fry Oysters. You must make a batter of milk, eggs, and flour; then take your oisters and wash them; wipe them dry, and dip them in the batter, then roll them in some crumbs of bread and a little mace beat fine, and fry them in very hot butter or lard. Or, beat four eggs with salt, put in a little nutmeg grated, and a spoonful of grated bread, then make it as thick as batter for pancakes, with fine flour; drop the oysters in, and fry them brown in clarified beef suet. They are to lie round any dish of fish. Ox-palates boiled tender, blanched, and cut in pieces, then fried in such batter, is proper to garnish hashes or fricassees. OF GARDEN STUFF. To fry Artichoke Bottoms. First blanch them in water, then flour them, fry them in fresh butter, lay them in your dish, and pour melted butter over them. Or you may put a little red wine into the butter, and season with nutmeg, pepper, and salt. To fry Cauliflowers. Take two fine cauliflowers, boil them in milk and water, then leave one whole, and pull the other to pieces; take half a pound of butter, with two spoonfuls of water, a little dust of flour, and melt the butter in a stewpan; then put in the whole cauliflower cut in two, and the other pulled to pieces, and fry it till it is of a very light brown. Season it with pepper and salt. When it is enough, lay the two halves in the middle, and pour the rest allover. To fry Celery. Take six or eight heads of celery, cut off the green tops, and take off the outside stalks, wash them clean; then have ready half a pint of white wine, the yolks of three eggs beat fine, and a little salt and nutmeg; mix all well together with flour into a batter, dip every head into the batter, and fry them in butter. When enough, lay them in the dish, and put melted butter over them. To fry Potatoes. Cut them into thin slices, as big as a crown piece, fry them brown, lay them in the plate or dish, pour melted butter, sack, and sugar over them. These are a pretty corner plate. To fry Onions. Take some large onions, peel them, and cut them into slices about a quarter of an inch thick; then dip these slices into batter, or an egg beaten, without breaking them, and fry them of a nice brown. To fry Parsley. Pick the parsley very clean, and see that it be young. Then put a little butter into a clean pan, and when it is very hot put in the parsley; keep it stirring with a knife till it be crisp, then take it out, and use it as garnish for fried lamb, &c. CHAP. V. OF BROILING. To Broil Beef Steaks, Mutton, or Pork Chops. LAY your steaks on the gridiron, and throw upon them pepper and salt to your taste. Do not turn them till one side be enough; and when the other side has been turned a little while, a fine gravy will lie on the top, which you must take care to preserve and lift it altogether with a pair of small tongs, or carefully with a knife and fork, into a hot dish and put a little piece of butter under it, which will help to draw out the gravy. Some palates like it with a shallot or two, or an onion shred very fine. But if they be mutton or pork steaks, they must be frequently turned on the gridiron. The general sauce for steaks is, horse-radish for beef; mustard for pork, and gherkins pickled for mutton. But in the season, I would recommend for a good sallad, or green cucumbers, or celery for beef and mutton; and green peas for lamb steaks. To broil Pigeons. Put a bit of butter, some shred parsley, and a little pepper and salt in the bellies of the pigeons, and tie them up neck and vent. Set yor gridiron high, that they may not burn; and send them up with a little melted butter in a cup. You may split them, and broil them with a little pepper and salt; or you may roast them, and serve them up with a little parsley and butter in a boat. To broil Chickens. Slit them down the back, and season them with pepper and salt, lay them at a great distance, on a very clear fire. Let the inside lie downward, till they are above half done; then turn them, and take great care the fleshy side do not burn; throw over them some fine raspings of bread, and let them be of a fine brown, but not burn. Let your sauce be good gravy with mushrooms, and garnish with lemon and the livers broiled, the gizzards cut, slashed, and broiled, with pepper and salt. --See sauce, No. 16. To broil Cod, Salmon, Whitings, or Haddock. Flour them and have a quick, clear fire; set your gridiron high, broil them of a fine brown, and lay them in a dish. For sauce, take a good melted butter, with the body of a lobster bruised therein; cut the meat small, put all together into the melted butter, make it hot, and pour it into the dish, or into basons. Garnish with horse-radish and lemon. To broil Mackrel. Gut them, wash them clean, pull out the roe at the neck end, boil it in a little water, then bruise it with a spoon; beat up the yolk of an egg, with a little nutmeg, lemon-peel cut fine, shred thyme, some parsley boiled and chopped fine, a little pepper and salt, and a few crumbs of bread; mix all well together and fill the mackrel; flour them well and broil them nicely. Let your sauce be plain butter, with a little catchup or walnut pickle. To broil Herrings. Scale them, gut them, cut off their heads, wash them clean, dry them in a cloth, flour them and broil them, but with a knife just notch them across: Take the heads and mash them, boil them in small beer or ale, with a little whole pepper and an onion. Let it boil a quarter of an hour, then strain it; thicken it with butter and flour, adding a good deal of mustard. Lay the fish in a dish, and pour the sauce into a bason; or serve them up with plain butter and mustard. To broil Cod's Sounds. You must first lay them in hot water a few minutes; take them out, and rub them well with salt, to take off the skin and black dirt, and to make them look white; then put them in water and give them a boil. Take them out and flour them well, pepper and salt them and broil them. When they are enough, lay them in the dish, and pour melted butter and mustard into the dish. Broil them whole. To broil Eels. Take a large eel, skin it and make it clean. Open the belly, cut it in four pieces; take the tail end, strip off the flesh, beat it in a mortar, season it with a little beaten mace, a little grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, a little parsley and thyme, a little lemon-peel, and an equal quantity of crumbs of bread; roll it in a little piece of butter, then mix it again with the yolk of an egg; roll it up again and fill the three pieces of belly with it. Cut the skin of the eel, wrap the pieces in, and sew up the skin. Broil them well, and have butter and an anchovy for sauce, with a piece of lemon. To spitchcock Eels. You must split a large eel down the back and joint the bones, cut it in two or three pieces, melt a little butter, put in a little vinegar and salt, let your eels lay in it two or three mintues; then take the pieces up one by one, turn them round with a little fine skewer, roll them in crumbs of bread, and broil them of a fine brown. Let your sauce be plain butter, with the juice of lemon, or good gravy with an anchovy in it. To broil Eggs. First put your salamander into the fire, then cut a slice round a quartern loaf, toast it brown, and butter it, lay it in the dish, and set it before the fire; poach seven eggs just enough to set the whites, take them out carefully, and lay them on your toast: brown them with the salamander, grate some nutmeg over them, and squeeze Seville orange over all. Garnish your dish with orange cut in slices. CHAP. VI. OF STEWING. To stew Beef. TAKE four pounds of stewing beef, with the hard fat of brisket beef cut in pieces; put these into a stew-pan with three pints of water, a little salt, pepper, dried marjorum powdered, and three cloves. Cover the pan very close, and let it stew four hours over a slow fire. Then throw into it as much turnips and carrots cut into square pieces, as you think convenient; and the white part of a large leek, two heads of celery shred fine, a crust of bread burnt, and half a pint of red wine (or good small beer will do as well.) Then pour it all into a soup-dish, and serve it up hot, garnish with boiled carrot sliced. To stew Brisket of Beef. Having rubbed the brisket with common salt and saltpetre, let it lie four days. Then lard the skin with fat bacon, and put it into a stew pan with a quart of water; a pint of red wine, or strong beer, half a pound of butter, a bunch of sweet herbs, three or four shallots, some pepper and half a nutmeg grated. Cover the pan very close. Stew it over a gentle fire for six hours. Then fry some square pieces of boiled turnips very brown. Strain the liquor the beef was stewed in, thicken it with burnt butter, and having mixed the turnips with it, pour all together over the beef in a large dish. Serve it up hot, and garnish with lemon sliced. An ox cheek or a leg of beef, may be served up in the same manner. To Stew Beef Gobbets. Cut any piece of beef, except the leg, in pieces, the size of a pullet's egg. Put them into a stew pan, and cover them with water. Let them stew one hour and skim them very clean. Then add a sufficient quantity of mace, cloves, and whole pepper, tied up loose in a muslin rag, some celery cut small, and salt, turnips, and carrots, pared and cut in slices, a little parsley, a bundle of sweet herbs, a large crust of bread, and if you please, add an ounce of pearl barley, or rice.

Then cut them into pieces and dish them with cox-combs and artichoke bottoms cut small; and garnish with lemon sliced, and with sweetbreads stewed for white dishes, and fried for brown ones, and cut also into little pieces. N. B. This stew is generally used for improving a fricasee, or a ragoo of veal, lamb, rabbits, &c. To stew Beef Steaks. Half broil the beef steaks, then put them into a stew-pan, season them with pepper and salt according to your palate; just cover them with gravy. Also put in a piece of butter rolled in flour. Let them stew gently for half an hour, then add the yolks of two eggs beat up, and stir altogether for two or three minutes, and serve it up. Garnish with pickles and horse-radish scraped. To stew Beef Collops. Cut raw beef, as veal is cut for Scotch collops. Put the collops into a stew-pan with a little water, a glass of white wine, a shallot, a little dried marjoram, rubbed to powder, some salt and pepper, and a slice or two of fat bacon. Set this over a quick fire, till the pan be full of gravy; which will be in a little time; add to it a little mushroom juice, and then serve it up hot; and garnish with sliced lemon, or small pickles and red cabbage. To stew Veal in general. Let the veal be under-roasted, or boiled; cut it into thick slices, and just cover the veal with water in a stew-pan. Season with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, a little mace, sweet marjoram, a shallot, and lemon-thyme, or a little grated lemon-peel. Stew all together, and when almost enough, put into the liquor a little good gravy, and mushroom liquor, a glass of white wine and a little lemon juice. Let these stew a little longer. Then strain off the liquor, and thicken it with butter and flour. Lay the meat in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. Garnish the dish with sippets, and fried oysters , or bits of broiled bacon and sliced lemon on the rim of the dish. To stew a Knuckle of Veal. Boil the knuckle till there is just enough liquor for sauce. To which add one spoonful of catchup, one of red wine, and one of walnut pickle; also some truffles, morels, or dried mushrooms cut small, if you please. Boil all together. When enough, take up the meat; lay it in a dish, pour the sauce or liquor over it, and send it to table, garnished with sliced lemon. To stew a Neck of Veal. Cut the neck of veal in steaks, and season them well with a mixture of salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, thyme, and knotted marjorum. Stew these gently over a slow fire, in cream or new milk, till they be enough, then add two anchovies, some gravy or strong broth, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Toss it up till it becomes thick. Then put it in a dish, and serve it up hot. Garnish with lemon sliced. To stew a breast of Veal. Let the breast be fat and white, cut off both ends and boil them for gravy. Make a forced-meat of the sweet-bread boiled, a few crumbs of bread, a little beef suet, two eggs, pepper and salt, a spoonful or two of cream, and a little grated nutmeg; with which mixure, having raised the thin part of the breast, stuff the veal; skewer the skin close dawn, dredge it over with flour; tie it up in a cloth, and stew it in milk and water about an hour. The proper Sauce for this dish is made of a little gravy, about a gill of oysters, a few mushrooms shred fine, and a little juice of lemon, thickened with flour and butter. To stew a Pig. Roast a pig till it is thorough hot, then skin it, cut it in pieces, and put it into a stew-pan, with a sufficient quantity of strong gravy, a gill of white wine, some pepper, salt and nutmeg, an onion, a little marjoram, three spoonfuls of elder vinegar, (if you have any) and a piece of butter; cover all close, and stew it gently over a slow fire.

Truss and season the pigeons with pepper and salt; and having stuffed them with a mixture of their own livers shred with beef suet, bread crumbs, parsley, marjoram, and two eggs, sew them up at both ends, and put them into the jug, the breast downwards, with half a pound of butter. Stop up the jug, so that no steam can get out; then set them in a pot of water to stew. They will take two hours and more in doing, and they must boil all the time. When stewed enough, take them out of the gravy, skim off the fat clean; put a spoonful of cream, a little lemon-peel, an anchovy shred, a few mushrooms, add a little white wine to the gravy, and having thickened it with butter and flour, and dished up the pigeons, pour the sauce over them.

To stew Carp or Tench. Scrape them very clean, then gut them; wash them and the roes in a pint of good stale beer, to preserve all the blood, and boil the carp with a little salt in the water. In the mean time strain the beer, and put it into a sauce-pan with a pint of red wine, two or three blades of mace, some whole pepper black and white, an onion stuck with cloves, half a nutmeg bruised, a bundle of sweet herbs, a piece of lemon-peel as big as a six-pence, an anchovy, and a little piece of horse-radish. Let these these boil together softly for a quarter of an hour, covered close; then strain the liquor, and add to it half the hard roe beat to pieces, two or three spoonfuls of catchup, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and a spoonful of mushroom pickle; let it boil, and keep stirring it till the sauce is thick and enough; if it wants any salt, you must put some in, then take the rest of the roe, and beat it up with the yolk of an egg, some nutmeg, and a little lemon-peel cut small; fry it in fresh butter in little cakes, and some pieces of bread cut three corner-ways and fried brown. When the carp are enough take them up, pour your sauce over them, lay the cakes round the dish, with horse-radish scraped fine, and fried parsley.

When it is enough, take out the sweet herbs and onion, and dish it up; pour the sauce over it. Garnish with lemon. To stew Eels. Stew, gut, and wash them very clean in six or eight waters, to wash away all the sand; then cut them in pieces about as long as your finger; put just water enough in the pan for sauce, with an onion stuck with cloves, a little bundle of sweet herbs, a blade of mace, and some whole pepper in a thick muslin rag, cover the pan, and let them stew very softly. Look at them now and then; put in a little red wine, the juice of half a lemon, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. When you find they are quite tender and well done, take out the onion, spice, and sweet herbs. Put in salt enough to season them, and dish them up with the sauce. To stew Oysters or Muscles. Plump them in their own liquor; then having drained off the liquor, wash them clear in fair water. Set the liquor drained from the oysters, or as much as is necessary (with the addition of an equal quantity of water and white wine, a little whole pepper, and a blade of mace, ) over the fire, and boil it well. Then put in the oysters, and let them just boil up, and thicken with a piece of butter and flour: some will add the yolk of an egg. Serve them up with sippets and the liquor, and garnish the dish with grated bread or sliced lemon. To stew Spinach and Eggs. Pick and wash your spinach very clean, put it into a sauce pan without water, throw in a little salt, cover it close, and shake the pan often; when it is just tender, and whilst it is green, put it into a sieve to drain, and lay it in your dish.

When the water boils, put in the eggs; have an egg-slice ready to take them out with, lay them on the spinach, and garnish the dish with orange cut in quarters, and send up melted butter in a cup. To stew Parsnips. Scrape them clean from the dirt, boil them tender, cut them into slices, put them into a sauce-pan, with cream enough for sauce, a piece of butter rolled in flour, a little salt, and shake the sauce-pan often. When the cream boils, pour them into a plate for a corner-dish, or a side dish at supper. To stew Cucumbers. Pare twelve cucumbers, and slice them as thick as a crown-piece, put them to drain, and then lay them in a coarse cloth till they are dry; flour them, and fry them brown in butter; cut out the fat, then put to them some gravy, a little port wine, some pepper, cloves, and mace; let them stew a little; then roll a bit of butter in flour, and toss them up; season with salt: You may add a little mushroom liquor. To stew Peas and Lettice. Take a quart of green pease, two nice lettices clean washed and picked, cut them small across, put all into a sauce-pan, with a quarter of a pound of butter, and pepper and salt to your palate; cover them close and let them stew gently, shaking the pan often. Let them stew ten minutes, then shake in a little flour; toss them round, and pour in half a pint of good gravy; put in a little bundle of sweet herbs, and an onion, with three cloves, and a blade of mace stuck in it. Cover the pan close, and let them stew a quarter of an hour longer; then take out the onion and sweet herbs, and pour the rest into the dish. To stew Red Cabbage. Take a red cabbage, lay it in cold water for an hour, cut into thin slices across, and then into little pieces. Put it into a stew-pan, with a pound of sausages, a pint of gravy, a little bit of ham or lean bacon; cover it close, and let it stew half an hour; then take the pan off the fire, and skim away the fat, shake in a little flour, and set it on again. Let it stew two or three minutes, then lay the sausages in the dish, and pour the rest all over. You may, before you take it up, put in half a spoonful of vinegar. To stew Pears. Pare six pears and either quarter them, or do them whole; (they make a pretty dish with one whole, the rest cut in quarter, and the cores taken out.) Lay them in a deep earthen pot, with a few cloves, a piece of lemon-peel, a gill of red wine, and a quarter of a pound of fine sugar. If the pears are very large, they will take half a pound of sugar, and half a pint of red wine; cover them close with paper, and bake them till they are enough. Serve them up hot or cold, just as you like them; and they will be very good with water in the place of wine. To stew Mushrooms. Take fresh mushrooms, clean them well, let their skins be pulled off, and their gills scraped out, if they happen to be sound, or else do not use them; cut the mushrooms in large pieces, and put them all together in a sauce-pan, without any liquor; cover it close, and let them stew gently, with a little salt, till they are tender, and covered with liquor; then take out your mushrooms, and drain them, or else put some pepper to them, with some white wine, and when they have boiled up, pour off the sauce, and thicken it with a little butter rolled in flour; some will put in a shallot with the spice, but that will spoil the flavour of the mushrooms, which everybody desires to preserve. CHAP. VII. OF HASHES. To Hash Beef. TAKE the raw part of any piece of roasted beef, and cut it into thin slices about the length of a little finger, and about the same breadth. Take also a little water, and an equal quantity of gravy; boil it well with a large onion cut in two, pepper and salt, then take a piece of butter rolled in flour, and stir it in the pan till it burns. Put it into the sauce, and let it boil a minute or two. Then put in the sliced beef, but you must only just let it warm through. Some add a few whole capers, mushrooms, walnut-pickle, or catchup. --Serve this up to table in a soup-dish, garnished with pickles. To hash mutton. Take mutton half roasted, and cut it in pieces as big as half a crown; then put into the sauce-pan half a pint of red wine, as much strong broth or gravy, (or water, if you have not the other) one anchovy, a shallot, a little whole pepper, some nutmeg grated, and salt to your taste; let these stew a little, then put in the meat, and a few capers and samphire shred; when it is hot through, thicken it up with a piece of fresh butter rolled in flour; have toasted sippets ready to lay in the dish, and pour the meat on them. Garnish with lemon. To dress a Lamb's Head and Pluck. Boil the head and pluck a quarter of an hour at most, the heart five minutes, the liver and lights half an hour. Cut the heart, liver, and lights into small square bits, not bigger than a pea. Make a gravy of the liquor that runs from the head with a quarter of a pint of the liquor in which it was boiled, a little walnut liquor or catchup, and a little vinegar, pepper, and salt. Then put in the brains and the hashed meat, shake them well together in the liquor, which should be only just as much as to wet the meat. Pour all upon the sippets in a soup dish; and, having grilled the head before the fire, or with a salamander, lay it open with the brown side upwards upon the hashed liver, &c. Garnish with sliced pickled cucumber, and thin slices of bacon broiled. To mince Veal. Take any part of the veal that is under done, either roasted or boiled, and shred it as fine as possible with a knife. Then take a sufficient quantity of beef gravy, dissolve in it the quantity of a hazul nut of cavear to half a pound of meat, and then put into the gravy the minced veal, and let it boil not above a minute. Pour it into a soup-plate or dish upon sippets of bread toasted; and garnish the dish with pickled cucumbers, &c. or with thin slices of bacon broiled. To hash a Calf's Head brown. Take a calf's head and boil it; when it is cold, take one half of the head, and cut off the meat in thin slices, put it into a stew-pan, with a little brown gravy, adding a spoonful or two of walnut pickle, a spoonful of catchup, a little red wine, a little shred mace, a few capers shred, or a little mango, boil it over a stove, and thicken it with butter and flour. Take the other part of the head, cut off the bone ends, and score it with a knife, season it with a little pepper and salt, rub it over with the yolk of an egg, and strew over a few bread crumbs, and a little parsley; then set it before the fire to broil till it is brown; and when you dish up the other part, put this in the middle; lay about your hash brain cakes, with forced meat balls, and crisp bacon. To make the Brain Cakes. Take a handful of bread crumbs, a little shred lemon-peel, pepper, salt, nutmeg, sweet marjoram, parsley shred fine, and the yolks of three eggs; take the brains and skin them, boil and chop them small, so mix them all together; put a little butter in your pan when you fry them, and drop them in as you do fritters. If they should run in your pan, put in a handful more of bread crumbs. To hash a Calf's Head White. Take a calf's head, and boil it as much as you would do for eating; when it is cold cut it in thin slices, and put it into a stew-pan, with a white gravy; then put to it a little salt, shred mace, a pint of oysters, a few shred mushrooms, lemon-peel, three spoonfuls of white wine, and some juice of lemon; shake all together, boil it over the stove and thicken it up with a little butter and flour. When you put it in the dish, you must lay a boiled fowl in the middle, and a few slices of crisp, bacon round the dish. To dress a Mock Turtle. Take a calf's head with the skin upon it, and scald off the hair as you would do off a pig; then clean it, cut off the horny part in thin slices, with as little of the lean as possible; put in the brains, and the giblets of a goose well boiled; have ready between a quart and three pints of strong mutton or veal gravy, with a pint of Madeira wine, a large tea-spoonful of Cayenne pepper, half the peel of a large lemon shred as fine as possible, a little salt, the juice of two lemons; stew all these together, till the meat is very tender, which will be in about an hour and a half; and then have ready the back shell of a turtle, edged with a paste of flour and water, which you must first set in the oven to harden; then put in the ingredients, and set it into the oven to brown the top; and when that is done, garnish the top with yolks of eggs boiled hard and forced-meat balls. N. B. If you cannot get the shell of a turtle, a China soup-dish will do as well; and the crust may be omitted. To hash cold Fowl. Cut your fowl up, divide the legs, wings, breast, &c. into two or three pieces each; then put them into a stew-pan, with a blade or two of mace, and a little shred lemon-peel; dredge on a little flour, and throw on some gravy; when it begins to simmer, put in a few pickled mushrooms, and a lump of butter rolled in flour. When it boils, give it a toss or two, and pour it into the dish. Garnish with sliced lemon and barberries. To hash a Hare.

To make Gravy Soup. TAKE the bones of a rump of beef, and a piece of the neck, and boil it till you have all the goodness of it; then strain it off, and take a good piece of butter, put it in a stew-pan, and brown it, then put to it an onion stuck with cloves, some celery, endive spinach, and three carrots; put to your gravy some pepper, salt, and clover, and let it boil all together; then put in sippets of bread dried by the fire; and you may add a glass of red wine. Serve it up with a French roll toasted, and laid in the middle. To make a rich Giblet Soup. Take four pounds of gravy beef, two pounds of scrag of mutton, two pounds of scrag of veal; stew them well down in a sufficient quantity of water for a strong broth; let it stand till it is quite cold, then scum the fat clean off. Take two pair of giblets well scalded and cleaned, put them into your broth, and let them simmer till they are stewed tender; then take out your giblets, and run the soup through a fine sieve to catch the small bones; then take an ounce of butter, and put it into a stew-pan, mixing a proper quantity of flour, to make it of a fine light brown. Take a small handful of chives, the same of parsley, and a very little of sweet marjoram; chop all these herbs together excessive small; set your soup over a slow fire, put in your giblets, butter and flour, and small herbs: then take a pint of Madeira wine, some Cayenne pepper and salt to your palate. Let them all simmer together, till the herbs are tender, and the soup is finished. Send it to table with the giblets in it. N. B. The livers must be stewed in a sauce-pan by themselves, and put in the dish when you serve it up. To make a good Pease Soup. Take a quart of split pease, put them into a gallon of soft water, with a bunch of herbs, some whole Jamaica and black pepper, two or three onions, a pound of lean beef, a pound of mutton, and a pound of the belly piece of salt pork; boil all together, till your meat is thoroughly tender, and your soup strong; then strain it through a sieve, and pour it into a clean sauce-pan; cut and wash three or four large heads of celery, some spinach, and a little dried mint, rubbed fine; boil it till your celery is tender, then serve it up with bread cut in dice, and fried brown. To make green Pease Soup. Have a knuckle of veal of four pounds, a pint and a half of the oldest green pease shelled, set them over the fire with five quarts of water; add two or three blades of mace, a quarter of an ounce of whole pepper, a small onion stuck with three cloves, and a bunch of sweet herbs; cover it close, and let it boil till half is wasted; strain it off, and pass your liquor through a sieve, put it into a clean sauce-pan, with a pint of the youngest pease, the heart of a cabbage, a lettuce or two, and the white part of three or four heads of celery, cut small, cover it close, and let it stew for an hour. If you think it is not thick enough, take some of your soup, and put in half, a spoonful of flour; stir it in a bason till it is smooth; pour it into your soup; stir it well together, and let it boil for ten minutes; then dish it up with the crust of a French roll. To make a White Portable Soup. Take a leg of veal, bone it, and take off all the skin and fat; take likewise two dozen of fowl or chickens feet, washed clean, and chopped to pieces; put all into a large stoving-pot, with three gallons of soft water, and let it stove gently, till the meat is so tender as to separate. You must keep your pot tight covered, and a constant fire during the time of its stoving; in about seven or eight hours, try your jelly in a cup, and when quite cold, if it so stiff as that you can cut it with a knife, take it off, and strain it through a sieve, and take off all the fat, and scum first with a spoon, and then with a filtering paper: Provide china cups, and fill them with the clear jelly; set them in a gravy pan, or a large stew-pan of boiling water over a stove; in this water boil your jelly in the cups, till it is as thick as glue. After which, let them stand in the water till they are quite cold: Before you turn them out of your cups, run the edge of a knife round to loosen them; then turn them upon a piece of new flannel, which will draw out all the moisture gradually. Turn them every six or eight hours, till they are perfectly dry, and like a piece of glue; keep them in as dry a place as you can, and in a little time they will be so hard, that you may carry them in your pocket, without the least inconvenience. When you want to use it, take a piece about the bigness of a walnut, and pour a pint of boiling water on it, stirring it till it is dissolved; season it with salt to your taste, and you will have a bason of strong broth. If you want a dish of soup, boil vermicelli in water; then to a cake of your soup, pour a pint of water, so that four cakes will make two quarts; when it is thoroughly melted, set it over the fire just to simmer; pour it into the dish, put in thin slices of bread hardened before the fire, and the vermicelli upon them. Thus you have a dish of soup in about half an hour. Whilst this is doing, you may have any thing dressing to follow, which will not only be a good addition to your dinner, but saving time. Note. Season it to your palate, as there is no salt or seasoning in the preparation. To make a Brown Portable Soup. Take a large leg of beef, bone it, and take off the skin, and what fat you can; put it into a stoving pot, with a tight cover; put to it about four gallons of soft water, with six anchovies, half an ounce of mace, a few cloves, half an ounce of whole white pepper, three onions cut in two, a bunch of thyme, sweet marjoram and parsley, with the bottom crust of a two-penny loaf that is well baked; cover it very close, and let it have a constant fire to do leisurely for seven or eight hours; then stir it very well together, to make the meat separate; cover it close again, and in an hour try your broth in a cup, to see if it will glutinate; if it does, take it off, and strain it through a canvass jelly bag into a clean pan; then have China or well glazed earthen cups, and fill them with the clear jelly; put them into a broad gravy pan, or stew-pan, with boiling water; set in the cups, and let them boil in that till they are perfectly glue. When they are almost cold, run a knife round them, and turn them upon a piece of new flannel, to draw out all the moisture; in six or seven hours turn them, and do so till they are perfectly hard and dry; put them into stone jars, and keep them in a dry place. This is very good for soups, sauces, and gravies. When you intend to make it into soup, shred and wash very clean what herbs you have to enrich it, as celery, endive, chervil, leeks, lettuce, or indeed what herbs you can get; boil them in water till they are tender, strain them off, and with that water dissolve what quantity of portable soup you please, according to the strength you would have it. If you are where you can get it, fry a French roll, and put it in the middle of your dish, moistened first with some of your soup; and when your cakes are thoroughly melted, put your herbs to it, and set it over the fire till it is just at boiling; then dish it up, and send it to table. To make Vermacelli Soup. Take two quarts of strong veal broth, put it into a clean sauce-pan, with a piece of bacon stuck with cloves, and half an ounce of butter rolled in flour; then take a small fowl trussed to boil, break the breast bone, and put it into your soup; stove it close, and let it stew three quarters of an hour: take about two ounces of vermacelli, and put to it some of the broth; set it over the fire till it is quite tender. When your soup is ready, take out your bacon, skim your soup as soon as possible, then pour it on the fowl, and lay your vermacelli all over it; cut some French bread thin, put into your soup, and send it to table. If you choose it, you may make your soup with a knuckle of veal, and send a handsome piece of it in the middle of the dish, instead of the fowl. To make Soup Lorrain. Have ready a strong veal broth that is white, and clean scummed from all fat; blanch a pound of almonds, beat them in a mortar, with a little water, to prevent their oiling, and the yolks of four poached eggs, the lean part of the legs, and all the white part of a roasted fowl; pound all together as fine as possible; then take three parts of the veal broth, put it into a clean stew-pan, put your ingredients in, and mix them well together; chip in the crust of two French rolls well rasped; boil all together over a stove, or a clear fire. Take a French roll, cut a piece out of the top, and take out all the crum; mince the white part of a roasted fowl very fine, season it with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little beaten mace; put in about an ounce of butter, and moisten it with two spoonfuls of your soup strained to it; set it over the stove to be thorough hot: Cut some French rolls in slices, and set them before the fire to crisp; then strain off your soup through a tammy or a lawn strainer, into another clean stew-pot; let it stew till it is as thick as cream; then have your dish ready; put in some of your crisp bread; fill your roll with the mince, and lay on the top as close as possible; put it in the middle of the dish, and pour a ladleful of your soup over it; put in your bread first, then pour in the soup, till the dish is full. Garnish with petty patties; or make a rim for your dish, and garnish with lemon raced. If you please, you may send a chicken boned in the middle, instead of the roll; or you may send it to table with only crisp bread. To make a sorrel Soup with Eggs. Take the chump end of a loin of mutton, and part of a knuckle of veal, to make your stock with; season it with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and a bunch of sweet herbs; boil it till it is as rich as you would have it; strain it off, and put it into a clean sauce pan: Put in a young fowl, cover it over, and stove it; then take three or four large handfuls of sorrel washed clean; chop it grosly, fry it in butter, put it to your soup, and let it boil till your fowl is thoroughly done; scum it clean, and send it to table with the fowl in the middle, and six poached eggs placed round about it. Garnish the dish with sippets, and stewed sorrel. To make Asparagus Soup. Take five or six pounds of lean beef cut in lumps, and rolled in flour; put it into your stew-pan, with two or three slices of fat bacon at the bottom; then put it over a slow fire, and cover it close, stirring it now and then till the gravy is drawn: then put it in two quarts of water and half a pint of ale. Cover it close, and let it stew gently for an hour, with some whole pepper, and salt to your mind; then strain off the liquor, and take off the fat; put in the leaves of white beets, some spinach, some cabbage, lettuce, a little mint, some sorrel, and a little sweet marjoram powdered; let these boil up in your liquor, then put in the green tops of asparagus cut small, and let them boil till all is tender. Serve it up hot, with a French roll in the middle. Rich Soups in Lent, or for Fast Days. To make a Craw Fish Soup. Cleanse them, and boil them in water, salt, and spice: pull off their feet and tails, and fry them; break the rest of them in a stone mortar, season them with savory spice, and an onion, a hard egg, grated bread, and sweet herbs boiled in good table beer; strain it, and put to it scalded chopped parsley, and French rolls; then put in the fried craw fish, with a few mushrooms. Garnish the dish with sliced lemon, and the feet and tail of a craw fish. To make Oyster Soup. Have ready a good fish stock, then take two quarts of oysters without the beards; bray the hard part in a mortar, with the yolks of ten hard eggs. Set what quantity of fish stock you shall want over the fire with your oysters; season it with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. When it boils, put in the eggs, and let it boil till it is as thick as cream. Dish it up with bread cut in dice. To make an Eel Soup. Take eels according to the quantity of soup you would make; a pound of eels will make a pint of soup; so to every pound of eels put a quart of water, a crust of bread, two or three blades of mace, a little whole pepper, an onion, and a bundle of sweet herbs; cover them close, and let them boil till half the liquor is wasted; then strain it, toast some bread, and cut it small, lay the bread in the dish, and pour in your soup. If you have a stew hole, set the dish over it for a minute, and send it to table. If you find your soup not rich enough, you must let it boil till it is as strong as you would have it, and add a piece of carrot to brown it. To make a brown Soup.

Make it boil, and thicken it with the yolks of two eggs; put it to the pie when both are very hot, and serve it up. A Turkey Pie. Bone the turkey, season it with savory spice and lay it in the pie, with two young fowls cut to pieces, to fill up the corners. A goose pie is made the same way, with two rabbits, to fill it up as aforesaid. A Pigeon Pie. Truss and season the pigeons with savory spices, and stuff them with forced-meat; lay on lamb-stones, sweetbreads; and butter; close the pie with a lear. A chicken or capon pie may be made the same way. A Battalia Pie. Take four small chickens, squab pigeons and four sucking rabbits, cut them in pieces, and season them with savory spice; lay them in the pie with four sweetbreads sliced, as many sheeps tongues and shivered palates, two pair of lamb-stones, twenty or thirty cocks-combs, with savory balls and oysters; lay on butter, and close the pie with a lear.

Mix these together, and fill the pies. A Carp Pie. To a quartern of flour put two pounds of butter, rubbing a third part in; make it into paste with water, then roll in the rest of the butter at three times; lay your paste in the dish, put in some bits of butter on the bottom paste, with pepper and salt, scale and gut your carps; put them in vinegar, water, and salt; then wash them out of the vinegar and water, wipe them dry, and make the following pudding for the belly of the carp: take the flesh of an eel, cut it small, add some grated bread, two buttered eggs, an anchovy cut small; a little nutmeg grated, with pepper and salt. Mix these together well, and fill the belly of the carp; then make some force-meat balls of the same mixture; cut off the tail and fins of the carp, and lay in the crust, with slices of fat bacon, a little mace, and some bits of butter; close your pie and before you set it in the oven, pour in half a pint of claret. Serve it up hot. Oyster Pie. Parboil a quart of large oysters in their own liquor, mince them small, and pound them in a mortar, with Pistachio-nuts, marrow and sweet herbs, an onion, savoury seeds, and a little grated bread; or season as aforesaid whole. Lay on butter, close it, and serve it up hot. Flounder Pie. Take twelve large flounders, cut off their tails, fins, and heads; then season them with pepper and salt, cloves, mace, and nutmeg beaten fine. Take two or three eels well cleaned, cut in-lengths of three inches, and season as before, then lay your flounders and eels in your pie, and the yolks of eight hard eggs, half a pint of pickled mushrooms, an anchovy, a little onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, and some lemon-peel grated. You must put three quarters of a pound of butter on the top, with a quarter of a pint of water, and a gill of white wine, then close your pie, and serve it hot, first taking out the onion and bunch of sweet herbs. Trout Pie. Clean, wash, and scale them, lard them with pieces of a silver eel rolled up in spice and sweet herbs, with bay leaves powdered; lay on and between them the bottoms of sliced artichokes, mushrooms, oysters, capers, and sliced lemon; lay on butter, and close the pie.

To make an Apple or a Pear Pie. Make a good puff paste crust, lay some round the sides of the dish, pare and quarter your apples, and take out the cores; lay a row of apples thick, throw in half the sugar you intend for your pie; mince a little lemon-peel fine, throw a few cloves, here and there one, then the rest of your apples, and the rest of your sugar. You must sweeten to your palate, and squeeze in a little lemon juice. Boil the peeling of the apples and the cores in fair water, with a blade of mace till it is very good; strain it, and boil the syrup with sugar till it is rich; pour it into your pie, put on your upper crust, and bake it. You may put in a little quince or marmalade, if you please. Thus make a pear pie, but don't put in any quince. You may butter them when they come out of the oven, or beat up the yolks of two eggs, and half a pint of cream, with a little nutmeg, sweetened with sugar; take off the lid, and pour in the cream. Cut the crust in little three cornered pieces, stick them about the pie, and send it to table. To make a Cherry, Plumb, or Gooseberry Pie. Make a good crust, lay a little round the sides of your dish, throw sugar at the bottom, and lay in your fruit, with sugar on the top. A few red currants will do well with them; put on your lid, and bake it in a slack oven. Make a plumb pie the same way, and also a gooseberry pie. If you would have it red, let it stand a good while in the oven after the bread is drawn. A custard is very good with the gooseberry pie. To make Tarts of divers Kinds. If you propose to make them in patty-pans, first butter them well, and then put a thin crust all over them, in order to your taking them out with the greater ease; but if you make use of either glass or china dishes, add no crust but the top one. Strew a proper quantity of fine sugar at the bottom; and after that lay in your fruit, of what sort soever, as you think most proper, and strew a like quantity of the same sugar over them. Then put your lid on, and let them be baked in a slack oven. If you make tarts of apples, pears, apricots, &c. the beaten crust is looked upon as the most proper; but that is submitted to your own particular fancy. To make Apple Tart, or Pear Tart. Pare them first, then cut them into quarters, and take the cores out; in the next place cut each quarter across again; throw them so prepared into a sauce-pan, with no more water in it than will just cover the fruit; let them simmer over a slow fire till they are perfectly tender. Before you set your fruit on the fire, take care to put a good large piece of lemon-peel into the water. Have the patty-pans in readiness, and strew fine sugar at the bottom; then lay in the fruit, and cover them with as much of the same sugar as you think convenient. Over each tart pour a tea-spoonful of lemon-juice, and three spoonfuls of the liquor in which they are boiled. Then lay the lid over them, and put them into a slack oven. If the tarts be made of apricots, &c. you must neither pare them, nor cut them, nor stone them, nor use lemon-juice, which is the only material difference between these and other fruit. Observe, with respect to preserved tarts, only lay in the preserved fruit and put a very thin crust over them, and bake them as short a time as possible. Orange or Lemon Tarts. Take six large lemons, rub them very well with salt, and put them into water with a handful of salt in it, for two days; then change them into fresh water every day (without salt) for a fortnight; after this boil them two or three hours till they are tender, cut them into half-quarters, and then again three-quarter ways, as thin as you can. Take six pippins pared, cored, and quartered, and a pint of fair water, in which let them boil till the pippins break; put the liquor to your orange or lemon, with half the pulp of the pippins well broken, and a pound of sugar. Boil these together a quarter of an hour, then put it in a gallipot, and squeeze on orange in it: if it be a lemon tart, squeeze a lemon; two spoonfuls is enough for a tart. Your patty-pans must be small and shallow. Use fine puff-paste and very thin. A little baking will do. Just as your tarts are going into the oven, with a feather or brush do them over with melted butter, and then sift double refined sugar over them: This is a pretty icing. Icing for Tarts. Beat and sift a quarter of a pound of fine loaf sugar. Put it into a mortar with the white of one egg that has been well beat up. Add to these two spoonfuls of rose water, and beat all together till it be so thick as just to run, observing to stir it all one way. It is laid on the tart with a brush or small bunch of feathers dipped in the icing. Set the tarts when so done, into a very gentle oven to harden. But take care not to let them stand too long, for that will discolour them. An Almond Tart very good. To half a pound of almonds blanched, and very finely beat with orange-flower water, put a pint of thick cream, two large Naples biscuits grated, and five yolks of eggs, with near half a pound of sugar; put all into a dish garnished with paste, and lay slips in diamonds cross the top; bake it in a cool oven; and when drawn out, stick slips of candied citron in each diamond. Orange Puff. Pare off the rinds from Seville oranges, then rub them with salt; let them lie twenty-four hours in water, then boil them in four changes of water, making the first salt; drain them dry, and beat them fine to a pulp; bruise in the pieces of all that you have pared, make it very sweet with fine sugar, and boil it till it is thick; let it stand till it is cold, and then it will be fit to put into the paste. Lemon Puffs. Take a pound and a quarter of double refined sugar beaten and sifted, and grate the rinds of two lemons, and mix well with the sugar, then beat the whites of two new-laid eggs very well, and mix them well with the sugar and lemon-peel; beat them together an hour and a quarter, then make them up in what form you please; be quick to set them in a moderate oven; do not take off the papers till cold. CHAP. XII. TO MAKE ALL SORTS OF CAKES. A rich Cake. TAKE six pounds of the best fresh butter, work it to a cream with your hands; then throw in by degrees three pounds of double refined sugar, well beat and sifted; mix them well together, then work in three pounds of blanched almonds; and having beated four pounds of eggs, and strained them through a sieve, put them in; beat them all together till they are thick and look white. Then add half a pint of French brandy, half a pint of sack, a small quantity of ginger, and about two ounces each of mace, cloves, and cinnamon, with three large nutmegs, all beaten in a mortar as fine as possible. Then shake in gradually four pounds of well dried and sifted flour. When the oven is well prepared, and a tin hoop to bake it in, stir into this mixture (as you put it into the hoop) seven pounds of currants well washed and rubbed, and such a quantity of candied orange, lemon, and citron, in equal proportions, as shall be thought convenient. The oven must be quick, and the cake will at least take four hours to bake it: Or, you may make two or more cakes out of these ingredients. You must beat it with your hands, and the currants must be plumped by pouring upon them boiling water, and drying them before the fire. Put them warm into the cake. Another rich Cake. To a quartern and a half of fine flour add six pounds of currants, an ounce of cloves and mace, a little cinnamon; two grated nutmegs, a pound of the best sugar, some candied lemon, orange, or citron, cut in thin pieces; a pint of sweet wine, a little orange flower or rose water, a pint of yeast, a quart of cream, two pounds of butter melted, and poured into the middle of the flour. Then strew some flour over the butter, and let it stand half an hour before the fire. After which knead it well together, and put it before the fire to make it rise. Work it up very well; put this mixture into a tin hoop, and bake it two hours and a half in a gentle oven. A Spanish Cake. Take twelve eggs, three quarters of a pound of the best moist sugar, mill them in a chocolate mill, till they are all of a lather; then mix in one pound of flour, half a pound of pounded almonds, two ounces of candied orange-peel, two ounces of citron, four large spoonfuls of orange or rose water, half an ounce of cinnamon, and a glass of sack. It is best when baked in a slow oven. Portugal Cakes. Put a pound of fine sugar, a pound of fresh butter, five eggs, and a little mace, beaten, into a broad pan; beat it with your hands till it is very light, and looks curdling; then put thereto a pound of flour, and half a pound of currants very dry; beat them together, fill tin pans, and bake them in a slack oven. You may make seed cakes the same way, only put in carraway-seeds instead of currants. Dutch Cakes. Take five pounds of flour, two ounces of carraway-seeds, half a pound of sugar, and something more than a pint of milk, put into it three quarters of a pound of butter, then make a hole in the middle of the flour, and put in a full pint of good ale-yeast: pour in the butter and milk, and make these into a paste, letting it stand a quarter of an hour before the fire to rise; then mould it, and roll it into cakes pretty thin; prick them all over pretty much, or they will blister, and bake them a quarter of an hour. Shrewsberry Cakes. Take one pound of sugar, three pounds of the finest flower, a nutmeg grated, and some cinnamon well beaten; the sugar and spice must be sifted into the flower, wet it with three eggs, and as much melted butter as will make it of a good thickness to roll into a paste; mould it well, and roll it; cut it into what shape you please; perfume the cakes, and prick them before they go into the oven. Marlborough Cakes. Take eight eggs, yolks and white, beat and strain them, and put them to a pound of sugar, beaten and sifted; beat these three quarters of an hour together, then put in three quarters of a pound of flour well dried, and two ounces of carraway seeds; beat all well together, and bake it in broad tin pans, in a brisk oven. Queen Cakes. Take a pound of sugar, beat it fine, pour in yolks and whites of two eggs, half a pound of butter, a little rose water, six spoonfuls of warm cream, a pound of currants, and as much flour as will make it up; stir them well together, and put them into your patty-pans, being well buttered; bake them in an oven, almost as hot as for bread, for half an hour; then take them out and glaze them, and let them stand but a little after the glazing is on to rise. Uxbridge Cakes. Take a pound of wheat flour, seven pounds of currants, half a nutmeg, and four pounds of butter; rub your butter cold very well among the meal. Dress the currants very well in the flour, butter, and seasoning, and knead it with so much good and new yeast as will make it into a pretty high paste: usually two-penny-worth of yeast to that quantity. After it is kneaded well together, let it stand an hour to rise. You may put half a pound of paste in a cake. A Pound Cake. Take a pound of butter, beat it in an earthen pan with your hand one way till it is like a fine thick cream; then have ready twelve eggs, with half the whites; beat them well first, and also beat them up with the butter, working into it a pound of flour, a pound of sugar, and a few carraways, for an hour with your hand, or a great wooden spoon. Butter a pan, put it in, and then bake it an hour in a quick oven. A Seed Cake. Take three pounds of fine flour, and rub in two pounds of butter; eight eggs, and four whites, a little cream, and five spoonfuls of yeast. Mix all together, and put it before the fire to rise; then add three quarters of a pound of carraway-seeds, and put it in a hoop or tin rim well buttered. An hour and a half will bake it. Fine Almond Cakes. Take a pound of Jordan Almonds, blanch them, beat them very fine with a little orange-flower water, to keep them from oiling; then take a pound and a quarter of fine sugar, boil it to a high candy, and put in your almonds. Then take two fresh lemons, grate off the rind very thin, and put as much juice as to make it of a quick taste, put this mixture into glasses, set it in a stove, stirring often, that it may not candy: so when it is a little dry, part it into small cakes upon sheets of paper, or tin, to harden. Saffron Cakes. Take half a peck of the finest flour, a pound of butter, and a pint of cream, or good milk; set the milk on the fire, put in the butter, and a good deal of sugar; then strain saffron to your taste and liking into the milk; take seven or eight eggs, with two yolks, and seven or eight spoonfuls of yeast; put the milk to it when it is almost cold, with salt, and coriander seeds; knead them all together, make them up in reasonable sized cakes, and bake them in a quick oven. Orange Cakes. Take the peels of four oranges, being first pared, and the meat taken out; boil them tender, and beat them small in a marble mortar; then take the pulp of them, and two more oranges, the seeds and shins being picked out, and mix them with the peelings that are beaten, set them on the fire, with a spoonful or two of orange-flower water, keeping it stirring till that moisture is pretty well dried up; then have ready to every pound of that pulp, four pounds and a quarter of double refined sugar, finely sifted. Make the sugar very hot, dry it upon the fire, and then mix it and the pulp together; set it on the fire again, till the sugar be well melted, but take care it does not boil. You may put in a little peel, shred small or grated; and when it is cold, draw it up in double papers; dry them before the fire, and when you turn them, put two together, or you may keep them in deep glasses or pots, and dry them as you have occasion. Common Biscuits. Beat up six eggs, with a spoonful of rose water, and a spoonful of sack; then add a pound of fine powdered sugar, and a pound of flour; mix these into the eggs by degrees, with an ounce of coriander seeds; shape them on white thin paper or tin moulds, in any form you please. Beat the white of an egg, and with a feather rub it over, and dust fine sugar over them. Set them in an oven moderately heated, till they rise and come to a good colour; and if you have no stove to dry them in, put them into the oven at night, and let them stand till morning. To make Whigs. Take three pounds and a half of flour, and three quarters of a pound of butter; rub it into the flour till none of it be seen; then take a pint or more of new milk, make it very warm, and with a half pint of ale-yeast, make it into a light paste, put in carraway-seeds, and what spice you please; then make it up, and lay it before the fire to rise; after this, work in three quarters of a pound of sugar, and then roll them pretty thin into what form you please; put them on tin plates and hold them before the fire to rise again, before you set them in; your oven must be pretty quick. To make Buns. Take two pounds of fine flour, a pint of ale-yeast, with a little sack, and three eggs beaten; knead all these together with a little warm milk, nutmeg, and salt. Lay it before the fire, till it rise very light. Then knead into it a pound of fresh butter, and a pound of round carraway comfits, and bake them in a quick oven, on floured papers, in what shape you please. Maccaroons. Take a pound of almonds, let them be scalded, blanched, and thrown into cold water, then dry them in a cloth, and pound them in a mortar; moisten them with orange-flower water, or the white of an egg, lest they turn to an oil; after this take an equal quantity of fine powdered sugar, with three or four whites of eggs; beat all well together, and shape them on water paper with a spoon.--Bake them on tin plates in a gentle oven. Good Fritters. Mix half a pint of good cream very thick with flour, beat six eggs, leaving out four whites; add six spoonfuls of sack, and strain them into the cream; put in a little grated nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, and salt; then put in another half pint of cream, and beat the batter near an hour; pare and slice your apples thin, dip every piece in the batter, and throw them into a pan with boiling lard. Pan Cakes. Take a pint of thick cream, six spoonfuls of sack, and half a pint of fine flour, six eggs, but only three whites, one grated nutmeg, a quarter of a pound of melted butter, a very little salt, and some sugar; fry these thin in a dry pan. Cheesecakes after the best manner. First warm a pint of cream, and then add to it five quarts of milk that is warm from the cow; and when you have put a sufficient quantity of rennet to it, stir it about till it comes to a curd; then put the curd into a cloth, or linen bag, and let the whey be well drained from it: but take care not squeeze it hard; when it is sufficiently dry, throw it into a mortar, and beat it till it is as fine as butter. To the curd thus prepared, add half a pound of sweet-almonds, blanched & the same quantity of macaroons; both beaten together as fine as powder. If you have none of the last near at hand, make use of Naples biscuits in their stead; then add to your ingredients the yolks of nine eggs that have been well beaten, a whole nutmeg, and half a pound of double refined sugar. When you have mingled all these well together, melt a pound and a quarter of the best fresh butter, and stir well into it. As to your puff-paste for your cheesecakes, it must be made in the manner following: Wet a pound of fine flour with cold water, and then roll it out; put in gradually at least two pounds of the best fresh butter and shake a small quantity of flour upon each coat as you roll it. Make it just as you use it. N. B. Some will add to these, both currants and perfumed plumbs. Cheesecakes without Rennet. Take a quart of thick cream, and set it over a clear fire, with some quartered nutmeg in it: just as it boils up, put in twelve eggs well beaten; stir it a little while on the fire, till it begins to curdle, then take it off, and gather the curd as for cheese; put it in a clean cloth, tie it together and hang it up, that the whey may run from it, when it is pretty dry, put it in a stone mortar, with a pound of butter, a quarter of a pint of thick cream, some sack, orange-flower water, and half a pint of fine sugar; then beat and grind all these together for an hour or more, till it is very fine; pass it through a hair sieve, and fill your patty-pans but half full; you may put currants in half the quantity, if you please; a little more than a quarter of an hour will bake them. Take the nutmeg out of the cream when it is boiled. Potatoe or Lemon Cheesecakes. Take six ounces of potatoes, four ounces of lemon-peel, four ounces of sugar, and four ounces of butter; boil the lemon-peel tender, pare and scrape the potatoes, boil them tender also, and bruise them; beat the lemon-peel with the sugar, then beat all together very well, and melt the butter in a little thick cream: mix all together very well, and let it lie till cold; put crust in your patty-pans, and fill them little more than half full. Bake them in a quick oven half an hour; sift some double refined sugar on them as they go into the oven; this quantity will make a dozen small patty-pans. CHAP. XIII. OF PUDDINGS, &c.

Mix all together, and put it into a dish rubbed with butter. Half an hour will bake it; when enough, dust on some sugar, and serve it up hot. A Rice Pudding. Beat half a pound of rice to powder. Set it with three pints of new milk upon the fire, let it boil well, and when it grows almost cold, put to it eight eggs well beaten, and half a pound of suet or butter, half a pound of sugar, and a sufficient quantity of cinnamon, nutmeg, and mace. Half an hour will bake it. You may add a few currants; candied lemon, citron peel, or other sweet-meats; and lay a puff-paste first all over the sides and rim of the dish. A Poor Man's Pudding. Take some stale bread; pour over it some hot water till it is well soaked; then press out the water, and wash the bread; add some powdered ginger, nutmeg grated, and a little salt; some rose water or sack, Lisbon sugar, and currants; mix them well together, and lay it in a pan well buttered on the sides; when it is well flatted with a spoon, lay some pieces of butter on the top; bake it in a gentle oven, and serve it hot. You may turn it out of the pan when it is cold, and it will eat like a fine cheesecake. An Orange Pudding. Take the yolks of sixteen eggs, beat them well with half a pound of melted butter, grate in the rind of two Seville oranges, beat in half a pound of fine sugar, two spoonfuls of orange-flower water, two of rose water, a gill of sack, half a pint of cream, two Naples biscuits, or the crumb of a half penny roll soaked in the cream, and mix all well together. Make a thin puff-paste, and lay it all over the dish, and round the rim; pour in the pudding and bake it. It will take about as long baking as a custard. A Carrot Pudding. You must take a raw carrot, scrape it very clean, and grate it; take half a pound of the grated carrot, and a pound of grated bread; beat up eight eggs, leave out half the whites, and mix the eggs with half a pint of cream; then stir in the bread and carrot, half a pound of fresh butter melted, half a pint of sack, three spoonfuls of orange flower water, and a nutmeg grated. Sweeten to your palate. Mix all well together; and if it is not thin enough stir in a little new milk or cream. Let it be of a moderate thickness: lay a puff-paste all over the dish, and pour in the ingredients. Bake it, which will take an hour. It may also be boiled. If so, serve it up with melted butter, white wine, and sugar. A Quince, Apricot, or white Pear Plumb Pudding. Scald your Quinces very tender, pare them thin, scrape off the pulp, mix it with sugar very sweet, put in a little ginger and cinnamon. To a pint of cream you must put three or four yolks of eggs, and stir it into your quinces till they are of a good thickness. It must be pretty thick. So you may do apricots, or white pear-plumbs, but never pare them. Butter your dish pour it in, and bake it. An Italian Pudding. Lay puff-paste at the bottom and round the edges of the dish. Upon which pour a mixture of a pint of cream; French rolls enough to thicken it, ten eggs beaten very fine, a nutmeg grated, twelve pippins sliced, some orange peel and sugar, and half a pint of red wine. Half an hour will bake it. An Apple Pudding. Scald three or four codlins, and bruise them through a sieve. Add a quarter of a pound of biscuit, a little nutmeg, a pint of cream, and ten eggs, but only half the whites. Sweeten to your taste, and bake it. A Norfolk Dumplin. Make a batter as for pancakes, with a pint of milk, two eggs, a little salt, and as much flour as is needful. Drop this batter in pieces, into a pan of boiling water. And if the water boils fast, they will be sufficiently done in three minutes. Throw them into a sieve or cullender to drain. Then lay them in a dish; Stir a slice of fresh butter into each, and heat them hot. A Hard Dumpling. Mix flour and water, and a little salt, like a paste. Roll it into balls, as big as a turkey's egg. Have a pan of boiling hot water ready. Throw the balls of paste into the water, having first rolled them in flour. They eat best boiled in a beef pot; and a few currants added make a pretty change. Eat them with butter, as above. Apple Dumplings. Pare and core as many codlings as you intend to make dumplings. Make a little cold butter paste. Roll it to the thickness of one's finger, and wrap it round every apple singly; and if they be boiled singly in pieces of cloth, so much the better. Put them into boiling water, and they will be done in half an hour. Serve them up with melted butter and white wine and garnish with grated sugar about the dish. CHAP. XIV. OF SYLLABUBS, CREAMS, AND FLUMMERY. To make a fine Syllabub from the Cow. SWEETEN a quart of cyder with double refined sugar, and grate a nutmeg into it; then milk the cow into your liquor. When you have thus added what quantity of milk you think proper, pour half a pint, or more (in proportion to the quantity of syllabub you make) of the sweetest cream you can get, all over it. A White Syllabub. Take two porringers of cream, and one of white wine, grate in the skin of a lemon, take the whites of three eggs, sweeten to your taste, then whip it with a whisk; take off the froth as it rises, pour it into your syllabub-glasses or pots, and they are fit for use. To make a fine Cream. Take a pint of cream, sweeten to your palate; grate in a little nutmeg, add a spoonful of orange-flower water, or rose water, and two spoonfuls of sack; beat up four eggs, and two whites, stir it all together one way over the fire, till it is thick; have cups ready and pour it in. Lemon Cream. Take the juice of four large lemons, half a pint of water, a pound of double refined sugar beaten fine, the whites of seven eggs, and the yolk of one beaten very well; mix all together, strain it, set it on a gentle fire, stirring it all the while, and skim it clean; put into it the peel of one lemon when it is very hot, but not to boil; take out the lemon-peel, and pour it into china dishes. Rasberry Cream. Take a quart of thick sweet cream, and boil it two or three wallops; then put it off the fire, and strain the juice of rasberries into it to your taste; stir it a good while before you put your juice in, that it may be almost cold when you mix it, and afterwards stir it one way for almost a quarter of an hour; then sweeten it to your taste, and when cold you may send it up. Whipt Cream. Take a quart of thick cream, and the whites of eight eggs beaten with half a pint of sack; mix it together, and sweeten to your taste with double refined sugar; you may perfume it (if you please) with musk or ambergrease tied in a rag, and steeped a little in the cream. Whip it up with a whisk that has a bit of lemon-peel tied in the middle. Take off the froth with a spoon, and lay it in your glasses or basons. To make a Trifle. Cover the bottom of a dish or bowl with Naples biscuits broke in pieces, macaroons in halves and ratafia cakes. Just wet them through with sack; then make a good boiled custard not too thick, and when cold pour it over, then put a syllabub over that.--You may garnish with ratafia cakes, current jelly, and flowers. Flummery. Take a large calf's foot, cut out the great bones, and boil them in two quarts of water; then strain it off, and put to the clear jelly half a pint of thick cream, two ounces of sweet almonds, and an ounce of bitter almonds, well beaten together. Let it just boil, then strain it off, and when it is as cold as milk from the cow, put it into cups or glasses. Oatmeal Flummery. Put oatmeal (as much as you want) into a broad deep pan, cover it with water, stir it together, and let it stand twelve hours; then pour off that water clear, and put on a good deal of fresh, shift it again in twelve hours, and so on in twelve more. Then pour off that water clear, and strain the oatmeal through a coarse hair sieve, pour it into a sauce pan, keeping it stirring all the time with a stick, till it boils and becomes very thick. Then pour it into dishes. When cold, turn it into plates, and eat it with what you please, either wine and sugar, or milk. It eats very well with cyder and sugar. You may observe to put a great deal of water to the oatmeal, and when you pour off the last water, put on just enough fresh to strain the oatmeal well. Some let it stand forty-eight hours, some three days, shifting the water every twelve hours; but that is as you like it for sweetness or tartness. Groats, once cut, do better than oatmeal. Mind to stir it together when you put in fresh water. CHAP. XV. OF JELLIES, GIAMS, AND CUSTARDS. Calf's Feet Jelly. CUT four calves feet in pieces, put them into a pipkin, with a gallon of water, cover them close, and boil them softly till almost half be consumed, then run the liquor through a sieve, and let it stand till it be cold. With a knife take off the fat at top and bottom, melt the fine part of the jelly in a preserving pan or skillet, and put in a pint of Rhenish wine, the juice of four or five lemons, double refined sugar to your taste, the whites of eight eggs beaten to a froth; stir and boil all these together near half an hour; then pass it thro' a sieve into a jelley bag; put into your jelly bag a very small sprig of rosemary and a piece of lemon-peel; pass it through the bag till it is as clear as water. Hart's Horn Jelly. Take a large gallipot with hart's horn, then fill it full with spring water, tie a double paper over the gallipot, and set it in a baker's oven with household bread. In the morning take it out, run it through a jelly-bag, season with juice of lemons, double refined sugar, and the whites of eight eggs well beaten. Let it have a boil, and run it through the jelly-bag again into jelly-glasses, putting a bit of lemon-peel into the bag. Currant Jelly. Having stript the currants from the stalks, put them into a stone jar: stop it close; set it in a kettle of boiling water half way up the jar; let it boil half an hour; take it out, and strain the juice through a coarse hair sieve. To a pint of juice put a pound of sugar; set it over a fine quick clear fire in a preserving-pan or bell mettle skillet. Keep stirring it all the time till the sugar be melted; then skim the scum off as fast as it rises. When the jelly is very clear and fine, pour it into earthen or china cups, or gallipots. When cold, cut pieces of white paper just the bigness of the top of the pot, dip them in brandy, lay them on the jelly; then cover the top close with white paper, and prick it full of holes. Set it in a dry place. You may put some in glasses for present use. Rasberry Giam. Take a pint of currant jelly, and a quart of rasberries, bruise them well together, set them over a slow fire, keeping it stirring all the time till it boils. Let it boil five or six minutes, pour it into the gallipots, paper them as you do the currant jelly, and keep them for use. They will keep for two or three years, and have the full flavour of rasberries. A Custard. Sweeten a quart of new milk to your taste; grate in a little nutmeg, beat up eight eggs well (leaving out half the whites) stir them into the milk, and bake them in china cups, or put them into a deep china dish. Have a kettle of water boiling, set the cups in, let the water come about half way, but do not let it boil too fast, for fear of its getting into the cups. You may add a little rose-water, and French brandy. Boiled Custards. Put into a pint of cream two ounces of almonds, blanched and beaten very fine, with rose or orange-flower water, or a little thickened, then sweeten it, and stir in the eggs, and keep it stirring over the fire till it is as thick as you would have it; then put to it a little orange-flower water, stir it well together, and put it into china cups. N. B. You may make them without almonds. Almond Custards. Take a pint of cream, blanch and beat a quarter of a pound of almonds fine, with two spoonfuls of rose-water. Sweeten it to your palate. Beat up the yolks of four eggs, stir all together one way over the fire, till it is thick; then pour it out into your cups. Or you may bake it in little china cups. Rice Custards. Boil a quart of cream with a blade of mace, and a quartered nutmeg, put there to boiled rice well beat with the cream; mix these together, stirring them all the while they boil. When enough, take it off, and sweeten it to your taste; put in a little orange-flower water or brandy, then pour it into dishes. When cold, serve it up. CHAP. XVI. POTTING AND COLLARING. To pot Beef or Vension. WHEN you have boiled or baked, and cut your meat small, let it be well beaten in a marble mortar, with some butter melted for that purpose, and two or three anchovies, till you find it mellow and agreeable to your palate. Then put it close down in pots, and pour over them a sufficient quantity of clarified butter. You may season your ingredients with what spice you please. To pot Pigeons, or any other Fowls. Your pigeons being trussed and seasoned with savoury spice, put them in a pot, cover them with butter; and bake them; then take them out and drain them, and when they are cold, cover them with clarified butter. The same way you may pot fish, only bone them when they are baked. To pot Chars or Trouts. Clean the fish well, and bone them; wash them with vinegar, cut off the tails, fins and heads: then season them with pepper, salt nutmegs, and a few cloves; put them down close in a pot, and being well covered, bake them for a couple of hours or more, with a little verjuice and some butter; then pour off the liquor, and cover them with clarified butter. To pot Lampreys or Eels. Take lampreys or eels, skin, gut, and wash them, and slit them down the back; take out the bones, and cut them in pieces to fit your pot, then season them with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and put them in the pot, with half a pint of vinegar. They must be close covered, and baked half an hour; and when done, pour off the liquor, and cover them with clarified butter. To collar Beef. Lay a flank of beef in ham brine a fortnight, then take it out, and dry it in a cloth; lay it on a board, take out all the leather and skin, cut it cross and cross; season it with savoury spice, two anchovies, and a handful or two of thyme, parsley, sweet marjoram, winter-savoury, onions, and fennel, strew it on the meat, roll it into a hard collar in a cloth, sew it close, tie at both ends, and put it in a collar pot with a pint of red wine, cochineal, and two quarts of pump water. When it is cold, take it out of the cloth. To collar a Breast of Veal. Bone the veal, season it all over the inside with cloves, mace, and salt beat fine, a handful of sweet-herbs, stripped of the stalks, a little sage, penny-royal, and parsley shred very fine, then roll it up as you do brawn; bind it with narrow tape very close, then tie a cloth round it, and boil it very tender in vinegar and water, a like quantity, with a little mace, cloves, pepper, and salt, all whole. Make it boil, then put in the collars; when boiled tender, take it up; and when both are cold, take off the cloth, lay the collar in an earthen pan and pour the liquor over; cover it close, and keep it for use. To collar a Breast of Mutton. Cut off the red skin, and take out the bones and gristles. Then take grated white bread, a little cloves, mace, salt, and pepper, the yolks of three hard eggs bruised small, and a little lemon-peel shred fine: with which, having laid the meat even and flat, season it all over, and add three or four anchovies, washed and boned; then roll the meat like a collar, and bind it with coarse tape, and bake, boil, or roast it. To collar Pork. Bone a breast of pork, season it with savoury seasoning, a good quantity of thyme, parsley and sage; then roll it in a hard collar in a cloth, tie it at both ends, and boil it; and when it is cold, steep it in the savoury liquor in which it was boiled. To collar Eels. Scour large silver eels with salt, slit them down the back, and take out all the bones; then wash and dry them, and season them with savoury spice, minced parsley, thyme, sage, and onion; and roll each in little collars in a cloth, and tie them close. Then boil them in water and salt, with the heads and bones, half a pint of vinegar, a bunch of herbs, some ginger and a pennyworth of isinglass; when they are tender, take them up, tie them close again, strain the pickle, and keep the eels in it. CHAP. XVII. OF PRESERVING, DRYING, AND CANDYING. To keep Green Peas till Christmas. TAKE fine young peas, shell them, throw them into a cullender to drain, then lay a cloth four or five times double on a table, and spread them thereon; dry them very well, and have your bottles ready, fill them and cover them with mutton suet fat; when it is a little cool, fill the necks almost to the top, cork them, and tie a bladder and a leather over them, and set them in a cool dry place. To keep French Beans all the Year. Take young beans, gathered on a dry day, have a large stone jar ready, lay a layer of salt at the bottom, then a layer of beans, then salt and then beans, and so on till the jar is full; cover them with salt, and tie a coarse cloth over them, and a board on that, and then a weight to keep it close from all air; set them in a dry cellar, and when you use them, take some out and cover them close again; wash those you take out very clean, and let them lie in soft water twenty-four hours, shifting the water often; when you boil them do not put any salt in the water. To keep White Bullace, Pear Plumbs, or Damsons, &c. for Tarts or Pies. Gather them when full grown, and just as they begin to turn. Pick all the largest out; save about two thirds of the fruit; to the other third put as much water as you think will cover them, boil and skin them; when the fruit is boiled very soft, strain it through a coarse hair sieve, and to every quart of this liquor put a pound and a half of sugar, boil it and skim it very well; then throw in your fruit, just give them a scald, take them off the fire, and when cold put them into bottles with wide mouths, pour your syrup over, lay on a piece of white paper, and cover them with oil. To make Marmelade. To two pounds of quinces, add three quarters of a pound of sugar, and a pint of spring water; put them over the fire, and boil them till they are tender; drain off the liquor, and bruise them; then put them into it again, let it boil three quarters of an hour, and put it into your pots or saucers. To Preserve Mulberries whole. Set some mulberries over the fire in a skillet or preserving pan; draw from them a pint of juice when it is strained; then take three pounds of sugar beaten very fine, wet the sugar with the pint of juice, boil up your sugar and skim it, put in two pounds of ripe mulberries, and let them stand in the syrup till they are thoroughly warm; then set them on the fire, and let them boil very gently; do them but half enough, and put them by in the syrup till the next day, then boil them gently again when the syrup is pretty thick, and will stand in round drops when it is cold, they are enough; so put all into a gallipot for use. To preserve Gooseberries, Damsons, or Plumbs. Gather them when dry, full grown, and not ripe; pick them one by one, put them into glass bottles that are very clean and dry, and cork them close with new corks; then put a kettle of water on the fire, and put in the bottles with care; wet not the corks, but let the water come up to the necks; make a gentle fire till they are a little coddled, and turn white; do not take them up till cold, then pitch the corks all over, or wax them close, and set them in a cool dry cellar. To preserve Peaches. Put your peaches in boiling water, just give them a scald, but do not let them boil; take them out, and put them in cold water, then dry them in a sieve, and put them in long wide-mouthed bottles: to half a dozen of peaches take a quarter of a pound of sugar, clarify it, pour it over your peaches, and fill the bottles with brandy. Stop them close, and keep them in a dry place. To preserve Apricots. Pare your apricots, divide them in halves to take out the stones, and give them a light boiling in a pint of water, or according to your quantity of fruit; then add to the water after taking out the fruit, the weight of your apricots in sugar, and boil it till it comes to a syrup; put in the apricots again, and give them a light boiling, taking off the scum as it rises. When the syrup jellies, it is enough; then take up the apricots, and cover them with the jelly; put cut paper over them, and lay them down when cold. To preserve Apricots green. Take apricots when they are young and tender, coddle them a little, rub them with a coarse cloth to take off the skin, throw them into water as you do them, and put them in the same water they were coddled in; cover them with vine-leaves and white paper, or something more at the top; the closer you keep them, the sooner they are green; be sure you do not let them boil; when they are green, weigh them, and to every pound of apricots take a pound of loaf sugar, put it into the pan, and to every pound of sugar, a gill of water; boil your sugar and water a little, and skim it, then put in your apricots, let them boil together till your fruit looks clear, and your syrup thick; skim it all the time it is boiling, and put them into a pot covered with paper dipped in brandy. To preserve Plumbs. Take plumbs before they have stones in them, which you may know by putting a pin through; coddle them in many waters till they are as green as grass; peel them and coddle them again: you must take the weight of them in sugar, and make a syrup put to your sugar a pint of water; then put them in, set them on the fire to boil slowly, till they be clear, skimming them often, and they will be very green. Put them up in glasses, and keep them for use. To Preserve Cherries. Take two pounds of cherries, one pound and a half of sugar, half a pint of fair water, melt your sugar in it; when it is melted, put in your cherries; boil them softly at first, then faster, and skim them; take them off two or three times and shake them; put them on again, and let them boil fast. When they are of a good colour, and the syrup will stand, they are enough. To preserve Rasberries. Chuse rasberries that are not too ripe, and take the weight of them in sugar; wet your sugar with a little water, put in your rasberries, and let them boil softly; take heed of breaking them; when they are clear, take them up, and boil the syrup till it be thick, enough, then put them in again; and when they are cold, put them in glasses. To preserve Currants. Take the weight of the currants in sugar, pick out the seeds; to a pound of sugar add half a pint of water; let it melt; then put in your currants, and let them do very leisurely; skim them, and take them up; let the syrup boil, then put them on again; and when they are clear, and the syrup thick enough, take them off. When they are cold, put them in glasses. To dry Peaches. Take the fairest and ripest peaches, pare them into fair water; take their weight in double refined sugar: of one half make a very thin syrup; put in your peaches, boiling them till they look clear, then split and stone them. After this boil them till they are very tender, lay them a-draining, take the other half of the sugar, and boil it almost to candy; put in your peaches, and let them lie all night, then lay them on a glass, and set them in a stove, till they are dry. If they are sugared too much, wipe them with a wet cloth a little: let the first syrup be very thin; a quart of water to a pound of sugar. To dry Cherries. To four pound of cherries, put one pound of sugar, and just as much water to the sugar as will wet it; when it is melted, make it boil, stone your cherries, put them in, and give them a boil; skim them two or three times, take them off, and let them stand in the syrup two or three days; then boil your syrup again, and put it to them, but do not boil your cherries any more. Let them stand three or four days longer, then take them out, and lay them in a sieve to dry; when dry, lay them in rows on paper; a row of cherries, and a row of white paper, in boxes. To Candy Angelica. Gather it in April, boil it in water till it be tender, then take it up and drain it from the water very well; scrape the outside of it, dry it in a clean cloth, and lay it in the syrup; let it lie three or four days, and cover it close: the syrup must be rich, and keep it hot a good while, but let it not boil; lay it upon a pie plate, to let it dry; and keep it near the fire, lest it dissolve. CHAP. XVIII. OF PICKLING. To pickle Asparagus. GATHER your asparagus, and lay them in an earthen pot; make a brine of water and salt strong enough to bear an egg, pour it hot on them, and keep it close covered. When you use them, lay them in cold water two hours, then boil and butter them for table. If you use them as a pickle, boil them as they come out of the brine, and lay them in vinegar. To pickle Nasturtian Budds or Seeds. Take the seeds fresh of the plant when they are pretty large, but before they grow hard, and throw them into the best white wine vinegar that has been boiled up with what spices are most agreeable. Keep them close stopped in a bottle. They are fit for use in eight days. To pickle or make Mangoes of Melons. Take green melons, as many as you please, and make a brine strong enough to bear an egg; then pour it boiling hot on the melons, keeping them down quite under the brine; let them stand five or six days, then take them out, slit them down on one side, take out all the seeds, scrape or scope them a little in the inside, and wash them clean with cold water; then take a clove of garlic a little ginger and nutmeg sliced, and whole pepper; put all these proportionably into the melons, filling them up with mustard seed; then lay them in an earthen pot with the slit upwards, and take one part of mustard and two parts of vinegar, enough to cover them, pouring it upon them scalding hot, and keep them close stopped. To pickle Mushrooms. Cut the stems of small buttons at the bottom; wash them in two or three waters with a piece of flannel. Have in readiness a stew-pan on the fire, with some spring water that has had a handful of common salt thrown into it; and as soon as it boils, put in your buttons. When they have boiled about three or four minutes, take them off the fire, and throw them into a cullender; from thence spread them as quick as you can upon a linen cloth, and cover them with another. Have ready several wide-mouthed bottles; and as you put in the mushrooms, now and then mix a blade or two of mace, and some nutmeg sliced amongst them; then fill your bottles with distilled vinegar. If you pour over them some melted mutton-fat, that has been well strained, it will keep them better than oil itself would. To pickle Barberries. Take white wine vinegar and water, of each an equal quantity; to every quart of this liquor, put in half a pound of common sugar, then pick the worst of your barberries and put into this liquor, and the best into glasses; boil your pickle with the worst of your barberries, and skim it very clean. Boil it till it looks of a fine colour, and let it stand to be cold; then strain it through a cloth, wringing it to get all the colour you can from the barberries. Let it stand to settle, then pour it clear into the glasses. In some of the pickle boil a little fennell; when cold, put a bit at the top of the pot or glass, and cover it close with a bladder and leather. To pickle Radish pods. Make a pickle with cold spring-water and bay-salt, strong enough to bear an egg; put your pods in, and lay a thin board upon them to keep them under water. Let them stand ten days, then drain them in a sieve, and lay them on a cloth to dry. Take white wine vinegar, as much as you think will cover them, boil it, and put your pods in a jar, with ginger, mace, cloves, and Jamaica pepper. Pour on your vinegar boiling hot; cover them with a coarse cloth, three or four times double, that the steam may come through a little, and let them stand two days. Repeat this twice or thrice; when it is cold put in a pint of mustard seed, and some horse-radish; cover it close. To pickle Samphire. Lay what quantity you think proper of such samphire as is green in a clean pan, and (after you have thrown two or three handfuls of salt over it) cover it with spring water. When it has lain four and twenty hours, put it into a brass sauce-pan, that has been well cleaned; and when you have thrown into it one handful only of salt, cover it with the best vinegar. Cover your sauce-pan close, and set it over a gentle fire; let it stand no longer than till it is just crisp and green, for it would be utterly spoiled should it stand till it be soft. As soon as you have taken it off the fire, pour it into pickling pots, and take care to cover it close. To pickle Onions. Take small onions, peel them, lay them in salt and water a day, and shift them in that time once; then dry them in a cloth, and take some white wine vinegar, cloves, mace, and a little pepper; boil this pickle and pour over them, and when it is cold, cover it close. To pickle Cabbage. Take a large fine red cabbage, and cut it in thin slices, season some vinegar with what spice you think fit, then pour it on scalding hot, two or three times. To pickle French Beans. Gather them before they have strings, and put them in very strong brine of water and salt till they are yellow; then drain them from the brine, put boiling hot vinegar to them, and stop them close twenty-four hours; do so four or five days following, and they will turn green; then put to a peck of beans half an ounce of cloves and mace, and as much pepper. To pickle Cucumbers. Let your cucumbers be small, fresh gathered, and free from spots; make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg; boil this pickle, skim it well, then pour it upon your cucumbers, and stive them down for 24 hours; then strain them out into a cullender, dry them well with a cloth, and take the best white wine vinegar, with cloves, sliced mace, nutmeg, white pepper corns, long pepper, and races of ginger, (as much as you please) boil them up together, and then clap the cucumbers in, with a few vine-leaves, and a little salt. Let them simmer in this pickle till they are green, taking care not to let them boil: put them into jars, stive them down close, and when cold, tie on a bladder and leather. To pickle Walnuts. Put them into strong salt and water for nine days, and stir them twice a day, observing to change the salt and water every three days. Then let them stand in a hair sieve till they turn black. Put them into strong stone jars, and pour boiling allegar over them. Cover them up, and let them stand till they be cold. Then give the allegar three more boilings, pour it each time on the walnuts, and let it stand till it be cold between every boiling. Then tie them down with paper and a bladder over them, and let them stand two months. Then make for them the following pickle.--To every two quarts of allegar, put half an ounce of mace, and the same of olives; of black pepper, Jamaica pepper, ginger, and long pepper, an ounce each, and two ounces of common salt. Boil it ten minutes, pour it hot on your walnuts, and tie them down covered with paper and a bladder. CHAP. XIX. OF MADE WINES. To make Gooseberry Wine.

Buck-Wheat Cakes. Take milk-warm water, a little salt, a table spoonful of yeast, and then stir in your buck-wheat till it becomes of the thickness of batter; and then let it enjoy a moderate warmth for one night to raise it, bake the same on a griddle, greasing it first to prevent them from sticking. To make Pumpkin Pie. Take the Pumpkin and peel the rind off, then stew it till it is quite soft, and put thereto one pint of pumpkin, one pint of milk, one glass of malaga wine, one glass of rosewater, if you like it, seven eggs, half a pound of fresh butter, one small nutmeg, and sugar and salt to your taste. Dough Nuts. To one pound of flour, put one quarter of a pound of butter, one quarter of a pound of sugar, and two spoonfuls of yeast; mix them all together in warm milk or water, of the thickness of bread, let it raise, and make them in what form you please, boil your fat (consisting of hog's lard ), and put them in. To make Sausages. Take your pork, fat and lean together, and mince it fine, then season it with ground pepper, salt, and sage pounded, then have the offals well cleaned, and fill them with the above; they are then fit for use. When you put them in your pan remember to prick them to prevent them from bursting. To make Blood Puddings. Take your Indian meal (according to the quantity you wish to make), and scald it with boiled milk or water, then stir in your blood, straining it first, mince the hog's lard and put it in the pudding, then season it with treacle and pounded penny-royal to your taste, put it in a bag and let it boil six or seven hours. To make Cranberry Tarts. To one pound of flour three quarters of a pound of butter, then stew your Cranberry's to a jelly, putting good brown sugar in to sweeten them, strain the cranberry's, and then put them in your patty-pans for baking in a moderate oven for half an hour. To pickle Peppers. Take your peppers and cut a slit in the side of them, put them in cold salt and water for twelve hours, then take them out and put them in fresh salt and water, and hang them over the fire in a brass kettle, letting the water be as hot as you can bear your band in, let them remain over the fire till they turn yellow, when they turn yellow, shift the water, and put them in more salt and water of the same warmth; then cover them with cabbage leaves till they turn green, when they are done, drain the salt and water off, then boil your vinegar, and pour it over them: they will be fit for use in three days. To pickle Beets. Put into a gallon of cold vinegar as many beets as the vinegar will hold, and put thereto half an ounce of whole pepper, half an ounce of all spice, a little ginger, if you like it, and one head of garlic. Note. Boil the beets in clear water, with their dirt on as they are taken out of the earth, then take them out and peal them, and when the vinegar is cold put them in, and in two days they will be fit for use. The spice must be boiled in the vinegar. To make Peach Sweetmeats. To one pound of Peaches put half a pound of good brown sugar, with half a pint of water to dissolve it, first clarifying it with an egg; then boil the peaches and sugar together, skimming the egg off, which will rise on the top, till it is of the thickness of a jelly. If you wish to do them whole, do not peel them, but put them into boiling water, and give them a boil, then take them out and wipe them dry.-- Pears are done the same way. Quince Sweetmeats. To one pound of quinces put three quarters of a pound of good brown sugar: the quinces boiled. With respect to the rest follow the above receipt. Green Gage Sweetmeats. Make a syrup just as you do for quinces; only allowing one pound of sugar, to one pound of gages. -- Plumbs and damsons are made the same way. A Receipt to make Maple Sugar. Make an incision in a number of maple trees, at the same time, about the middle of February, and receive the juice of them in wooden or earthen vessels. Strain this juice (after it is drawn from the sediment) and boil it in a wide mouthed kettle. Place the kettle directly over the fire, in such a manner that the flame shall not play upon its sides. Skim the liquor when it is boiling. When it is reduced to a thick syrup and cooled, strain it again, and let it settle for two or three days, in which time it will be fit for granulating. This operation is performed by filling the kettle half full of syrup, and boiling it a second time. To prevent its boiling over, add to it a piece of fresh butter or fat of the size of a walnut. You may easily determine when it is sufficiently boiled to granulate, by cooling a little of it. It must then be put into bags or baskets, through which the water, will drain. This sugar, if refined by the usual process, may be made into as good single or double refined loaves, as were ever made from the sugar obtained from the juice of the West India cane. To make Maple Molasses. This may be done three ways. 1. From the thick syrup, obtained by boiling after it is strained for granulation. 2. From the drainings of the sugar after it is granulated. 3. From the last runnings of the tree [which will not granulate] reduced by evaporation to the consistence of molasses. To make Maple Beer. To every four gallons of water when boiling, add one quart of maple molasses. When the liquor is cooled to blood heat, put in as much yeast as is necessary to ferment it. Malt or bran may be added to this beer, when agreeable. If a table spoonful of the essence of spruce be added to the above quantities of water and molasses, it makes a most delicious and wholesome drink. Receipt to make the famous Thieves Vinegar. Take of wormwood, thyme, rosemary, lavender, sage, rue and mint, each a handful; pour on them a quart of the best wine vinegar, set them eight days in moderate hot ashes, shake them now and then thoroughly, then squeeze the juice out of the contents through a clean cloth; to which add two ounces of camphire. The use thereof is to rinse the mouth, and wash there with under the arm pits, neck and shoulders, temples, palms of the hands, and feet, morning and evening; and to smell frequently thereat, has its salutary effects. N. B. The above receipt did prove an efficacious remedy against the plague in London, when it raged there in the year 1665. Method of destroying the putrid Smell which Meat acquires during hot Weather. Put the meat intended for making soup, into a saucepan full of water, scum it when it boils, and then throw into the saucepan a burning pit coal, very compact and destitute of smoke, leave it there for two minutes, and it will have contracted all the smell of the meat and the soup. If you wish to roast a piece of meat on the spit, you must put it into water until it boils, and after having scummed it, throw a burning pit coal into the boiling water as before; at the end of two minutes, take out the meat, and having wiped it well in order to dry it, put it upon the spit. To make Spruce Beer out of the Essence. For a cask of eighteen gallons take seven ounces of the Essence of Spruce, and fourteen pounds of molasses; mix them with a few gallons of hot water; put it into the cask; then fill the cask with cold water, stir it well, make it about lukewarm; then add about two parts of a pint of good yeast or the grounds of porter; let it stand about four or five days to work, then bung it up tight, and let it stand two or three days, and it will be fit for immediate use after it has been bottled.

The following curious Method of rearing Turkeys to advantage, is translated from a Swedish Book, entitled Rural Œconomy. Many of our housewives, says this ingenious author, have long despaired of success in rearing turkey's, and complained, that the profit rarely indemnifies them for their trouble and loss of time: whereas, continues he, little more is to be done, than to plunge the chick into a vessel of cold water, the very hour, if possible, but at least the very day it is hatched, forcing it to swallow one whole pepper corn; after which let it be returned to its mother. From that time it will become hardy, and fear the cold no more than a hen's chick. But it must be remembered, that this useful species of fowls are also subject to one particular disorder when they are young, which often carries them off in a few days. When they begin to droop, examine carefully the feathers on the rump, and you will find two or three, whose quill-part is filled with blood, Upon drawing these the chikc recovers, and after that requires no other care, than what is commonly bestowed on poultry that range the court yard. The truth of these assertions is too well known to be denied; and as a convincing proof of the success, it will be sufficient to mention, that three parishes in Sweeden have, for many years used this method, and gained several hundred pounds by rearing and selling turkeys.
