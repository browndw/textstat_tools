THE SOUPS. An illustration of a woman dressed in Victorian garb preparing a meal in the kitchen. In this chapter we will describe the principal soups which can be made easily by any housewife. By modifying some of the recipes: for instance, by replacing in a puree one kind of vegetable for another, by game instead of fowl, or by varying the garnishing, she will have quite an infinite number of soups at her disposal. She should be careful, however, always to follow the general rules given and not to forget that anything printed in italics is always something essential. The soup beginning the dinner should be at the same time palatable and light, to prepare but not to overload the stomach. The soups are divided into two classes: the clear ones, whose nature is well indicated by the name, and the mixed or thick ones, that is to say, those into which, as into the puree and cream, enter eggs, flour or starch. Both of these two classes may contain either lean or fat soups. I. BOUILLON. STOCK SOUP. (Fat Soup--Clear.) Stock being the foundation of fat soups, and serving also to prepare numerous sauces and dishes, it would prove advantageous for a housekeeper to always have some stock at her disposal. This is quite easy, as stock may be kept fresh for several days in an ice box, preferably in an earthen jar, the only precaution necessary being to let it boil awhile, in case of a very hot or stormy day, to prevent its turning sour. To obtain a very good stock use at the same time beef, veal and fowl, the proportions being 6 parts of beef, 2 of veal, and 1 of fowl. As the beef gives the greatest part of the strength and nutriment, it may be used alone, but it will be at the expense of the aroma and delicacy of the stock. Moreover, the veal to be used being the shin bone, which is worth a mere nothing, and the fowl old hens, the expense will be scarcely increased. BEEF. --The parts of the beef to be employed for stock are: the neck, shoulder, shin, ribs, flank, round, legs; add also some marrow bones if you omit the veal. Don't forget that the meat must be very fresh, otherwise the bouillon will be inferior in every respect. VEAL. --The part to be employed is the shin bone or hock, which is very rich in gelatinous principles. FOWL. --Employ old fowls rather than young chickens, the former giving more taste, and having to be boiled quite a long time, it matters not if they are old and tough. VEGETABLES.--They should be very fresh and pared only when wanted for use. SALT. --Don't put in too much salt, because in some of its uses the bouillon may be associated with some preparations already salted and this will prove disagreeable. PROPORTIONS.--1. For a family of five and only for one meal: Beef and bones. ......5 lbs. Veal. ................1/2 hock (about 2 lbs.). Fowl. ................The body of 1 hen. Vegetables...........2 carrots, 1/2 turnip, 1 onion, some celery. Water. ...............From 3 to 4 quarts. Time. --About 5 hours. 2. To prepare 3 gallons of bouillon to be kept for culinary purposes: Beef. ...............15 lbs Veal. ...............1 hock (about 5 lbs.). Fowl * ...............1 hen, or the bodies of 2. Vegetables..........4 carrots, 1 turnip, 1 leek, some celery, 2 onions. Water. ..............3 1/2 gallons (about). Time. --About 5 hours. REMARKS.--One of the onions should be halved and browned on the stove before being put in the soup to give color and taste. When only one onion is used you brown one of the halves. You may also put one or two cloves in the part of the onion which has not been browned. The following note appears at the bottom of page 10 in the original text. *Boiled chicken served with a white sauce and rice is a very good family dish; the flesh of the chickens serve also for chicken croquettes. PREPARATION.--1st. Let the cold water from the faucet run freely over your beef and veal so as to wash them from all impurities. Put them in a kettle with the necessary quantity of water, * cold water and not hot or warm, taking care that the water covers the meat well but does not reach higher than two inches from the edge of the kettle. 2d. Allow to boil slowly while scumming until clear. It will prove advantageous to add from time to time one spoonful of cold water, which will facilitate and accelerate the separation of the scum. 3d. When the stock is clear (after half an hour) add your vegetables which should have been pared only a little while before, to be fresh, and let boil for two (2) hours. 4th. Take the veal out of the pot, as all juices will have been extracted from it. add the fowl and let the soup boil slowly for another three (3) hours. † 5th. Take the floating grease off, and pass through a strainer or napkin. CLARIFICATION. --If it happens that your stock is not clear, having perhaps boiled too quickly, you may clarify it as follows: 1st. Put your kettle on the corner of the range so that, though very hot, it doesn't boil. 2d. Break into a bowl or sauce pan 2 eggs with their shells, beat with 1/2 or 1 pound chopped meat, and 1 or 2 glassesful of water. Add while beating from 3 to 5 glasses of stock and pour the whole in the kettle while stirring. 4th. Pass the stock through a strainer and then through a napkin. 2. CONSOMME. (Fat Soup--Clear.) We call consomme a stock stronger and more palatable than the common one. It forms the fundament of the soups for fashionable dinners, or is served in cups at a ball supper or a select lunch. It is also very convenient for sick or feeble persons. PROPORTIONS.--For five persons: Fowl. .......1. Veal hock ...1/2. Vegetables..1 carrot, 1 onions, some celery. Stock. ......3 to 4 quarts. Time. --About 2 1/2 hours. PREPARATION.--1st. Cut to pieces the fowl and the veal, let them cook in some butter until a light brown; then put them in a kettle with the necessary amount of stock. 2d. Allow to cook slowly for two hours while scumming from time to time. 3d. Take the floating grease off and pass through a napkin. *Hot water would obstruct the pores of the meat thus enclosing juices as well as impurities. †Place your kettle on the corner of the range so that ebullition takes place only on one side of the kettle. In this way it is easier to obtain a clear soup. 3. CONSOMME DE VOLAILLE. CONSOMME OF FOWL. (Fat Soup--Clear.) Do as above (No. 2) but before serving take the fillets of the fowl off, cut them in dices and serve the consomme with those dices of flesh and 1 1/2 tablespoonsful of rice previously cooked apart in some salted water and carefully dripped. 4. POT AU FEU. (Fat Soup--Clear.) PROPORTIONS.--For five persons: Stock. ......2 to 8 quarts. Vegetables..2 carrots, 1 onion, 1/2 head of cabbage, 1 leek, some celery. Time. --1 3/4 to 2 hours.

Put the vegetables in an empty sauce pan or kettle, pour over the necessary quantity of stock and allow to cook slowly for 1 1/2 hours. 5. CROUTE AU POT. (Fat Soup--Clear.) The Croute au Pot is a Pot au Feu served with some pieces of toast in the soup. 6. PRINTANIER. (Fat Soup--Clear.) Two hours. NOTE. --The denomination "Printanier" comes from "Printemps," spring, and in this soup may enter all the vegetables produced by the spring, viz: young turnips, carrots, cauliflowers, Brussels sprouts, etc., points of asparagus and hops, green peas and beans, etc. The carrots and turnips must be as tender as possible, and you cut them in small dices or better in small balls or ovals with a vegetable spoon; the Brussels sprouts and the cauliflower shall not exceed the size of a hazel nut; the green peas shall be chosen as fine as possible and the green beans cut in small lozenges.

In every case you have first to cook well the particular materials until tender and to sift them through a sifter to obtain quite a clear pap; to which you add what the French cooks call a "liaison," binding, to unite all the parts together. This is made with yolks, cream and butter (also sometimes flour or starch), and don't forget 1st. That this "liaison" should be added only when ready to serve 2d. That the sauce pan shall be placed on a corner of the range and that you should add some of the hot pap to your "liaison" before you pour it in the sauce pan. 3d. That you should never allow a soup to boil after you have poured in a "liaison."

THE HORS D'OEUVRES The hors d'oeuvres are to be served more often at lunches than at dinners; however a quite fashionable dinner cannot be without some of them, at least without some cold ones. The "hors d'oeuvres" are divided into cold and warm, the former being more common because they are more easily prepared. THE COLD HORS D'OEUVRES. Usually the cold hors d'oeuvres are placed on the table in advance; by so doing you add to the general decorative effect and the guests will find at their disposal some light dishes, as soon as they have finished their soup and while awaiting the fish. They should always be served in special dishes ( radish dish, relish dishes, butter boat, etc.) in china or crystal. 46. RADISHES. They should be young and fresh. Cut the end of the root and leave only enough of the leaves to permit of taking them easily with the fingers. 47. OLIVES. Should be very green and served on a relish boat. 48. SARDINES. Should be taken from the box just before serving and disposed gently on a relish dish with some of their oil poured over. 49. ANCHOVIES. Serve as in the case of sardines. 50. SMOKED OR DRIED MEAT OR FISH. Should be sliced very fine and the slices disposed in a circle with some parsley in the middle. 51. CUCUMBER SALAD. Pare and slice the cucumbers, pour some salt over them, to facilitate the disengagement of the juice. After 10 min. drip those slices and mix with some pepper, oil and vinegar. 52. TOMATO SALAD. Prepare as the above, but don't peel them. An illustration of a fish split into halves and served on an oval platter. 53. HERRINGS. 1st. SMOKED.--Cut them in the middle, take the back bone and the skin off, cut the fillets in pieces 1 inch wide, dispose upon a plate and pour some olive oil over them. 2d. SALTED.--They should be freshened for 2 days in half milk and half water, then cut in the middle, take off the back bone, cut the fillets in pieces 1 inch wide and arrange them on a plate according to the accompanying cut. Pour over some oil mixed with vinegar, then chop apart the yolk and the white of a hard egg, also some parsley and red beets and dispose between the two halves. 54. OYSTERS. Should be opened before serving and presented on the hollow shell and not on the flat one, serve with lemons cut in two or four and not with vinegar. WARM HORS D'OEUVRES. The warm hors d'oeuvres belong more to the "Restaurant" than to the "Family" cooking. However the following are quite simple to prepare and will have a nice effect with a fashionable dinner. They should be served when the guests are finishing their soup and be cooked just before serving. Therefore it is difficult to serve them when you have more than 8 or 10 guests, and we recommend them more for select lunch and tea parties than for regular dinners. 55. CROQUETTES VOLAILLE. CROQUETTES OF FOWL. NOTE.--The flesh of fowls having served to make the stock (see foot note 1) is advantageously employed for croquettes. PROPORTIONS: Fowl. ..........The flesh of one.

There is certainly a greater number of fish in the United States than we have mentioned in this chapter, but having selected the most typical and common and having given for each the most appropriate mode of preparation and sauces, we think we have enabled the house-wife to prepare, by analogy, any fish she may wish to handle. Don't forget above all, that the first quality of a fish is its freshness, and to be fresh a fish should have these qualities: 1st. Its flesh thick and firm. 2d. Its eyes full and prominent. 3d. Its scales or gills bright. SALMON AND TROUT. 67. SAUMON OR TRUITE AU COURT BOUILLON. BOILED SALMON OR TROUT.

NOTE.--According to the number of the guests you serve a whole salmon or a part of it; a family dinner of 5 will require about 3 to 4 lbs. of fish, and we recommend to cook the same entire instead of slicing before cooking. TROUT.--The trout and especially the salmon trout having very great analogy to the salmon, what is said for the latter may be applied to the former. The fishes cooked "au court bouillon" being served with the sauce apart, we recommend cooking about twice as much fish as the dinner requires, because the remainder may be kept fresh for some days in au ice box and served cold as indicated in No. 81. PREPARATION.--We will tell here how to cook a whole salmon, from about 8 to 10 lbs. and it will be exactly the same with any other fish or part of fish to be cooked "au court bouillon." 1st. Clean and wash your fish, remove the gills and the fins, but preserve the tail, place the fish in a fish kettle (with a grate in the bottom so as not to break it, when you take it from the kettle) with 2 carrots, 1 onion sliced, some thyme and laurel, 6 grains of whole pepper and enough water to cover the fish well. 2d. Let heat and as soon as it boils place the fish pan on a corner of the stove and let simmer for about 1 hour without letting boil. 3d. Serve in a long dish on a folded napkin and dispose around the fish or serve apart 2 nice potatoes for each guest, boiled in slightly salted water and carefully carved. Serve the sauce apart.

Allow 2 eggs for each guest and 1 tablespoonful milk; this makes the omelet more tender and puffy, but many prefer it without milk. 184. OMELETTE AUX FINES HERBES. PLAIN OMELET WITH HASHED PARSLEY.

In a dinner the meats are certainly the most important parts; therefore it is natural that the cooks have done their utmost to present this most nourishing food under a good many forms. Usually the meats are divided into "Releves, Entrees and Roasts." The former are quite large pieces of meat roasted or baked, but always served entire with sauce and garnishes. They are presented after the fish and appear chiefly at a great dinner. The second are meats carved before being cooked, broiled, roasted, baked, boiled or stewed, but always served with a sauce and some vegetable as a garnish. They are essentially family dishes, but are also served at every dinner as fashionable, it may be (lean dinner excepted, of course), and are served after the releve, if any. The last are whole roasted pieces, served with a salad after the entree and side dishes (vegetables * ) and before sweet dishes. *In some dinners the side dishes are served after the roast, but we recommend the former manner, especially when a salad is served with the roast--what should be always the case, provided there is a guest at your table.
