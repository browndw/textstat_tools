DINNER SERVICE -AMERICAN STYLE -AND BILL OF FARE (Dinner Service à l'Américaine et le Menu). The success of a dinner depends upon good cooking, the manner in which it is served, and especially on entertaining congenial guests. The American service is copied more or less from the French and Russian, and remodeled to the tastes and customs of this country; as it varies somewhat from all others, a few instructions may be found useful to those desirous of learning the difference existing between them. THE BILL OF FARE (MENU). Menus are made for breakfasts, luncheons and suppers, but the most important one is for the dinner; these menus are generally composed a few days in advance to enable the necessary provisions to be purchased, so that on the day of the dinner, there has been ample time to prepare everything necessary, consequently much confusion is avoided and the work better done. In carrying out the order the menu should be strictly followed, in fact, it must be an obligatory rule to do so. Making out the bill of fare is the duty of the head cook, who composes and writes them according to the latitude he enjoys and the resources he has at hand. BILLS OF FARE FOR DINNER. Should the menu be intended for a dinner including ladies, it must be composed of light, fancy dishes with a pretty dessert; if, on the contrary, it is intended for gentlemen alone, then it must be shorter and more substantial. If the dinner be given in honor of any distinguished foreign guest, then a place must be allowed on the menu to include a dish or several dishes of his own nationality; avoid repeating the same names in the same menu. Let the gravies be of different colors, one following the other. Also vary the color of the meats as far as possible, from one course to the other. Offer on the menus all foods in their respective seasons, and let the early products be of the finest quality (consult a general market list to find the seasonable produce), and only use preserved articles when no others can be obtained. If the menus are hand written they must be very legible. Menus are indispensable for service à l'Américaine; there should be one for each guest, for as no dish served from the kitchen appears on the table, every one must be informed beforehand of what the dinner is composed, and those dishes that are to follow each other. Menus must be both simple and elegant, and of a size to allow them to be easily placed in the pocket without folding, as it is the general desire to keep the bill of fare of a dinner at which one has assisted. A few important observations necessary to bills of fare and their classification are here given: OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL. Oysters appear on the menu the same as in the Russian service on French bills of fare they do not mention them. Suppress oysters in every month not containing the letter R, such as: May, June, July and August, and serve Little Neck clams instead. SOUPS. Soups are served after the oysters. One clear and one thick soup should be selected but if only one is needed, give the preference to the clear soup. HORS-D'ŒUVRE, SIDE OR LIGHT DISHES. Hot hors-d'œuvre are, generally, timbales, croustades, cromesquis, palmettes, mousselines, bouchées, cannelons, cassolettes, rissoles, etc. With the same course serve cold side dishes, such as olives, radishes, canapés, caviare, pickled tunny, anchovies, etc. In the French service, the fish and the solid joints come under the head of relevés or removes. In the American and English service, first comes the fish, then the removes. FISH. If the fish be boiled or braized, add potatoes to the menu; if broiled or sautéd, some cucumber salad; and, if fried, serve plain or with a light sauce. REMOVES OR RELEVÉS. The relevés or solid joints are composed of saddles, either of veal, mutton, lamb, venison and antelope, or else beef tenderloins or middle short loins. Turkey, goose, capon, pullets, ducks, etc., may be served, accompanied by one or two vegetables. ENTRÉES. Place on the bill of fare first the heaviest entrée, and conclude with the lightest; they must be previously cut up so as to avoid carving. No fish figures in the American service as an entrée, but terrapin or crabs may be allowed; also lobsters, shrimps, frogs, croquettes, etc. Each entrée should be accompanied by a vegetable, served separately, except when it is one of those described above, such as terrapin, etc. PUNCH OR SHERBETS. A punch or sherbet is always served after the entrées and before the roast; do not make an extra heading on the menu for these, only placing them on a line by themselves, for instance: Roman punch or American sherbet. ROASTS. Roasts are served after the sherbet; a game roast is usually preferred, but poultry, either truffled or not, may be substituted: such as turkey, capon, pullet, duck, guinea-fowl, squabs, etc.; also roasted butcher's meat; but game is usually considered to be more choice. COLD DISHES. Cold dishes come after the roast, and before the hot dessert; they are served with green salads; terrines of foies-gras and boned turkey are also served as a second roast. (In the French service these cold dishes are classified as the last entrée.) HOT SWEET DISHES OR ENTREMETS. These appear after the roast; they are composed of puddings, crusts, fried creams, fritters, pancakes, borders, omelets, and soufflées, and form a separate course by themselves. COLD SWEET DISHES OR ENTREMETS. The cold sweet entremets come after the hot and are composed of jellies, bavarois, creams, blanc-manges, macédoines, charlottes and large cakes, and form another course. DESSERT. After the cold entremets come the dessert, composed of cheese, fresh fruits, preserved fruits, cakes, jams, dried fruits, candied fruits, bonbons, mottoes, papillotes, victorias, pyramids, frozen puddings, plombières, ices, ice cream and small fancy cakes, then the coffee and cordials.

The steward must inform and specify to the butler the wine to be served at each separate course. However, important the dinner may be, still decanters of ordinary red and white wine must be placed on the table. The selection of the finer wines is the host's duty, he making his choice when ordering the bill of fare. The steward's duty is to see that the wines are served at a proper temperature. All white wines must be served cold. Sherry and Xeres cool. Bordeaux between 52 and 60 degrees, Fahrenheit, according to its growth. Burgundy between 42 and 45 degrees. Champagnes, cold or iced, or in sherbets. Dessert wines cool. For choosing wines consult the table on wines of Delmonico's cellar.

Dessert. THE DINNER TABLE, RECEPTION TABLE SERVICE AND WINES. (Le Couvert, Réception, Service de Table et les Vins.) TABLE SERVICE FOR TWENTY-FOUR PERSONS. An oblong shaped table is preferable for a large dinner party, the feet being less incommodious; it must at least be six or seven feet wide and twenty-two feet long, with rounded ends. This shaped table is most generally used, although some prefer round, or horse-shoe ones, or an oblong with square ends, and many other fanciful shapes, depending entirely on the size of the room and the taste of the host. Tables can be lengthened according to the number of seats desired; the space allowed for each guest is, for a square, table with square ends, two feet apart between each plate; when the ends are curved, the space for the corners must be twenty-two inches apart, and if entirely round, twenty inches. Cover a table twenty-two by seven with a felt cover made for the purpose, then over this lay a tablecloth twenty-four feet long and eight or nine feet wide, being careful that it is exceedingly white and smooth, having no creases whatever. Fold a well starched, large napkin, pinch it triangularly, and place it in the center of the table; have twenty-four smaller napkins also well starched, folded and pinched, and place these at the edge of the table and on each one set a plate with another napkin on top, folded either shaped as a boat, a tulip, or any other pretty design, or else the napkin may be simply folded square. The bread is placed either under the folds or in the center of the napkin, according to the manner in which it is displayed, or on a small plate to the left of the cover. Another way is to place the bread in front of the napkin. On the left of each plate, lay a table fork and also a fish fork. On the right set a table knife, a silver fish knife, a soup spoon, also a small fork for oysters or Little Neck clams In front, but slightly toward the right of each plate, set a small individual salt-cellar. The double silver pepper castors containing black and red pepper are distributed two on each side, and two at each end of the table, with eight single ones between the double ones. Glasses are placed in a semi-circle either in front of the plate or else on the right; arrange these according to the courses to be served. First, water glass; second, white wine; third, sherry; fourth, Rhine wine; fifth, champagne; and sixth, Bordeaux. Before serving the entrées remove the white wine, Sherry and Rhine wine glasses and replace them by fine Bordeaux and Burgundy glasses. Glasses intended for dessert wines and liquors, are only put on the table with the dessert. THE CENTER LINE OF THE TABLE. In the center of the table have a large piece of silverware decorated with plants, ferns and natural flowers, or else a high vase or simply a basket of flowers. These baskets or other decorations may be filled with one, or several kinds of variegated flowers, mingling red and white, scarlet and lilac, or Parma violets, or tulips and orchids, these produce a brilliant effect. (The entire house, staircases, halls, etc., may also be decorated with plants, palms, lemon and orange trees, or rubber plants. Mantels and mirrors to be also wreathed with flowers, or else scattered about in clusters, and have hanging baskets tastefully arranged in prominent corners, so as to add to the general beautiful effect.) On each side of the center piece and on the center line have two prettily arranged baskets containing seasonable or hot-house fruits; on each side of these, set an ornamental piece, either made of nougat, gum-paste or sugar candy, or should these high pieces not be desirable, others may be substituted either of bronze, or else stands covered with flowers, etc. On each end of these pieces set either candelabras or lamps, and beyond these high stands of graduated tiers filled with bonbons, cornucopias, Victorias, bonbon boxes, etc., all of them forming the center line of the table. Around this line, and at about twenty to twenty-four inches from the edge, draw a line the same shape as the table, and on this place decanter stands for decantered wine; two for sherry, four for white wine, and four for red Bordeaux, making ten in all, and the same quantity of decanter stands for decanters containing water, or instead of ten, twenty-four smaller ones may be substituted, one for each person. Place at intervening spaces, two compote dishes with stewed fruits, four stands for small fancy cakes, two compote dishes for candied or dried fruits, nuts, etc., or else fresh strawberries, raspberries or mulberries, if in season, a saucerful for each person, and finish by interlacing through these dishes as well as the decanters, strings of smilax or any other pretty creeping vine, following around about twenty-four inches from the edge of the table; set into this verdure at various parts, clusters of natural flowers. A table arranged according to this description will be found to have a most charming and pleasing effect. The diagram of the table should be obtained, and have the names of each guest tastefully written on fancy cards; lay one of these on the right hand glass of each person, in a prominent manner so that it can be read from a distance which will greatly facilitate the seating of the guests. Procure bouquets of flowers for the ladies, set in fancy vases, tying them with ribbons, and having a pin attached to enable them to fasten them on to their dresses; gentlemen's button-hole bouquets should also be placed in vases. All these flowers must be in front, but slightly toward the left of each person. The bills of fare or menus should be placed on the left side, either in silver stands ( ), or set beside the plate. The host should always be seated so as to face the door leading into the dining-room. The hostess on the other end of the table directly opposite, their respective seats being at the top and bottom of the table. The seat of honor for a lady is on the right hand of the host, and naturally on the right hand of the hostess for a gentleman. The left hand may also be utilized as seats of honor but of minor importance. A dining room should be kept at a comfortable temperature. The sideboard should be placed at one side of the table, and on this or in the drawers and compartments everything must be arranged in thorough order so as to have them handy, thus avoiding all confusion during dinner. The entire dessert service including wines to be arranged tastefully on the sideboard, giving a very pretty effect to the room. A service table must either be in the dining-room behind a screen or in a pantry close by; it must contain one or several carving boards, sundry knives and forks, ladles, chafing dishes, etc. The service must be rapid and the dishes served hot; avoid having anything cooked in advance except the large pieces. Entrées and all smaller dishes should be prepared according to their successive order, as the dinner progresses, at an interval of two or three courses, which means about ten or twenty minutes apart. A good steward can always manage to protract the dinner in case the cook is behind time, but it is his duty to inform those in the kitchen at least ten minutes beforehand so as to prevent any possible delay; he must also have a duplicate bill of fare from the kitchen identical with the one on the table, and classified according to the service, so as to be able to consult it in order to know exactly which dish follows the other. When the dinner is ready, the steward must place his help in their respective positions, and give them final instructions regarding their duties; they should be attired in dress suits, white ties and gloves, and wear no jewelry whatever. In order to serve a ceremonial dinner for twenty-four persons, it will require: a steward, a butler, a carver and six waiters; carefully intrusting the care of the wines to the most intelligent, and the carving to the most expert; the remaining six being for the special table service, they must remain in their respective places to be at the call of the guests should their services be required. RECEPTION. The gentlemen are to be received by a waiter, who before introducing them into the reception room, takes their overcoats, canes, hats, umbrellas, etc., leaving these articles in a place set aside for this purpose, near the reception room, then hands each gentleman an envelope addressed to himself in which there will be found a card bearing the name of the lady he is to escort to the dining-room, and who is to be seated on his right hand during dinner. Two other waiters attired in full dress, introduce the gentlemen into the reception room adjoining the dining-room, the doors to the latter being closed; in the reception room there should be a small Russian buffet, or simply serve some sherry, Xeres, bitters, vermuth and absinthe, to be handed round on trays to each guest as he arrives. It is absolutely necessary to have a lady's maid to receive the ladies, lay aside their outer garments, or any article they may desire to confide to her care; these must be arranged in such a manner as to be easily returned to their respective owners. The maid must remain and wait, in order to be continually at the disposal of the lady guests. When all the invited guests have arrived and been duly introduced, the dinner hour having struck, the steward opens the dining-room doors, bows to the host, this being the signal to announce that dinner is served. The hostess enters the dining-room first, on the arm of the gentleman in whose honor the dinner is given, followed by the other guests, the host being last. Each one sits down at the seats indicated on the cards, and when all are comfortably seated the dinner begins. The service must be performed silently, a look alone from the steward sufficing for each man to do his duty. Every article handed round must be on a silver salver. THE SERVICE. Oysters. -Little Neck clams are passed around, beginning on one side by the lady on the right and the other side by the gentleman on the right, these being the most distinguished guests; change this method at each course, those being served last before, being the first now. The butler will pour out the Chablis, stating the name of each wine he serves. Soup. -There are usually two soups to select from. While serving green turtle offer at the same time lemon cut in quarters. Sherry should be served with this course. Side Dishes. -Pass hot hors-d'œuvre; these are served on warm plates. Serve the cold hors d'œuvre at the same time, and should the guest prefer the latter, remove the hot plate at once and substitute a cold one for it. Sherry or Xeres should accompany this course. Fish. -If there be two kinds of fish, offer the selection, and pass round the one preferred; should it be boiled or braized fish, have potatoes served at the same time; if broiled or sautéd thinly sliced seasoned fresh cucumbers must accompany it, and if fried fish such as whitebait, serve with thin slices of buttered brown bread and quarters of lemon. Serve Rhine wine or white Bordeaux. Removes or Solid Joints. -The removes may be placed on the table before being taken off for carving; if it be a saddle of venison, it should be cooked rare, passing currant jelly at the same time. A saddle of mutton must also be rare and very hot; it can be cut lengthwise at an angle in thin slices or across, although the first way is preferable; serve both these on very hot plates, and have one or two vegetables accompanying them. Serve champagne. Entrées. -The entrées must be served one after the other without placing them on the table beforehand; they must be served on hot plates with one vegetable for each entree, to be either passed round separately or else carefully laid on the same plate, unless it is desired that they be dressed; in this case dress and present to each guest. Serve Bordeaux at the first entrée, and an extra quality of wine at the last; continue serving champagne to those who prefer to drink it until the roast. INTERVAL. -SECOND SERVICE. Iced Punch or Sherbet. -Should there be no ladies present, cigarettes can be handed round at the same time. Remove the two white wine and sherry glasses, and replace them by those used for Burgundy, also remove the cold side dishes. Ten to fifteen minutes must now be allowed between the courses. Roasts. -The roast may be displayed on the table before carving, this being frequently requested by epicures; should there be several roasts, carve them all at the same time and pass them round according to desire, adding a little watercress for poultry, and should there be canvas-back duck, let currant jelly and fried hominy be served with also a mayonnaise of celery. Serve the Burgundy from bottles laid flat in baskets ( .) holding the basket in the right hand and a white napkin in the left. Cold. -Serve the cold dishes after the roast, these to be either goose livers (foies-gras) with truffles or boned turkey. The foies-gras must have a spoon to remove it with, and the boned turkey be cut into thin slices, and offer both to the guest at the same time, accompanied by green salads. Serve Johannisberg or Vin de Paille. Now remove everything from the table with the exception of the dessert, and to avoid using a brush lift up the extra napkins in front of each person, folding them in two so that the table is neat and clean without being obliged to use a brush or scraper. Lay the dessert plates on the table, and continue the service for the hot dessert. Hot Sweet Entremets. -Make a distinct service for the hot entremets, then serve the cheese. Serve a fine Laffitte Bordeaux. Cold Sweet Entremets. -Make another service for the cold entremets and ices. Dessert. -Instead of serving the cheese after the hot entremets it may be done now, which is in fact its proper place; pass around the fresh fruits, stewed, candied and dried fruits, bonbon cases, bonbons, mottoes, ices, strawberries and raspberries with cream when in season, passing cakes around at the same time. Serve Madeira wine, Muscatel and Frontignan, also plates of salted almonds. THE CONCLUSION OF THE DINNER. It is now time for the hostess to bow, push back her chair and prepare to rise, this being a signal for the ladies to retire; after they have returned to the drawing-room, coffee is passed round on a salver containing spoons, hot water, sugar and cream. A few moments later another waiter comes forward with an empty tray to remove the cups the ladies hand him. The gentlemen partake of their coffee in the dining-room; at the same time serve them Kirsch, brandy, chartreuse, cigars and cigarettes. The doors are closed and the ladies and waiters have retired so as to allow the gentlemen more freedom to talk among themselves, still it will be necessary to enter the drawing room and dining-room occasionally in order to see whether anything be needed so as to avoid being called as much as possible. After half an hour or so, the gentlemen will rejoin the ladies in the drawing-room and then tea is served. The tea service is accomplished by passing around on trays, tea, sugar, hot water, cream, cups, spoons and slices of lemon. A few moments later another waiter removes the empty cups on a tray. After the tea the service is considered to be ended. An illustration of a Nicely arranged Dining Table along with Eight Dining Chairs placed around it. FRENCH SERVICE (Service à la Française). There are two different services in use: The French and the Russian. Although recognizing the priority of both of these services, it will be well to mention the difference existing between them and the English and the American service; first, they differ in the classification of the bills of fare and certain changes in the table service, these alone are sufficient to be interesting. The old style of French service threatens to disappear entirely and is rarely used, except on very rare occasions. The three services placed on the table, one after the other, had certainly the advantage of displaying the culinary labor as well as the most variegated and rare products by exhibiting them in all their profuseness. But the great inconvenience is the preparation of dishes beforehand in the kitchen in order to have each service ready at once and to keep them hot in heaters before beginning to serve the dinner. The dishes for the first course are placed on the table in chafing dishes provided with covers, to be lifted off when the guests are seated, and left on the table till ready to be carved. Of course this inconvenience is somewhat remedied by keeping the heaters and chafing dishes at a given heat, and there must be placed near the table, either behind a screen in the dining-room or else in an adjoining pantry, a bain-marie with all the necessary sauces required for the dinner, and as soon as the meats are carved, each one is to be covered with its respective sauce before being handed around. But notwithstanding all possible care and attention the entrées are apt to lose much of their finer qualities by the very act of being cooked and dressed beforehand, then kept hot in these heaters or chafing dishes. Still this could scarcely have been the sole cause for abandoning the old system, for it continued in usage for several centuries. We are, however, obliged to recognize that first-class families have ceased to make a display of the great luxuriousness indulged in, in the past; to-day they are more restrained, the help less numerous and the chief cook frequently alone with one kitchen assistant, having no longer an extra man for pastry, confectionery and ices. The chef himself must see to the preparation of the pastry, ices and desserts. There are now scarcely to be found any house where for twelve persons they employ a chef, an assistant and a pastry cook and the remainder of the help corresponding to this great amount of luxury. The bills of fare are simpler; instead of dressing and arranging the service on the table itself, many houses have a mixed service; this is made by presenting the dishes on the table, then removing them to be carved. The general desire of the day is to dine quicker; taste changes with the fashion. The old French service is fast disappearing, and as it becomes more simple it gradually evolves into a mixed Russian and French service. FRENCH SERVICE FOR 24 PERSONS (Service à la Française pour 24 Couverts). The first service is composed of hors-d'œuve (side dishes), two soups, two removes, four hot entrées, or two cold and two hot entrées. Remove the cold hors-d'œuvre; serve the punch or sherbet. The second service is composed of two roasts to take the place of the removes; four entremets, two being of vegetables, one hot sweet entremets and one cold; these to replace the entrées; two entremets cakes to take the place of the cold entrées. Prepare the table for the dessert. The third service, or dessert, is composed of two shelved stands filled with bonbons, victorias, bonbon boxes, cossacks, two low stands or drums containing small fancy cakes, two basketfuls of fresh fruits, two assorted compotes, one orange jelly, one bar-le-due jelly and two cheeses; two fancy pieces of nougat or candied sugar to replace the entremets cakes. The wines should be selected and served as indicated in another chapter, according to the taste and desire of the host. FRENCH SERVICE, DINNER FOR 24 PERSONS -TO SET THE TABLE (Service à la Française, Dîner de 24 Couverts -Le Couvert). The table must be sixteen to eighteen feet long and six to seven feet wide, with rounded corners, covered with a table-cloth and having exactly in the center a high stand or epergne, or piece of silverware or bronze, filled with flowers. Continue the middle line with candelabras or lamps; leave a place for the chafing dishes and between these arrange the cold hors-d'œuvre. Set the plates, the glasses to form a semicircle in front; the spoons and knives on the right and the forks on the left. Commence serving the most honored guest on each right side, and begin each separate service at the person served the last. All the dishes intended for the table should be dressed tastefully and the edges decorated with open-worked noodle borders; the meats laid symmetrically, the borders to be neither too high nor too much spread so that the dish covers can fit on easily; light bread borders can also be used. Decorate the meats with trimmed hatelets just before placing them on the table. NECESSARY MATERIAL FOR 24 PERSONS (Matériel Nécessaire pour 24 Couverts). Let the china, glassware, silver, cutlery and linen be as much alike as possible, have the glasses all plain or cut of the same pattern and shape; the china either all white, colored or gilt; the linen plain or damasked with large or small designs. The plates must be changed at each service as well as the knives and forks, they must be washed immediately and used again for the following services, otherwise there will be as many knives and forks needed as plates, consequently far more material. 24 soup plates. 24 side-dish plates. 72 dinner plates. 48 dessert plates. 24 soupspoons. 24 coffee after-dinner cups. 24 dessert knives and forks. 72 large forks. 72 steel knives. 24 silver or gilt knives. 24 side-dish knives and forks. 24 coffeespoons Small salt cellars and pepper casters, one for each person. 12 radish dishes for 24 persons.

Around the Dining Table are Six Chairs. RUSSIAN SERVICE (Service à la Russe). The habit we have of eating everything very hot and very fast comes to us from the "Russian service;" it differs from the French service in the very fact that nothing hot appears on the table, everything is cut up as needed, either in the kitchen or pantry. The carving should be performed very neatly, having all the pieces of even size and placed at once symmetrically either in a circle or straight row on dishes for ten or less persons, then passed round to the guests, who help themselves or are helped, according to their wish. For the solid joints, removes or roasts, they can be served precisely the same, or else laid on very hot plates and handed directly to each guest. There must be a sufficiency of every kind of entrée to serve for every person present. Should there be several and a variety of roasts and only one service required, then carve a third part of each one, or more of one than the other if certain dishes seem to be preferred. If there be several removes the same course can be pursued. As soon as one course is being passed around, the following one should be brought from the kitchen so that the dinner can be served uninterruptedly and eaten while hot and palatable. The cold meat pieces may be dressed and arranged on the table the same as the candelabras, silverware, bronze vases and flower baskets, all of these to be in the center line of the table, leaving eighteen inches of space uncovered between the end of the line and the edge of the table; between this center line and the edge draw a round or oval or any other desirable shape at eighteen inches above the edge. If there be two cold meat pieces lay them on the sides of the table and in the center of the line, and if four, then two at the sides and two at the ends in the center, if eight then have four at the corners between the sides and ends on the eighteen-inch line above the edge; finish to decorate this line with cold sweet dishes, baskets of fresh fruits, shelved stands filled with bonbons, cossacks, Victorias, drums containing small fancy cakes, compoted dried fruits, etc., all these ornaments give the table a charming effect and should be arranged before the guests enter the dining-room. The straight line alone and the cold meat pieces can be also arranged, finishing at eighteen inches from the edge with garlands of leaves and flowers instead of the dessert, and when ready to serve the cold pieces, take them off and replace them by the taller desserts, shelved stands and drums, ranging the others here and there, half on either side of the table between the middle line and the flowers. Hot sweet entremets are always served as extras or "flying dishes," after the vegetables. The service is far less sumptuous and elegant than the French one, yet it pleases many and is very fashionable at the present time. The remainder of the service is exactly like the French. The old-fashioned bills of fare for the Russian service were classed differently to those of to-day; further on they will be found in great variety, appertaining to different epochs and a selection can be made of those most suitable; the service remains invariably the same, the only change being in the bill of fare. It is the custom in Russia to serve the iced punches or sherbets after the fish, but it is certainly preferable to wait until the entrées are removed. SUPPER. (Le Souper.) "To sleep easily one must sup lightly." SUPPER BUFFET. Supper buffets are dressed on tables twelve to twenty feet long by four to five feet wide; larger or smaller according to the number of guests and the richness of the bill of fare. Be careful that every article on the table shows to the best advantage, arranging each dish in a tasteful manner, yet observing certain indispensable rules so to facilitate the service that the buffet can be replenished and the dishes removed without the slightest confusion. The warm dishes should be served continuously without any delay and only a few at the time. Place a large piece of silverware in the center of the table to contain fruits, following the middle line on the length, then two large baskets of flowers and two pieces either of nougat or sugar, both ornamented with candied fruits, then two large cold-meat pieces and two stands filled with bonbon boxes, mottoes, victorias and bonbons, afterward two candelabras, and two entremets cakes to finish. In the front place a decorated salmon, behind on the other side of the center line stand the tenderloin of beef, and on each side of the fish and tenderloin, two medium-sized meat pieces, then the drums or high stands filled with small cakes. After this the small cold entrées, such as sandwiches and small rolls filled with rillettes; at each end of the table arrange the chicken and lobster salads. On one end of the table have plenty of material handy (according to the importance of the bill of fare), for hot service; have plates, soup tureens and chafing-dishes; behind, near the tenderloin of beef, put the ices, jellies and charlottes. These suppers are usually served after the first part of the dancing order is finished between eleven o'clock and one in the morning. Frequently small tables are used when there is sufficient room; these are generally reserved for the ladies. HOT DISHES. First part. -The soup is either consommé in cups, or barley cream, or rice and almond milk. These must be perfectly clear in order to serve them in cups the same as the consommé. Oysters prepared in different styles: Fricasseed, Hollandaise, Béchamel, poulette, Viennese, crawfish sauce, etc.; oysters fried or stuffed, small bouchées filled with salpicon, chicken or game croquettes, sweetbreads, lobster, etc., Timbales and mousselines; terrapin, Maryland or Newburg for white, Baltimore and Maryland Club for brown; red-head ducks and canvas-back, also quails and squabs and sometimes deviled crabs, stuffed lobsters, scallops à la Brestoise or frog croquettes. COLD DISHES. Second part. -Decorate the table with hors-d'œuvre composed of radishes, olives, celery, anchovy toasts etc. Large pieces such as a richly decorated salmon, a tenderloin of beef garnished with vegetables, boned turkey and capon, ham stuffed with pistachio nuts and truffles, a suckling pig, a boar's head, large dishes of turkey and capon, truffled or otherwise. Volières of peacock, young swans, pheasants and guinea fowls ornamented with their natural feathers, large terrines of Strasburg foies-gras, woodcock, snipe, reedbirds, quails, leverets, veal kernels and game "pains," en damier; bastions of roast game on croûtons and garnished with fresh water-cress, pyramids of lobsters and crawfish and truffles. There are a great variety of elegant entrées, and among others the following ones may be selected: Aspics of all kinds, red beef tongue, foies-gras, fillets of chickens, oysters, etc.; white and brown chaufroids of partridge and chicken, also ravigote ducks, galantines of chicken, cream of pigeons, squabs and quails covered with chaufroid and decorated with black truffles and very green pistachio nuts; smoked and unsmoked tongue well glazed and dressed pyramid form; lamb chops au vert pré, ballotines of quails and squabs, ducklings pear shaped and thrushes à la Périgord; terrines of Nérac and ducks' livers à la Toulouse and young rabbit à la mode de Rouen; pains of chicken or game. Entrées of larks and reedbirds, chicken mayonnaise; lobster, shrimp, crab and salmon salads, also salad à la Russe, and at equal distances have plates of small breads garnished with rillettes and fine sandwiches. Select from all this gastronomical wealth those dishes liable to satisfy the appetite and at the same time make a beautiful display on the table. SWEET ENTREMETS AND DESSERTS. Third part. -Intersperse among the cold dishes, liquor and fruit jellies, bavarois, "pains" of rice puddings, blanc-manges and charlotte russes, assorted creams and crowns, waffles filled with whipped cream, macédoines, assorted large dessert cakes, and timbales of waffles, brisselets and wheelbarrows of small méringues with flowers or fruits, horn of plenty and Sultan vases, cherry baskets, high mounted pieces of gum paste, royal icing, nougat, sugar candy, marchpane and almond paste. Fancy variegated ices, such as virgin cream and biscuit glacés, tutti-frutti, Montelimar, Neapolitan, harlequin, bombs and delicious creams with nuts; parfait with coffee and burnt almond cream, chestnut mousse and soufflés sabayon; sponge and plombière with fruits, Nesselrode puddings and fiori di latte; pineapple water ices and Favart soufflés; fresh, seasonable and hot-house fruits; compotes of fruits, small fancy cakes, Genoese cakes and others iced; bonbons, Victorias, cornucopias, Cossacks, mottoes and bonbon boxes. This third part of the menu is certainly the prettiest and most coquettish, and with these luxuries ends the selection of dishes from which an elegant table may be set. Drinks. -Champagne, Bordeaux, Burgundy, wine punches, lemonades, grenadine and syrups of raspberry, currant or orgeat, coffee or tea. AMBIGU. A meal usually offered cold without any soup, and set on a table where removes are served at the same time, also entrées, side dishes and sweet desserts, and in which the service is blended into one, for no dishes are to be removed. Certain breakfast, hunting luncheons, and suppers served in the midst of a ball, are also all called ambigu. SERVICE FOR LUNCHEONS. Lunch is a small repast indulged in between breakfast and dinner. This meal is called lunch in English, in French goûter or taste, because it is less heavy than the others, and, as generally very little is eaten, it is only tasted. In France this old custom only exists in country towns where breakfast is very matinal; the English and Americans also lunch, for they breakfast early and only dine toward six or seven o'clock, therefore lunch is an indispensable meal with them. Larger and more ceremonious luncheons are frequently served; these are called "dinner luncheons," and many bills of fare for their preparation will be found later on. For family luncheons there are generally served cold meats, light entrées, sandwiches, pastries, ices, preserves, etc., LUNCHEON FOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OR FOR LADIES ONLY, OR GENTLEMEN ONLY. FOR LADIES ONLY. Although set with more simplicity than the dinner table, nothing elegant must be lacking; in the center of the table place a flower decoration, either a double cornicopia, or a boat, or two dossers set back to back, or a vase, or a temple, etc., according to the reason the lunch was offered to the guests. On each side place a piece made of nougat, one of spun sugar, and at each end a high stand on tiers filled with bonbons, Victorias, mottoes, etc. At eighteen or twenty-four inches from the edge, according to the width of the table, draw a line the same shape as the table and lay on this decanters of white and sherry wines, also water decanters, one for every two persons; two fruit dishes, four containing small fancy cakes, and two of dried fruits. Set semicircular around each plate as many glasses as there are wines; on the right hand lay a card bearing the name of the guest, and on the left a dress or buttonhole bouquet and the menu standing against the flower vase. Decorate the sideboard with the dessert service; carve the meats near the dining-room, and see that everything is served very hot. Let the wines be of a proper temperature, and specify each one while serving it; as soon as everything is in complete order, open the doors and bow, which means that the lunch is ready, and the guests may assemble in the dining-room to take their places at the seats designated on their cards. The service begins the same as the dinner and continues likewise until the coffee is served, when the ladies retire to the drawing-room to partake of theirs, to listen to music, or to withdraw unceremoniously. If the lunch should be intended for gentlemen only, suppress all ornamentation except the flowers and fruits; the menu should be more substantial, and if for ladies and gentlemen together, serve the same as for a dinner, observing the same etiquette. MEAT BREAKFAST (Déjeuner à la Fourchette). A meat breakfast is composed of broiled meats, cold meat, fish, eggs, croustades, fried dishes, sweets and dessert. BILL OF FARE. COLD SIDE DISHES. -MELON.

If so far no eggs have been mentioned in the bill of fare, then fruit or spirituous omelets of all kinds may be served, or else Celestine omelet, snow soufflé, etc., but in case eggs have already been used, then diversify the bill of fare by giving fritters, crusts, pancakes, pears, apples, peaches, etc. Have also pies, tarts and cakes as well as cheese and fresh fruit. Coffee and Liquors. THE BREAKFAST TABLE. The breakfast table must be laid simpler, although with as much care and taste as for all other meals; naturally there is less ceremony to be observed for a breakfast, the simplicity of the bill of fare and wines rendering it far easier to serve. The hors-d'œuvre and fruit may be placed on the table, and when a dressy appearance is desired, flowers or high cold pieces, such as meat pies, chaufroids, aspics, trout or salmon, may also be added. The service for the wines and cooking is exactly the same as for a dinner. SUPPLIES (Approvisionnements). Good cooking is only obtained by having all the ingredients healthy, appetizing and nutritious; the stomach must not be fatigued, and yet the eye and the palate have to be somewhat flattered. A dish may be more or less simple, more or less difficult, but it must satisfy the taste and to obtain this result a cook should only use the best materials and those of the very freshest. All the supplies should be of the very first choice; the best cook in the world can fail to work properly unless the provisions are of the best. A cook anxious to perform his duty must pay the strictest attention to the selection of the food; this alone constitutes a science based on a deep knowledge and long practice. Beef must have light red, marbled meat, the fat being firm to the touch. Veal meat to be white and firm, also its fat. Mutton has red meat firm and marbled, the fat to be white. Pork must be carefully selected from pigs raised on acorns or corn, having firm, white meat, and firm, white, brittle fat. Chickens to be plump, the breast bone flexible, the ribs easily cracked. Pinch the pinion bones to see whether they are tender; the same of turkeys, other poultry and game. Old fowls can never replace young chickens, therefore use them as little as possible. A fish is to have a clear, fresh eye and must be firm to the touch; mistrust it as soon as the belly flesh becomes soft; the smell will indicate whether it be fresh or stale; the same of crustaceans. Vegetables to be selected of the very freshest. Fruits by their appearance and taste. TABLE OF SUPPLIES. FISH AND SHELL FISH. Index for American Fish and when they are in Season.

The heading of each recipe being in English and in French permits any person not thoroughly versed in both these languages to compose his bill of fare in either the one or the other. He has simply to make his selection of the necessary recipe and by referring to the number of the article, write his bill of fare in English or in French as he so chooses. In wording a dinner bill of fare be very careful to denote the fish or shell fish, the butcher's meat, the poultry and game in season, alternating white or brown for each course, also the white or brown sauces. I have as far as practicable replaced the term fillet by breasts for poultry or game and aiguillettes for fish, so that the word fillet need not be too frequently repeated in the same bill of fare. Oysters can be omitted from the bills of fare, also cold side dishes, salads and coffee, besides the details of the dessert following the entremets need only be mentioned by the single word of dessert. ELEMENTARY METHODS. . BURNT ALMONDS AND PILBERTS (Amandes et Avelines Pralinées). Split some shelled almonds or filberts in two; if almonds are used mince well and roast lightly in the oven, on a baking sheet without letting them color, then mix in with them half their weight of sugar and enough egg-white, so they be entirely covered by the sugar. When the burnt almonds are spread on cakes, they must be covered over with sugar and glazed in a brisk oven. . CONDÉ ALMOND OR FILBERT PREPARATION (Appareil à Condé aux Amandes ou Aux Avelines). Put into a vessel three ounces of powdered sugar, one ounce of vanilla sugar, four ounces of icing sugar. Dilute this compound gradually with egg-whites, in such a manner that a smooth running paste is obtained, and beat it well for several minutes, so that it becomes a consistent body. To this add six ounces of dry almonds or filberts, shelled, ground or chopped up very fine. . TO CHOP AND SHRED ALMONDS. (Pour Hacher et Effiler les Amandes). Chopped. -When the almonds are partly dry, chop them up and sift them through a sieve (  ), chop again all that remains on the sieve and continue until there be no more to pass through. Shredded Almonds. -Are freshly peeled almonds dried well in a cloth, then cut into thin fillets on their length, or else put them into a special machine that shreds them also, but they never look so well, as the machine cuts them into all sorts of shapes, while with the knife, they are cut into uniform lengths. . ALMOND MILK (Lait d'Amandes). Pound half a pound of almonds with a few spoonfuls of cold water and two spoonfuls of orange-flower water; prepare a very fine paste with this and dilute with a pint of water; strain the liquid forcibly through a napkin. . TO PEEL ALMONDS, PISTACHIOS OR FILBERTS (Pour Monder les Amandes, Pistaches ou Avelines). In order to remove the peels from almonds, filberts or pistachio nuts, they must first be plunged into boiling water and left on the fire until the skin detaches easily under the pressure of the finger, then drain and refresh in cold water; now drain and peel them by removing the skins wash in cold water, drain, wipe and dry in the heater or in a well aired place. For Filberts or Nuts. -To be peeled dry, crack the shells with a nut -cracking machine, being careful not to break the kernel, then peel them dry by putting the nuts on a baking sheet and pushing it into a medium oven, removing them immediately the outer skin detaches when the nut is rubbed between the thumb and first finger; keep them either whole or in halves and use for ice cream and desserts. Those peeled in water are for chopping, or splitting in two for nougats, also for cooked sugar pastes. . TO POUND, CRUSH, AND COLOR ALMONDS (Pour Piler Broyer et Colorer les Amandes). To Pound. - Almonds are pounded in a mortar or crushed in a machine; in the mortar by wetting a few at the time with either eggs or liquids, then stirring in some sugar. In a machine, by mixing the almonds and sugar together and pouring it into the funnel of the machine; the first time they should be barely crushed, pass through four times, tightening the cylinders slightly for each turn, and the last time the almonds should be reduced to a paste. To Color Almonds. -Use chopped or shredded almonds for coloring. For pink, dilute a little carmine in some thirty degree syrup with a little kirsch; rub the almonds in this and dry them. For violet, use red, blue and maraschino; for orange, yellow, red and curaçao; for lemon color, yellow and noyau; and for green, spinach and orange flower water. . TO BLANCH RICE (Pour Blanchir le Riz). Before blanching rice it should be picked, washed, then put into a saucepan and moistened with cold water; bring the liquid to boiling point, stirring it frequently with a spoon so it does not adhere to the bottom of the saucepan, and let it boil for seven or eight minutes, pour the rice into a sieve to drain, refresh in cold water and strain. . TO BLANCH VEGETABLES (Pour Blanchir les Légumes). Vegetables are blanched in more or less time according to their nature, and not only to correct their bitterness, but to soften them as well; the blanching is the prologue of the cooking and is accomplished in boiling, salted water, either in a saucepan, a tinned copper pan, a copper untinned pan, or an untinned saucepan. In the copper and untinned pans, only the green vegetables should be cooked, such as spinach, green peas, string beans , fresh asparagus, in fact all vegetables that must retain a pretty, pale green color. Artichokes should be cooked in a very clean well-tinned saucepan. To blanch parsley, chervil, tarragon, onions, shallots, etc., plunge them in boiling water several times. . TO BONE POULTRY OR GAME (Pour Déosser la Volaille et le Gibier). Poultry or game are generally boned in order to stuff them properly; they must first be singed lightly, the legs cut off as well as the pinions and neck, keeping the skin of the latter as long as possible; split the skin right along the back so as to free the carcass on both sides, using a small knife for this purpose, afterward separate the stump from each wing, so as to reach the fillets. When the fore-part of the belly is detached, separate also the thighs by dislocating them at the first joint adhering to the carcass, then bone the fleshy part of the thighs and the drum -sticks. Cut the carcass down as far as the rump, so as to detach it entirely, and if these instructions are strictly followed, the piece of poultry or game will be found to be entirely boned, and the only parts now to be removed are the stumps of the wings and the large nerve found in the flesh of the thighs, and detach from the carcass the two minion fillets from which you remove the nerves. . DISH BORDERS OF NOODLE PASTE, COOKED PASTE, METAL, ENGLISH PASTE OR GUM PASTE, DISH BOTTOMS, FOUNDATIONS, SUPPORTS, TRIANGLE FOR DRESSING TONGUES, HATELETS FOR HOT REMOVES AND ENTREES, FANCY FRILLS, AND FAVOR FRILLS (Bordures de Plat en Nouilles Pâte Cuite, et en Métal, Pâte Anglaise et Pastillage, Fonds de Plats et Supports, Croûton Triangle pour Dresser les Langues, Hâtelets pour Relevés et Entrées Chauds, Bouffettes et Manchettes). Several kinds of borders are used in the kitchen for the purpose of decorating dishes; those most employed are cut out with a pastry cutter from a band of noodle paste To make noodle paste borders requires ingenuity, although it is not difficult. First it needs a good noodle paste of a fine color and very smooth; divide it in several parts and roll these into sausage shapes, then flatten down with a rolling pin drawing them out to a sufficient length so the band can reach all around the basin of the dish; then cut these bands into the desired width keeping them exceedingly straight; roll them over on themselves without pressing, then unroll slowly on to a paper band to design them with a cutter (  ), rolling up the cut out end as soon as finished to prevent the paste from drying; they may also be molded in molds shown in  .   An illustration of a pattern used in making Noodle Paste Borders.   An illustration of a pattern used in making Noodle Paste Borders. To fasten the border onto the dish, push a string of repère through a cornet around the basin of the dish exactly where the border is to stand upright; place the dish on top of a cool part of the range and unroll the cut-out band speedily onto the repère to fasten it on in an upright position, attach the two ends together, then bend the band outward with the fingers to give it sufficient splay, turning it around all the time until it is dry enough to stand by itself, then cover over to prevent the border from drying. Another style of border (  ) greatly admired is made of cooked white paste also carved out with the pastry cutter, but under more simple conditions and is more resisting. These are very appropriate for entrées having an abundance of garnishing or a plentiful supply of gravy, thereby requiring a more resisting substance than noodle paste. This kind can be seen in the different entrées illustrated in this work, but more specially in the figure representing a chicken à la Montesquieu (  ). But a style even more used and certainly far more practical is a border made of metal ( Figs. 4-5-6); they are fit to be served at a family dinner as well as at the most luxurious banquet in which the dishes are invariably handed round to the guests, for instance those viands dressed in the kitchen. These borders are movable and should be made the same size as the basin of the dish for which it is intended. These borders are of sterling silver, but they can be imitated in plated ware; let it be well understood that these borders can only be placed on metal, silver or plated dishes.  ,  ,  ,  . Illustrations of Different Borders for Dishes made up of Metals. For Borders of English Paste or Gum Paste. -Roll out the paste to the desired thickness and with a fancy cutter (  A) cut out some pieces and dry them on an even surface covered with paper; when finished place them in closed boxes in a dry place and when ready to use push a string of royal icing on the edge of the basin of the dish or platform and dress the border very evenly around.  A. An illustration of a Nice Pattern used in Making Borders of Gum paste. Dish Bottoms, Foundations and Supports. -These foundations or dish bottoms serve for dressing pieces, removes or entrées, so to raise them and give them a more elegant appearance. They are to be made either of bread, rice, hominy, wood or tin. Round ones for entrées and ovals for removes for large roasts. The height for entrées is about one and a half inches, while for removes they are to be two inches; those of wood or tin are to be covered with noodle paste, those of rice or hominy are sculptured or carved with a knife.  ,  . Illustrations of Different Dish Bottoms. Molded supports are to be prepared for boned turkeys, capon, pullet, etc.; these are of an oblong shape, rounded at the ends (See  A.); the longest ones intended for turkey's are nine and a quarter inches long by four and three quarters wide and two and a quarter high; for capons they are to be nine inches long, four and a half wide and two inches high; for tenderloins of beef, ten inches long by four wide and two and a half high; for hams, they are oval shaped, twelve by nine and three high.  ,  A. Illustrations of Different Molds use for Different Kinds of Food. Triangle for Dressing Tongues, etc. -For the largest ones have the three sides of the triangle each twelve inches long; the thickness at the base is three inches and two inches at the top; they can be made either of rice or hominy in molds having the required dimensions (  ), or else lower ones with the following proportions: length at the base, twelve inches by eight high; cut off an inch and a half from the top of the smallest and three inches from the largest; this will form a platform for placing the subjects on. They can also be made of bread spread over with green butter and then heavily strewn with very finely chopped green parsley. Let it be well understood that the socles called dish bottoms are not intended to be eaten. The socle has nothing whatever to do with the dish itself; it represents an accessory made for the purpose of raising the meats, etc., dressed over it, showing off advantageously the surrounding garnishing.  . An illustration of a Triangular Pattern used for Dressing Tongues. Hâtelets (Skewers) for Hot Removes and Entrées. -Hâtelets are employed either as an ornament or else a garnishing; they are applied to removes and entrée dishes. Hâtelets should only be used on ceremonious occasions, for a too prodigal use of them is apt to decrease their value. They are ornamented with unpeeled truffles, mushrooms, or cock's combs, either plain or double hâtelets are also composed of Villeroi quenelles, sweetbread croquettes, or glazed crawfish; they are also made of vegetables, carrots, turnips and artichoke bottoms slightly blanched. Hâtelets in tended for garnishing cold pieces are to be found in the chapter on cold dishes .  . An illustration of a Hatler in a Flowery Pattern. Fancy Frills for Large Pieces, such as Leg of Mutton, Ham, etc. -Cut a band of paper twelve inches long by three and a half wide; fold it in two on its length and again in two, this making a seven-eighths of an inch wide band, cut it finely on the folded edge, or else pass it through a cutting machine; unfold the band, turn it over so that the cutting detaches better, then twist this band in a spiral around a tin tube; fasten the end with a little mucilage, take it off the tube and place inside either a straight or turned up sconce. To make these sconces, fold a thin sheet of paper six inches square in two, then in four, then again fold in a triangle, beginning at the pointed ends, fold it once more. Cut the paper pointed shaped beginning from the center and rounding toward the bottom; unfold, and with the blade of a small knife, press down each fold so as to have them all come on one side and thus form a kind of pointed funnel. Unite the points one on to the other, closing and pressing them together; they should now be the same shape as when cut; place one in the  ,  . Illustrations of Fancy Frills used for Large Food Items. corner of a fine towel, fold it over, press down heavily with the palm of the left hand, then pullthe napkin quickly away with the right hand; by this operation, and the pressure, the paper is both folded and goffered at once; the sconce is now made and it only requires to have the bottom cut off to fit it into the frill. (See   and 14.)  ,  . Illustrations of Different Fancy Frills use for Smaller Items of Food. Fancy Frills for Cutlets, Chicken Legs or Wings. -Cut some sheets of paper five inches long by three inches wide, fold in two across the length; fold once more in two; cut them by clipping in slits one thirty-second of an inch apart, or else use the machine. Fold this band, twining it in such a manner that the slits are rounded, then fasten with a little mucilage; roll the frill spiralwise on a column-tube or a piece of round wood three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Attach the end of the paper with a little mucilage and when the frill is properly fastened, cut the ends off straight so that they are all of one length (  ). Favor Frills. -Have a small piece of rounded wood an eighth of an inch in diameter and an inch and three-quarters long, tapered on one end; roll on this spiralwise, some prepared paper a third smaller than for the other frills; fasten the two ends together on the stick and trim the paper adhering to the stick with a small ribbon fastened on in the shape of a little rosette. These favors are for chicken-breasts, lobster cutlets, etc. . TO PREPARE BOUCHÉES (Pour Préparer les Bouchées). Roll out on a flour ed table some six turned puff paste , keeping it one quarter of an inch in thickness; let this paste rest, and then cut from it a dozen round pieces, using a channeled pastry cutter, from two, to two and a quarter inches in diameter (  ). Turn these over on to a wet baking sheet, leaving them a short distance apart, and egg over the surfaces with a brush. Trace on them quickly a ring using a smooth, well heated pastry cutter (  ), so that the incision is clear, and with a small knife trace three lines in the inside of this ring (  ); put the baking sheet into an oven, not excessively hot, and cook the bouchées for eighteen to twenty minutes; detach them from the baking sheet, slipping a knife underneath each one, open at once to empty them, save the covers, and keep warm until needed.  ,  ,  . Illustrations of Different Kinds of Pastry Cutters. . TO BRAIZE OR POÉLER, SMOTHER OR SAUTER (Pour Braiser, Poêler, Étuver ou Sauter). Braizing meat is to cook a piece of meat in a saucepan, lining the bottom with bardes or slices of fat pork, slices of veal, carrots and onions cut in slices, a bunch of parsley garnished with bay leaves, a little thyme, chives and one onion with cloves in it. Arrange the meat, fowl or game on top of these and moisten with some broth, then re-cover the meat with more bardes of fat pork; these meats must be cooked slowly in a slack oven, or by placing hot coals on the cover. Poéler. -Cut up one pound of breast of pork and half a pound of raw ham, into half inch squares; six ounces of carrot, four ounces of onion in half inch squares, two bay leaves, the same quantity of thyme, a bit of mace, two cloves and some basil, the whole of these aromatics tied inside a bunch of parsley. Melt the pork with the vegetables and bouquet, not letting it color, then place on top a fat pullet prepared and trussed as for an entrée, covering the breasts with slices of peeled lemon, and bardes of fat pork tied on with a string; pour over some fat broth from the stock -pot and also some white broth to moisten to half the height, being careful to renew the moistening at times so that the same quantity always remains. Smothering meat is to cook it slowly in a good stock without evaporation taking place, so that it cooks entirely and retains its natural flavor. Smothered meats must always be thoroughly cooked. Sauter. -Either in a sauteuse or in a pan; let the article cook rapidly on a quick fire tossing backward, forward, and frequently. We sauté potatoes , etc. Chickens or tenderloin are sautéd either in fat or oil on a moderate, but well regulated fire, turning the meats over when they are a fine color. . TO BREAD WITH BREAD CRUMBS, ENGLISH, FLOUR, MILANESE CRACKERS AND DEVILED (Pour Paner à la Panure, à l'Anglaise, à la Farine, à la Milanaise, à la Poudre de Cracker et à la Diable). Bread Crumbs. -We generally bread crumb all substances that are to be broiled or fried; if for broiling, they must first be coated with oil or melted butter, then laid in bread crumbs, or white breading, or else in bread raspings, or brown crumbs as explained below. For substances to be fried, such as croquettes, roll them first in white bread crumbs, then dip them in beaten eggs strained through a Chinese strainer, or else put four eggs in a bowl with salt, pepper, a tablespoonful of oil, the same quantity of water, and strain all through a strainer. Drain quickly and roll them again in white bread crumbs, and smooth the surfaces either by rolling them on a table or else use the blade of a knife. To Bread Crumb, English Style. -Use only the yolk of the eggs instead of whole ones, mixing for each ten yolks, ten ounces of melted butter. White Bread Crumb. -Is used for breading meats, fish and all substances to be fried; this breading is prepared with slightly stale bread, cutting off the crusts, and grating or rubbing the crumbs in a cloth, then passing it through a sieve (  ), it must be kept in a cool, dry place, spreading it out and stirring at times. Brown Bread Crumbs. -Is prepared with white bread dried in a heater and slightly browned in a very slack oven and afterward pounded and sifted through a sieve (  ). To Bread with Flour. -Dip the articles such as fish, etc., in seasoned milk, then roll them in flour. For egg -plant, roll them merely in flour, omitting the milk. To Bread Crumb à la Milanaise. -Mix bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese, half and half; dip the substances to be breaded, in melted butter, then lay them in the cheese and bread-crumb mixture, equalizing well the crumbs with the blade of a knife. To Bread with Powdered Crackers. -Dip the substance in beaten egg and its equal quantity of milk and then roll them in powdered crackers. To Bread à la Diable (deviled). -Season first the substances, then coat them over with mustard and dip them in beaten eggs and roll them lastly in bread-crumbs. . BREASTS OF PORK SALTED AND SMOKED, ENGLISH BACON (Lard de Poitrine Salé et Fumé. Petit salé à l'Anglaise). If needed for summer use, begin toward the end of March to dry- salt some breasts of pork for four days, then pack them tight in a salting tub and cover over with a thin layer of salt. Pour over them a freshly made, and highly salted brine, place on top a perforated cover, and lay over some heavy stones, so that the breasts are entirely submerged, and leave them in this state until needed, setting the tub in a cool well-aired place. This salt pork will keep well until the fall, although it will be much saltier than if prepared in the usual way. The usual way is to wash the breasts and put them in brine in a special salting tub without any other meat; use a fork to remove them from the brine, as the hands cause fermentation, and when the salt pork is needed for use, it can be unsalted in cold water for several hours or till sufficiently done. Bacon or smoked salt pork is prepared the same, putting it in a brine half as strong and keeping it in a 50 degree Fahrenheit temperature, but no more. Drain and dry in an aired place, then smoke for three days in the cold. . BRINE (Saumure). Brine is used for the preservation of meats and at the same time to give them the taste of any preferred aroma; for this reason we select among the many ways that are employed in different countries, one that we are sure will answer for our present needs. Boil in a large kettle twenty-five quarts of water, twenty-four pounds of salt, two pounds of saltpetre, three pounds of brown sugar and two ounces of carbonate of soda. Into a bag put a mixture weighing ten ounces, including thyme, bayleaf, sage, rosemary, juniper berries, savory, having more of each as desired, or less, if a certain taste displeases. After the salt is dissolved, leave the liquid to cool and then weigh it with a salt weight; with this it should be twelve degrees. To salt the meats, be careful to accomplish this when dry, by rubbing the meat with salt and a little saltpetre and then let rest for twenty-four hours before putting it in brine. Strain the brine and cover all the salted parts and leave it in a cool place during the operation. The time needed for salting is according to the size of the pieces. A ham weighing seventeen pounds requires twenty-five days; a breast weighing twelve pounds requires fifteen days; a shoulder weighing fifteen pounds requires twenty days. These indications are for meats to be eaten unsmoked. In case they should be smoked leave them ten days longer. Soak for twelve hours in cold water and then hang them in a smoking room or else in a big chimney, having them smoke slowly with oak shavings mixed with thyme, bayleaf, sage, etc. To Salt Hams. -Put into a large kettle one pound of salt, four ounces of saltpetre, six ounces of brown sugar, thyme, bayleaf, basil, two ounces of juniper berries, a quarter of an ounce of botanic calament, all tied up in a bag, and when the salt has dissolved by boiling, remove from the fire, let cool to settle the brine and then pour off the clear part. Burn some aromatic herbs in a barrel, put in the hams, pour the brine, already strained through a sieve, over, close the barrel and leave it for eighteen days; drain out the hams, hang them up for twelve days in a well-aired cool place, then hang them in the chimney for twenty days. Wrap them in sheets of paper and hang in a dry place. For Winter Hams. -These hams can only be kept during the winter. Have two hundred pounds of small corn-fed hams; rub over well with salt, then put them into a barrel and leave them for three days in a very cool place. Three days later put them into another barrel, cover over with salt brine, having sufficient salt to allow a potato to float on the surface; the hams must be entirely immersed in the brine, cover with a board and a weight atop. Twelve days after change them into another barrel and pour the brine again over, this is so that they change positions and salt easier. After another lapse of twelve days, drain and put them to soak in cold water for twelve hours; drain once more, leave to dry in the open air for eight days, then smoke them in a smoke house for two days with hickory wood. . CLARIFIED AND PURIFIED BUTTER (Beurre Clarifié et Épuré). Clarified. -To clarify butter it should first be melted so as to extract all the buttermilk, letting it cook slowly; skim and when well despumated from all its impurities and it begins to smoke then it is ready; strain it through a fine piece of linen and keep to use when needed. Purified. -Melt some butter in a deep saucepan, boil it for two or three minutes, remove, let stand to settle, then skim and pass it through a fine sieve pouring off the top only so to leave the sediment on the bottom. . BUTTER FOR BUTTERING MOLDS (Beurre Pour Beurrer les Moules). Melt one pound of veal kidney suet by chopping it up finely, then putting it into a saucepan with half a pint of water on a slow fire, stir occasionally to prevent its fastening on to the bottom of the saucepan and when the fat is limpid, add the same weight of fresh, saltless butter; stir until the butter and fat are perfectly clear. Cold Butter for Buttering Molds. -It suffices only to knead some un salted butter on the table to extract all its moisture and give it body, then put it into a cloth, sponge it off, put it in a pan in a warm temperature and work it until it becomes soft as cream. . TO PREPARE LIQUID CARAMEL (Caramel Liquide). Liquid caramel is most necessary; it is used for coloring broths, gravies and even sauces, when their tints are found to be too light, still caramel should be used with discretion, for it is apt to give a bitter taste to the colored liquids into which it is added. Put a few spoonfuls of powdered sugar into a copper pan, stir it over a slow fire, then remove it on to a slower one to let cook until it becomes quite brown, and the smoke arising from it is whitish, this is a sign that it is thoroughly done. Take the pan from off the fire, moisten the sugar proportionately with hot water, and allow the liquid to boil while stirring, and cook till the consistence of a light syrup is obtained. Caramel should be kept in a small, well-closed bottle, having a cork perforated lengthwise, so that when the bottle is turned over, the liquid can drop out slowly without it being necessary to uncork it. . TO CARVE ON THE TABLE (Pour Découper à Table). Carving should be done with ease and dexterity. It is a simple operation, yet to be a perfect carver one must have a few ideas of the natural construction of the various pieces to be cut up. The meat to be carved must be laid on a dish without any sauce or garnishing, so as to be able to turn it around to the most convenient position. The tools indispensable for carving consist of a solid two or three-pronged fork, a good, keen, sharp-bladed knife and a pair of carving scissors. It is essential to begin on the most practical side, and also to be able to distinguish all of the best parts so as to carve without deteriorating from their appearance or without injuring their gastronomical qualities. FIGS. 19 AND 20. An illustration of a Fork and a Knife Pointing in the same Direction. 8" Handwritten Inscription  ,  . An illustration of Two Kitchen Utensils Similar to the Shape of Scissors. It is an easy study, but one that ought not to be neglected, for what embarrasses and confuses a carver is when he is unable to find the different joints, or else when he begins cutting a piece of meat against the grain. It is to facilitate this operation that we deem it necessary to give a few hints and suggestions, and as almost each piece is accompanied by a design, it will be easy to learn how to carve those meats usually served whole on the table. . FISH; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper le Poisson). A general rule almost always observed for cutting up fish at table, is to use only silver implements; this to be specially followed for boiled and braised fish. Fried fish is the only kind where knives are allowable. To carve boiled fish, use either a silver fish slice, spoon or fork. The lines traced on the back of the fish (  ) denote in what direction it must be cut, observing, as the figure indicates, that it should be on the opposite side to the belly, for on this part the fleshiest meat is found. To cut up a bass, salmon, etc., or any fish of a long shape, first trace a line following the course of the bone, beginning at the head and finishing at the tail, then divide this back piece into slices and lay each one on a separate plate. All meats taken from the back and sides of a fish are fleshier and preferable to those found on the belly.  . An illustration of a Large Fish with Different Dotted Lines on the Front Portion of the Body. Fish slice. -A name given to a certain utensil with which fish is cut at the table to serve it on plates. These slices are made of silver or silver-plate; the blade is broad and sharpened on one side, fastened to a handle. Smaller slicers are also placed on the table to facilitate serving flat cakes, flawns and tarts that are difficult to lift with a spoon or a knife.  . An illustration of a Long Fork like Utensil, used for Slicing Fish. The Handle and The Front portion are Craved with Various Designs. . PARTRIDGES; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper les Perdreaux). There are various ways of carving partridges; when young, simply divide them in two length-wise; when large, either detach the hind part from the breast or divide each one in three on their length, that is, cut a part of the breast with the leg on, so to leave the upper breast adhere to a part of the carcass; then detach with a pair of carving scissors; this is demonstrated in the drawing. If the hind part is detached with the breast, then this should be divided into three parts and returned to their original position; in this manner it is difficult to perceive that the partridge has been cut, for it is given its natural form. Large partridges need simply cutting in four.  ,  ,  ,  . An illustration of Different parts of a Partridge with Various Angles. . PHEASANT AND GROUSE OR PRAIRIE CHICKEN; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper un Faisan une Grouse ou un Tétras). A pheasant can be carved the same way as a large chicken (  ), which means to cut it in five pieces, but should it be extra large two fillets can be taken from each side of the breast, leaving an upper or central part of the breast. The legs are generally dry and tough, yet should they have to be served, cut each one in two. Grouse or prairie chicken can be carved exactly the same. . ROAST BEEF; HOW TO CARVE RIBS (Pour Découper une Pièce de Côtes de Bœuf Rôti).  . An illustration of a Large Portion of Roast Beef placed on a Large Tray along with a Carving Knife. American roast beef is taken from the ribs; sometimes seven ribs are served, but the piece containing only six is far more advantageous, while the four rib piece, cut from the short loin is better still. Roast beef must be carved on the table, or else on the dining-room sideboard, for when cut beforehand it becomes dry and loses the best part of its juices. Roast beef is to be cut in thin slices, leaving a small piece of fat adhering to each one; at once place them on hot plates and be careful to baste with a little of the gravy flowing from the meat on to the dish. . TENDERLOIN OF BEEF; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper un Filet de Bœuf). Whether the tenderloin be roasted or braized, when cutting off slices for the guests, do not let them be too thick or too thin; remove half an inch of the sole from the tenderloin (  ) and cut the meat into even thin slices, crosswise if the tenderloin be large; if thin, have the slices cut on the bias, but do not penetrate through the sole piece; pare the bottom free of fat. Serve these slices on very hot plates with a little of its gravy, independent of the accompanying sauce or garnishing, which must be served separately.  . An illustrtion of a Tenderloin of Beef Ready to be Craved. . HOT HAM; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper un Jambon Chaud). Ham served hot is better when carved at the table, for it retains its essential juices. The most delicate part of a ham is the kernel, it being the fleshiest: this is to be cut in not too thick slices, leaving the fat adhering to the meat, then placed on hot plates; serve a good sauce separately in a sauceboat. When the ham is accompanied by a garnishing, it must also be served separately and offered to the guests. In order to have a ham prepared for handing round, it should first be cut up, then reconstructed the same as should a leg of mutton.  . An illustration of a Large piece of Ham ready to be Craved. . LEG OF MUTTON; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper un Gigot de Mouton). If the leg be roasted, carve it at the table or in the dining-room. It must be served on a dish without gravy, sauce or garnishing. Seize the end bone of the leg, having the kernel uppermost, for this is to be cut first, it being the fleshiest and the best part of the leg. The slices must be broad and thin, to be served on very hot plates, each one accompanied by a little of the good gravy flowing from the meat. Should the leg have a garnishing this must be served apart.  . An illustration of a Leg of Mutton with Carving Lines shown. Lamb is carved the same way. The bone end of the leg to be trimmed with a specially made handle, or else a fancy favor frill. When the leg is to be presented at the table, it should be previously carved and reconstructed to its original shape. . SADDLE OF MUTTON, SADDLE OF LAMB, AND SADDLE OF VENISON, ROASTED; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper une Selle de Mouton, d'Agneau, et de Chevreuil Rôti). The dish containing these roasts must be placed on the table before the person who is to carve; the loin end to be turned to the left, for from this end is the saddle begun. There are two ways of carving the roasted saddle; the first way is to cut the slices on the length of the meat, slightly bias; see braized saddle,  . They to be neither too long nor too thin. For the second way, the slices are cut the entire length of the meat, but in every case serve on very hot plates, adding a little of the good gravy from the meat and serving another gravy separetly in a sauceboat. . BRAIZED SADDLE OF MUTTON; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper une Selle de Mouton Braisée). To have a braized saddle of mutton carved on the table, it should be placed on a hot dish without any gravy or garnishing; first make two incisions, one on each side, just between the fat of the flank or the kernel, then cut the large fillets across in rather thick slices; avoid having too much fat on any of them. A saddle of mutton can be carved in the kitchen without deteriorating from its good qualities; in this case, remove the fillets entirely, pare free of all fat and cut them across in half inch thick slices; return them to their original position, and when serving, hand around at the same time, both garnishing and a sauceboatful of gravy or sauce.  . An illustration of a Braised Saddle of Mutton with Craving lines shown on one part of the Meat. . LOIN AND KERNEL OF VEAL; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper une Longe ou une Noix de Veau). Before carving a loin of veal, first detach the tenderloin and kidney; cut the loin into cross-wise slices, not too thin, and place each one on a hot plate, adding a slice of the kidney or minion fillet, also a little good gravy or any sauce accompanying this remove, only serving it separately. On   will be found a larded kernel of veal, served as an entrée on a round dish. In order to cut the kernel, it requires to be held firmly by the fork on the udder side, enabling the larded meat to be cut in not too thick slices. Serve on hot plates with a little gravy, independent of the sauce or garnishing that accompanies it. . GOOSE OR DUCK; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper une Oie ou un Canard). Geese and ducks are carved the same as other poultry; when young, their legs can be served, but if large and older it were better to leave them undetached on the carcass. To carve a goose with ease, the breast must be turned toward the carver, as shown in  . The meats of each side of the breast are to be cut in not too thin fillets and immediately placed on hot plates, then basted over with a little good gravy. When the geese are stuffed, add to each plateful a small piece of the dressing. If serving the legs of a young goose or duck it is obligatory, first to detach them from the carcass and divide in medium-sized pieces with the carving scissors. Large tame ducks are carved the same as geese, and young ducklings can be separated in four parts. The breast alone of wild ducks is used, lifting one fillet from off each side or both fillets may be divided lengthwise in two; serve these on a little good gravy taken from the carcasses, after breaking them up and pressing out all the juice; heat this gravy slightly with lemon juice, salt, mignonette and finely chopped blanched shallot.  . An illustration of a Goose with craving Lines drawn on it. . PIGEONS; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper des Pigeons). Young pigeons are served whole or simply cut lengthwise in two; when very large, separate the hind part from the breast part and make two pieces of each of these. . A PULLET OR CAPON; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper une Poularde ou un Chapon). A large piece of poultry that requires to be carved at table, calls for the greatest care in order to have all the pieces neat, even and of a proper size, neither too large nor too small. A pair of carving scissors will be found indispensable. To proceed with ease have the pieces laid on a dish in front of the carver; should the pinions be left on the wings, cut them off with the scissors, then cut from the breast one small slice, taking the minion fillet along; from the remainder of the breast cut another pretty slice through the entire length. If the breast of the chicken be very large cut from it another slice without encroaching on the top part of the breast; after one side is finished cut the other without changing its position and as soon as the fillets are all removed, detach the thighs from the carcass by disjointing them, but first cut away the skin from the carcass just where the thigh begins; in this way it can be lifted off with a fork assisting with the blade of a knife. As soon as one thigh is detached, separate the leg at the knee bone with the scissors and divide the thigh in two, either across or on the length.  ,  ,  . An illustraion of a Pullet from Different angles. Shown with Carving Lines. The carcass can also be divided transversely in two or three pieces. The whole operation must be dexterous and speedy as all eyes are apt to be watching the carver, therefore he must not hesitate, but proceed bravely to the end. When a medium-sized fowl is to be carved, it can first be divided into four parts, detaching the legs from the carcass, then the breasts without making any upper breast. With these four parts eight pieces can be secured, two from each leg and two from each breast, cutting these on their length according to the lines marked in the figures. . ROAST TURKEY; HOW TO CARVE (Pour Découper une Dinde Rôtie). To be able to carve a turkey at table it requires a certain amount of self-possession, for they are frequently very fat, and, therefore, more difficult to manipulate than a pullet. Unless it cannot be avoided, the legs of a roast turkey should not be detached, serving only the breast part; this is done in two distinct ways: the first consists of cutting the breast pieces in crosswise slices slightly on the bias as shown in the figure; the second by cutting the fillets lengthwise from the breasts without having any upper breast part; in either case it is proper before beginning to detach the wings from both sides with a part of the breast adhering. When the thighs are wanted, detach them one after the other; clip off the drum sticks at the knee joint and then divide the second joint meats in pieces, leaving the drum stick whole. The gravy that is to be served with a roast turkey should always be in a separate sauceboat.  . An illustration of a Large Roast Turkey, shown with Carving Lins. . CHOPPED PARSLEY, TRUFFLES, ONIONS, SHALLOTS, MUSHROOMS, TONGUE AND CORAL (Pour Hacher le Persil, les Truffes, les Oignons, les Échalotes, les Champignons, la Langue et le Corail).

For Onions. -Cut them in two, suppress the end stalk, and slice them perpendicularly, then cut them horizontally into squares more or less large; they may afterward be chopped up so as to loosen them, and have them finer; wash them in cold water, drain on a cloth to extract all the liquid; proceed the same for shallots, without cutting them in two and put them on a plate in a cool place. For Mushrooms. -If they are already cooked, drain them well, slice, then chop them up; if raw, peel off the skin, wash them nicely, cut in squares, then chop; use them immediately. For Red Beef Tongue. -Use only the thin end of the tongue, slice, chop and lay it on a tin sheet covered with a sheet of paper, expose them to a draught to dry, chop once more until very fine, then pass them through a sieve, and keep in a cool place till needed. For Lobster Coral. -Take out the red part found inside of a boiled lobster, wash it nicely, changing the water frequently, dry it in the air, then chop it up very fine to pass through a sieve (  ); spread it on a tin sheet over a sheet of paper, dry it in the air, and keep it for use in a cool place. . TO COAT JELLY MOLDS AND MOLD JELLIES (Pour Chemiser les Moules à Gelée et Mouler les Gelées). If the mold need be only lightly coated, it is sufficient just to cool it on ice, then pour into it the cold liquid jelly and move it around so that it reaches all the sides; put the mold back on to the ice, and begin the operation again a quarter of an hour later, but should the coating of jelly be required thick, then glue over the top of the mold a heavy paper, and when the gum is dry, cut a ring in the surface of the paper with the tip of a small knife, leaving all around a margin a quarter of an inch, then pour some jelly into the mold, and turn it round on the ice inclining it in such a way that the coat acquires the necessary thickness on all its sides.  . An illustration of a Round Jelly Mold filled wuth Nuts. To Mold Jellies. -Put some ice into a small vessel, add its equal quantity of water, and set it in a cylindrical fancy mold: fill this up with some cold liquid jelly, lay on top and half an inch higher than the mold a tin sheet or plate, cover this with broken ice without any salt and after the jelly is thoroughly cold and firm, unmold it. In order to accomplish this, dip the mold quickly into hot water at one hundred and fifteen to one hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit; wipe it briskly and overturn it on to a cold dish as soon as the jelly detaches, and then remove the mold. . TO PREPARE COCOANUT (Préparation de la Noix de Coco). Break a cocoanut across in two, exactly in the center; slip the blade of a thin round-tipped knife between the nut and the shell, push it in with the right hand and turn the cocoa with the left; detach and take out the entire half nut; remove the outer skin covering the nut with a vegetable knife (  ), and when it is all peeled, throw the nut into cold water; drain and scrape it on a coarse grater. Use a part of it for roasting by putting the grated nut on a sheet of paper into a moderate oven and keep the remainder into a stone jar in the ice-box mixing it with an equal weight of sugar. . VEGETABLE COLORS (Couleurs Végétales). Spinach green is frequently used for coloring purées, soups, butters, sauces and sugar. It is the healthiest coloring matter, and if possible use no other. Spinach green is prepared with very green, fresh spinach, well washed, pounded in a mortar and when well reduced to a paste, extract all the juice through a coarse cloth, and place this in an untinned copper sugar pan, and heat it till it decomposes, then pour it over a fine sieve so the pulp or coloring matter remains on top; the strained liquid is colorless and useless. For yellow, use a decoction of saffron or dandelion flowers; for red, employed for coloring bisques, orchanet dissolved in butter is used. The roucou annotto also gives a yellowish red and is much used. Vegetable colors, and clarified carmine,Breton Landrin, are those mostly employed. Breton Landrin green is beautiful for coloring sugars cooked to crack, as it is not detrimental to its transparency. Colorings: Carmine and Cochineal Red. -Take two ounces of No. 42 carmine, broken in pieces; wet with a little cold water; crush in a small mortar and dilute with a little twenty-five degree syrup. Besides this, boil two quarts of syrup also to twenty-five degrees, mix in the carmine, boil up once, strain through a napkin and leave to cool, then add a few coffeespoonfuls of liquid ammonia and pour into bottles.

From the bones and heads of bass, sheepshead, blackfish, etc., the best fish stock is obtained. Cook a mirepoix composed of sliced roots, shallots and onions, add to it the fragments of fish as explained above and cook these together for a few moments on a good fire; moisten with two or three gills of white wine and let it fall to a glaze over a brisk fire; moisten it again at once with two gills of fish broth and also let this fall to a glaze, then remoisten to their height with good fish broth and a little white wine, add a bunch of aromatic herbs, a bunch of parsley, and some fresh mushroom peelings, boil the liquid while skimming and set it on one side of the range to despumate for a quarter of an hour, skimming it carefully. Strain the stock through a sieve, let it settle, and pour off the top into a glazed vessel, and if it be not succulent enough, then reduce it again; keep it in a cool place. This stock may be easily kept from one day to another, if care be taken to keep the vessel and its contents incrusted on ice. This court bouillon may also be moistened with red wine; in either case, it must be prepared with the greatest care possible. . ALMOND CREAM (Crème d'Amandes).

Cut the croûtons from the crumb of a stale loaf of bread; for entrées cut them half heart -shaped, three inches long by two and a half wide, and a quarter of an inch thick (see  .); fry them in butter, and as soon as one side is browned, turn them over, and repeat until they have attained a fine color on both sides. FIG.40. An illustration of a Piece of Bread Cut in a Triangular Shape. For Vegetables, Scrambled Eggs, Spinach, Chiccory, etc. -Cut them triangle shaped, one and a quarter inches on the sides, by one quarter of an inch thick; fry them in butter, browning them nicely on both sides. For Soups. -Serve croûtons three-sixteenths to four-sixteenths square or round shaped, three quarters of an inch in diameter, by one-eighth in thickness; either of these must be fried a fine color in butter, but do not allow them to get too dry. In order to obtain fine croûtons, they must be fried in clarified butter, lard or oil, and in a sautoir, but not in the frying fat.  . An illustration of a Crust of an Oblong Shape. For Roast Game, Pheasants, Partridges, Grouse and Quail, have oblong shaped croûtons; trim the edges and then cut off a quarter of an inch of the four corners; pass the knife all around the croûtons a quarter of an inch from the edge, fry and cut away the centers, scoop out the crumb from this space, and lay them under the game; reed-birds or larks must be laid on oblong croûtons sufficiently long to hold two or more birds, but do not scoop these out. For Snipe, Woodcock or Plovers, have wider, oblong crusts (  ); dig out the crumb in the center to hold the bird and scoop out smaller hollows on each side, which should be garnished with a forcemeat, made of chopped up chicken livers and shallots, fried in scraped lard; mix some fine herbs with the livers. Epicures sometimes have the chopped intestines added to the forcemeat. . TO PREPARE HOLLOW CRUSTS (Pour Préparer les Croûtes Creuses). Hollowed out crusts are used for serving small garnishings composed of purées, game fillets, and also boned small birds, such as larks and reed-birds; they are also employed to serve with poached eggs, after filling the hollow space with some garnishing. Hollow crusts are made of bread crumb, timbale paste or puff paste.  ,  ,  ,  a. An illustration of Different Molds to Make Hollow Crusts. Bread Crumb Crusts are cut oval and half heart shaped ( Figs. 42 and 43); they are two inches long and three quarters of an inch thick; make incisions on one side near the edge, using for this a small knife; brown both sides in a sautoir with clarified butter, then drain them to open and scoop out the crumb. Crusts made of Timbale Paste are formed from an oval layer of paste, three-sixteenths of an inch thick; they are shaped in unbuttered tin rings, half an inch high, either oval or round, plain or channelled ( Figs. 44 and 45); the paste is cut flush with the top of the ring, the ring is now removed and the outside edge of the paste is pinched prettily, the top also to form the crest; let dry for a few minutes; they are now to be placed in larger buttered rings, or surrounded with bands of buttered paper to support the paste while cooking; line the inside with buttered paper and fill with raw rice; cook in a moderate oven; when done remove from the rings, empty out the rice, brush the crusts with an egg -wash and put in the oven to color nicely.  . An illustration of Different Molds used in Making a Hollow Crust. To Make puff paste Crusts Plain or with Fluted Cutter. -Cut the paste round or oval shaped in any desired size, arrange them on a moist baking sheet, a short distance apart, and prick them; moisten the edges with a brush and apply around this a band of the same paste three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness by five-sixteenths of an inch in width; fasten the ends of the band together, egg the surface and bake these crusts in a moderate oven the same as small bouchées. . EGGING AND MOISTENING (Darer et Mouiller). Egging With Whole Eggs. -Beat the eggs with half as much water and run them through a sieve. Egg-yolks Alone. -Stir the yolks with the same volume of water and strain. With Milk. -Mix as much milk as yolks, beat well together and strain. Moistening. -Moisten lightly with water, baking sheets or else flats of paste on which another is to be laid in order to fasten the two together. For both egging and moistening use a feather or very soft hair brush (  ). . TO BEAT UP THE WHITE OF EGGS (Pour Fouetter les Blancs d'Œufs). Although the eggs intended for beating up the white should be perfectly fresh, still they must not be newly laid, for when these are used they are liable to become a greenish color, while baking. Procure an egg -beater or a whip made for this purpose, and a small untinned basin, separate most carefully the yolks from the whites, and put these into the basin with a very little salt, then begin to whip, slowly at the beginning but proceed gradually to increase the velocity of the motion as the volume increases so as to allow them to absorb all the air possible, which gives them their consistency. Should the whites threaten to turn, they must be whipped again until smooth, adding to them a handful of powdered sugar or a few drops of citric acid.  . An illustration of a Tin Basin and an Egg Whisk. . FAT PREPARED FOR FRYING (Graisse Préparée Pour la Friture). The preference is generally given to beef kidney suet; cut it in half inch pieces and place these in an untinned iron pan with one gill of water for every pound of fat; cook on a slow fire stirring carefully from time to time so that it cannot adhere to the bottom. When very clear and it ceases to froth it is a sign that it is done, then strain through a sieve or cloth. . FAT FOR SOCLES AND FLOWERS (Graisse Pour Socles et pour les Fleurs). Fat for Socles. -Remove the skin and all the membranes from twenty pounds of mutton kidney suet, cut it up in half inch squares, and put this grease into twenty-five quarts of cold water with one pound of carbonate of soda, wash well the fat, change the water frequently, drain, then melt it on a slow fire, being careful to stir it so that it does not adhere to the bottom of the pan, nor brown in the slightest, add to it eight ounces of Siam benzoin and as soon as it is thoroughly rendered out, mix in the same quantity of lard, strain through a fine towel, and put it aside to cool slightly; then add a little ultra-marine blue. Stir with a whisk until cool, and having body enough to be worked: fasten a mandrel on a round or oval board, begin working at the bottom of the foundation with a profile, previously soaked in cold water and kept wet, and when the base is very firm, continue coating the mandrel with the fat, and profiling it until the whole socle is finished. Decorate with natural or grease flowers as below forming a wreath around the top of the mandrel, or if preferred festoon it, leaving a few inches of the decoration fall in scallops gracefully around. To Make Grease Flowers. -Have half as much fat prepared for socles as virgin wax, melting both together; color them in various colors while the fat is still hot and place in vessels keeping each color separate; have for instance: white, pink, red, green, brown, etc., let cool. Twelve hours later unmold the fat on to a wet napkin and scrape into fine shavings with a strong knife, then gather all of these in a damp cloth so as to soften and have it get smooth by kneading it till it becomes ductile as clay; roll into small balls and place these between two wet cloths; rub the top of each ball with a piece of smooth ice until it is very thin so that it resembles the petal of a real flower for example, to make a rose arrange some pink fat around a small stick to imitate the center of the flower, fasten on the petals all around as quickly as they are prepared and when there are sufficient, pull out the stick and begin another until enough flowers are obtained. Fasten them on to the upper border of a socle. This same grease can be used for modeling. . TO SCALE AND CLEAN FISH; TO SKIN EELS (Pour Écailler le Poisson, le Nettoyer et Dépouiller les Anguilles). For English Soles. -Remove the black skin, starting at the tail with a knife, then pulling it off. If trout be required for boiling, they must be cooked with the scales on. German carp should not be scaled. For Salmon, Turbot, Bass or Mullets. -Scrape the outside with a strong knife in order to remove the scales. All fish must be emptied either by the gills or by an opening made in the belly; cut away the fins with a pair of strong scissors. To Skin Eels. -They must be hung up by the head on a hook, remove a little piece of the skin all around below the fins so as to be able to catch hold of it, then grasp it with a cloth, and pull it down the whole length of the body, turning it inside out.

Forcemeats are indispensable for performing fine work and are liked by good livers; they are principally used for hors-d'œuvre, garnishings, removes and entrées; for stuffing breasts or shoulders of veal, poultry, game and fish. They are also necessary to form borders, for holding the garnishing and for large timbales; they must always be prepared in advance with the very freshest meats, otherwise they are likely to be of little good and liable to spoil, this being of the greatest importance to observe, and be sure to keep them on ice until needed. Always be careful when composing a menu, not to have too many dishes containing forcemeats, for they will detract from the simplicity and natural plainness of a dinner. . TO PREPARE AND MAKE FORCEMEATS AND TO RECTIFY THEM (Pour Préparer et Faire les Farces et les Rectifier).  . An illustration of a Machine to Remove Nerves.  . An illustration of a Round Shaped Metal Sieve. Chicken. -Use only the lean and well pared meats of poultry or game, some panada, fresh butter, or cooked and cold veal udder, raw egg-yolks or else the whites, or sometimes whole eggs, salt and spices, also cold sauces or else raw cream. Pass the meat once or twice through a machine to remove the nerves (  ); afterward pound it to a pulp so it can readily pass through a metal sieve fitting on to the mortar (  ); pound the meat once more, then add the panada, the butter or udder, continuing to pound all the time, and then add the eggs singly without ceasing to pound and the seasonings; pass through a strong hair sieve. Put this into a thin tin vessel, set it on ice and stir for a few moments with a spoon in order to have it perfectly smooth, keep in a cool place until needed. Game. -To make game quenelle forcemeat, proceed the same as for the chicken; to have it delicate, use brown sauce or melted meat glaze, and pass the meat once more after all the ingredients are mixed in. For this it requires a strong hair sieve, or one of fine tinned wire; stand this sieve on a round dish, slightly larger than itself, so it can receive the forcemeat as it falls through; put only a small quantity on the sieve at the time; press it forcibly with a large wooden spoon to have it pass through rapidly, and when all is finished, place it in a tin vessel and stir it for a few moments with a spoon to render it smooth and keep it in a cool place until needed. To Rectify Forcemeats. -Try a little piece, formed into a half inch ball, in boiling water or in the oven, and if too consistent add some cream or velonté, for white forcemeats, and espagnole or melted glaze for brown game. If too weak, a little pounded panada is to be added, mixing it in gradually with some egg-yolks, whites or whole eggs.  .

After a short time a scum will form on the surface; this must in no ways be disturbed until the gherkins are needed, for it acts as a protector, preventing any air from penetrating into the liquid. When the gherkins are wanted for use, take them from the brine; unsalt by putting them in fresh water for twelve hours. Pour half water and half vinegar in an untinned copper basin, throw into it a small bagful of spices, such as cloves, peppers, mustard seeds and mace. Place on the fire and at the first boil, plunge in the well drained gherkins and leave to bubble for a few moments, then remove the basin from the fire and put both gherkins and vinegar into a large jar or barrel to cool off; put in with them a handful of tarragon, some small blanched onions and shallots and a few red peppers; stand this in a well aired place for a few days and the gherkins will be then ready for use. . GRATED PARMESAN AND SWISS CHEESE (Fromage de Parmesan et Gruyère râpé). Cut off all the rind from the cheese, leaving no black part on whatever; grate by rubbing the cheese against a sufficiently coarse grater (  ) until it is all consumed; keep in a cool but not too damp place. . GRATED HORSERADISH AND HORSERADISH RIBBONS (Raifort Râpé et en Rubans). Grated horseradish should be made of clean, fresh horseradish root, peeled or scraped, washed and dried, then rubbed against a large grater; it can either be served fresh or put into a stone jar with salt and vinegar, corking it well to preserve till needed. For horseradish ribbons, peel the root the same as for grating, and scrape it with the sharp blade of a knife, held at an angle from the top to the bottom; by this method fine ribbons of the root are obtained; let them be as long as it is possible to have them. Long horseradish should be used for this purpose. . COOKED CHOCOLATE ICING (Glace Cuite au Chocolat). Put into a sugar -pan a quarter of a pound of unsweetened chocolate; let it soften at the oven door, and dilute it with two gills of warm syrup at sixteen degrees, or simply with water, then add to the liquid some icing sugar, so as to obtain a smooth preparation neither too soft nor too thin. . COOKED COCOA ICING (Glace Cuite au Cacao). Dissolve a quarter of a pound of cocoa or unsweetened chocolate, in a sugar -pan; cook three quarters of a pound of sugar in another pan with one pint of water till it reaches the degree of small thread, mash the cocoa with a spoon, dilute it gradually with the cooked sugar, then cook all together until it reaches small thread again; remove it from the fire, rub it against the sides of the pan with a spoon in order to mass it well; this icing is used to ice Génoese, éclairs and a variety of small cakes. . ROYAL ICING, AND ROYAL ICING FLAVORED WITH ZESTS (Glace Royale et Glace Royale Parfumée aux Zestes.) Royal Icing. -Put into a vessel the whites of one or several eggs (those not too fresh are preferable), and add to them some icing sugar, sifted through a very fine sieve, sufficient to have the eggs and sugar combined; form into a running paste, add several drops, either of lemon juice or acetic acid, according to the quantity of icing. With a wooden spatula beat up slowly to begin, then continue the action more briskly, always turning it in such a way that the air may enter, which helps to make the icing lighter and firmer. Beat it until the spoon, being lifted from the icing, it stands on it upright, without falling off. This royal icing is excellent for decorating pieces, cakes, etc., but for flowers or decorations to be made entirely of royal icing, then after beating, add more icing sugar, but do not get it too hard. Royal icing can be made any color by using vegetable colors. Royal Icing flavored with Zests. -Put into a basin, half a pound of sugar, add a few spoonfuls of sugar flavored either with orange or lemon zest, adding gradually sufficient white of egg to allow it to flow; this icing is used for covering cakes. . ICING WITH SYRUP FOR CAKES FLAVORED WITH VANILLA, ORANGE, LEMON OR FRUIT JUICES (Glace au Sirop pour Gâteaux Perfumée soit à la Vanille, à l'Orange, au Citron ou au Jus de Fruits). Put one pint of water and a pound of sugar in a saucepan, adding half a vanilla bean or else some orange or lemon peel; stand it on the fire, let boil up a few times to obtain a syrup, then remove the saucepan from the range immediately, suppress the vanilla or peels and incorporate sufficient sugar to form a very smooth flowing paste. For Uncooked Fruit Juice Icing. -Prepare it with strawberry, raspberry, currant or pineapple juice. Simply crush the ripe, fresh fruits, pour them on a sieve to collect all the liquid. Put some icing sugar in a vessel, dissolve it with a little thirty-degree syrup, and the fruit juice, incorporating the liquid slowly; just before using this icing warm it in an untinned copper vessel, stirring it during the operation. The icing sugars are colored according to taste and are used for icing Genoeses, pouring it over or else dipping in all kinds of small cakes, such as éclairs, etc. . TO PREPARE, CLARIFY AND FILTER ASPIC JELLY (Pour Préparer la Gelée d'Aspic, la Clarifier et la Filtrer). Aspic or meat jelly is prepared with chicken or game broth, obtaining it as clear as possible, and mixing it with a certain quantity of gelatine made either with calf 's feet or pig skin, or even with isinglass. Aspics are also prepared with special stocks made under the following conditions: brown in a saucepan half a pound of breast of veal, one knuckle, and two fowls, suppressing the breasts; when the meats are lightly colored moisten them amply with some light broth, free of all fat, and add to it four or five boned and blanched calf 's feet, also some roots and onions, a garnished bouquet, but no salt, boil the liquid while skimming, remove it to the side of the range, and finish cooking the meats, lifting them out as soon as they are done. Strain the liquid through a sieve, skim off all the fat, try a little of it on ice to judge of its consistency, and should it not be sufficiently firm, then heat it up once more, and stir into it a few gelatine leaves softened in cold water and dissolved in a small separate saucepan. The aspic should never be reduced with the idea of rendering it firmer, because the boiling only wastes it without thickening it; chop one pound of lean beef, one pound for two quarts of liquid, add to it four egg-whites or two whole eggs and one pint of white wine, dilute it gradually with the aspic jelly, put it into a saucepan on the fire, stir the liquid with a whisk until the instant boiling point is reached, then remove it to one side, and let it simmer very slowly, till it becomes perfectly clear, then strain it through a flannel bag (  ); or moisten a clean napkin and arrange it on a kitchen filtering stool as shown in  ; should the jelly not be sufficiently limpid, pour it through again until perfectly clear.  ,  . An illustration of a flannel bag being upheld by a ring to left of text,  , and a napkin on a kitchen filtering stool,  . . CALF'S FOOT JELLY WITH MADEIRA WINE (Gelée de Pieds de Veau au vin de Madère). Take the value of one quart of calf 's foot gelatine and mix into it three quarters of a pound of sugar and the juice of four lemons. After the sugar is dissolved try its consistency to rectify it if necessary, adding more water or more gelatine according to whether it be too soft or too hard. Beat up four egg-whites without letting them come to a froth, mix in a gill of cold water and pour this over the dissolved gelatine; set the untinned basin on a moderate fire, whip the liquid slowly until on the verge of boiling, then withdraw it to a slower heat and keep the liquid simmering without boiling; now add the juice of four lemons; cover and leave stand for thirty minutes. The jelly should now be limpid; filter it through a flannel bag or a napkin fastened to the four feet of a filtering stool (  ), return the jelly to the bag and continue the operation until it passes through clearly; this should be done in a warm place. As soon as the jelly is properly filtered let it stand until cold and then add one gill of good Madeira, pour it into a mold previously imbedded in ice and leave it for one hour and a half to set. . MEAT JELLY WITH GELATINE (Gelée de Viande à la Gélatine). Put four quarts of good broth with one pound of gelatine into a saucepan, adding a quarter of an ounce of pepper-corns , two cloves, a few branches of celery and a little mace, put it on to the fire and stir continuously with a whip until the liquid boils; season to taste. Break six eggs, put them with their shells into a bowl and beat them up a little mixing in with them, half a bottle of white wine or a quarter of a bottle of Madeira, one gill of tarragon vinegar, and a quart of small pieces of clean ice, dilute this with a quart of the liquid jelly, and pour the clarification into the remainder of the jelly, stirring it constantly, then return the saucepan to the fire and continue the beating. When the jelly has reached the boiling degree, remove it from the fire, and keep it very warm for half an hour, but it must not boil again; filter as indicated . . SWEET JELLY WITH GELATINE, OR FISH ISINGLASS (Gelé Douce à la Gélatine ou à la Colle de Poisson). Put into a basin four quarts of water, three pounds of sugar, half a pound of gelatine or ten ounces of fish isinglass and the peel of eight lemons, stir the whole well together until the sugar is melted, then set the basin on a slow fire and beat well with a whip; as soon as it begins to boil put in twelve partly beaten egg-whites into which has been added the juice of twelve lemons; mix the whole well together stirring unceasingly and allowing it to boil slowly from fifteen to twenty minutes, then withdraw the basin from the fire and let the jelly rest for a few moments; now pour it through a flannel bag upheld by a ring (  ); return it several times until it acquires a perfect limpidity. The lemon-peel can be suppressed, flavoring it with any kind of liquor or clarified fruit juice. . LARD (Saindoux). Lard is the produce of leaf lard melted with fat pork; this operation should be performed rapidly, especially in summer time. Remove the membranes and sanguineous parts from all that is required for making the lard -say about twenty pounds; cut the leaf lard and fat pork into half inch squares and steep them separately for two hours in an abundance of cold water using twelve quarts for each and two ounces of crystal soda also for each; wash both in several waters, keeping them separated; drain and lay first the fat pork in a saucepan with four quarts of water, melt it on a slow fire being careful to stir the bottom frequently; as it melts it becomes white and milky, then transparent, when in this state, strain it through a colander and return it to a clean saucepan adding the leaf lard; set it on a good fire and stir incessantly until the squares become dry and brown, then strain the fat, press well the squares, leave to cool slightly, afterward adding a gill of water for every two pounds of the fat. Beat the whole vigorously, let cool and draw off the clear part before the fat has had time to congeal, just when it begins to set, beat thoroughly to have it smooth. . OXONGE-LARD (Oxonge-Saindoux). Oxonge is exclusively obtained by melting leaf lard without using any other material; oxonge is finer than lard and is also employed for kitchen and pastry purposes. The leaf lard is melted in a bain-marie or by steam, this latter method being preferable. Remove the skin and fibers from ten pounds of leaf lard, cut it up in squares about half an inch each and bathe them in eighteen quarts of water with half a pound of crystal soda; wash in several waters, drain and pound in a mortar, then put it into a well tinned copper basin in a bain-marie and steam by keeping the water boiling all the time until the lard is all melted, now strain it through a fine colander and leave to cool slightly, adding one pint of cold water, stir well, let it rest, then pour off the clear part when it begins to set, beat well to have it smooth. . VEAL UDDER. (Tétine de Veau). Veal Udder is the fatty part covering a kernel of veal; remove it entirely, tie it up and cook in plenty of white broth; when done take it out, pull off the string and press it lightly under a weight. Pare and cut it either into strips, squares or bands, etc. It is used in forcemeats instead of butter, pass it twice through the machine, pound well and then pass through a sieve. The way to keep it is to leave it covered in a cool place or else cover over entirely with salt. . TO PREPARE LARDING PORK (Pour Préparer le Lard à Piquer). Lift the bands of pork leaving as little meat on as possible, from the first rib to the end of the loin; lay them in brine for three months, then drain off, and put them on a table to rub one by one and cover with salt. Set them one on top of the other in a cool, dry place and range a board over with a weight on top; turn them over, and throw on some salt, and at the end of a month change those from the bottom to the top, and three months after, fasten a strong twine to each piece, and hang them up separately in a cold, dark room to dry. Another Way. -The piece of pork taken from the back is the only one to use for larding purposes, as it is firm and not liable to crack. Remove all the meat from it, and cut it into an oblong piece, this being called a band; salt it dry with fine salt for three or four weeks, and if it be necessary to use it shortly after its salting, then rub it with very fine salt, and hang it up in a dry and cool place. This pork must be salted toward the end of the winter; fat pork never receives more salt than it needs, whichever way it may be employed, or however long the operation may last. . TO CUT FAT PORK FOR LARDING (Manière de Tailler le Lard Pour Piquer). The larding pork must be white and firm, perfectly dry and cooled on ice, specially in summer so to make it harder and to be enabled to cut it more evenly. Divide the pork into the required length leaving on the rind; remove a slice from the top of the necessary thickness to have the pork of the same thickness throughout, paring the two ends square, then divide it into lardons at equal distances cutting them perpendicularly as far down as the rind, for this use a thin knife, called a lard slicer, and cut the lard the size designated by  , then cut them horizontally to obtain very square lardons of the desired size.  .  . - Larding Needle for Beef â la Mode.  . - Trussing Needle.  . - Large Larding Needle. An illustration of Different Kinds of Needles used for Larding Purposes. No. 1, lardons as represented in the figure are from three to four-eighths of an inch square, by three and one-quarter to four inches long. This size is for larding beef à la mode, braised tongue, kernel of veal, leg of mutton, etc. No. 2, are three-sixteenths of an inch square by two and one quarter inches long; this size is convenient for saddles of venison, fricandeaux, tenderloins of beef, etc. No. 3, these are five-thirty-seconds of an inch square, by two inches in length; this size is for poultry, large game, fish, sweetbreads, veal cutlets, etc. No. 4, lardons of one-eighth of an inch square, by one and three-quarter inches long; this size is for small game, pigeons, chickens, etc. The lardons as shown in the figures are represented one quarter their actual size. . TO LARD MEAT, POULTRY AND GAME (Pour Piquer les Viandes la Volaille et le Gibier). If it be butcher's meat, pare it properly by removing in strips the skin covering the meat, then all the superfluous fat. The way to lard a tenderloin, is to pare a fine tenderloin of beef, weighing six pounds after it is trimmed; remove the fat, slide the blade of a thin knife between the skin and the meat, and press it on the skin so as to avoid injuring the flesh; remove also the superfluous fat on the side, then cut the two ends round shaped. Choose a larding needle of suitable size to hold the larding pork that should be cut into pieces of three-sixteenths by two and a quarter inches long; lay the tenderloin lengthwise on a heavy towel, place this over the left arm, then proceed to lard the meat with the larding needle threaded with a piece of the pork, boring the meat from right to left. The needle containing the pork must be stuck in the flesh to a depth depending upon its length, but the needle must be withdrawn with one stroke, so that the pork remains in the meat visible of an equal length on both sides. After the first row is larded, the next one should be slipped exactly between those of the first row; then instead of larding between the two lards of the last row, begin the operation from the start, which means lard two more rows the same as the first, observing that the second ones are arranged contrarywise to the first two, then continue until the whole tenderloin is filled. Proceed exactly the same for fricandeau, racks of veal, grenadins or sweetbreads.  ,  ,  ,  . An illustration of the Larding Process of Different Kinds of Meats. When a piece of poultry or game is required to be larded, it must first be drawn, singed and trussed, then singe the breast once more, or else dip this part into boiling water to harden the meat; after this is cold, lard with lardons adapted to their size. This in fact is the whole theory of larding, and by examining various larded pieces, one can easily become an adept in the art. . LEMONS; TO CUT THEM IN VARIOUS MANNERS (Citrons Taillés de Différentes Manières). First wash and wipe the lemons, then cut them lengthwise in four, to serve either with oysters or fried fish. Channeled slices of lemon are made by cutting small notches on the lemon lengthways of the peel, then cutting the lemon in crosswise slices an eighth of an inch thick. These are used for garnishing broiled fish. Slices of lemon cut the same way without being channeled, are frequently served with tea.  ,  . An illustration of Two Lemons Cut in Fancy Shapes. Halved lemons are prepared by paring off the two ends and then make sixteen notches in the center, the third of the length of the lemon with the tip of a small knife; these gashes should be very regular; run the knife through as far as the center, having eight cuts to the right and eight to the left, this makes eight long triangles; detach the lemon in two parts (  ). These are used also for cold fish and hâtelets or skewers (  ). Shells of lemon can also be made, making two shells from one lemon. Cut from the center of the lemon, beginning at the stalk, as far as the middle of one side and from the other end of the lemon as far as the middle of the other side, about one half inch of the peel, without detaching it; cut across the lemon, keeping the ribbon of the peel intact, thus producing two identical pieces; these halved shells are used for garnishing fried fishes such as sole à la Colbert, etc. . COOKED MARINADE (Marinade Cuite). Mince one pound of carrots, as many onions and half a pound of celery root; fry all these vegetables in a quarter of a pound of lard without letting them attain color, and moisten with two quarts of vinegar and one quart of water or more according to the strength of the vinegar. Add an ounce of parsley leaves, three bayleaves and as much thyme, half an ounce of basil, garlic, cloves, a bit of mace, a tablespoonful of crushed whole peppers and the same quantity of allspice, and some salt. Boil the whole for half an hour, put it aside to get cold and use this marinade for marinating venison, mutton, hare, etc. . RAW MARINADE (Marinade Crue). There are two kinds of raw marinade; the first one is made of oil, minced onions, branches of parsley, thyme, bayleaf, slices of lemon, salt, mignonette, garlic and basil. The second one is made of two quarts of vinegar, four quarts of water, minced carrots and onions, bayleaf, a clove of garlic, thyme, basil, mace, whole peppers and sprigs of parsley. . HOW TO DRESS MERINGUES (Pour Dresser les Meringues). Prepare a meringue paste as in No. 140. Pour the preparation into a pocket furnished with a socket and push it into rounds on to white paper bands; dust them over with fine sugar and press down the middle lightly, so as to efface the tip, formed by the socket, then range these paper bands on top of some wet boards. Cook the meringues on these boards in a very slack oven, leaving them in for fifty minutes; they must be of a fine golden color and well-dried; after taking them from the oven, detach them carefully from the paper, and remove all the soft parts from the insides, using a teaspoon for this purpose, then lay them immediately on a raised edged tin sheet, one beside the other, the hollow part uppermost, and keep them in a warm heater for twelve hours.  . An illustration of Meringue Paste Placed on a Large Tray in the Form of Balls. . MINCE MEAT (Mince Meat). Suppress all fibers and skin from half a pound of beef kidney suet, chop it up very finely; have also chopped half a pound of cooked ox heart; seed and pick half a pound of Malaga raisins, half a pound of Smyrna raisins, half a pound of currants, chop up three ounces of citron, cut three ounces of candied orange peel into three-sixteenth of an inch squares, peel and chop finely two pounds of apples.

Mix all the ingredients together and put them into a stone crock leaving it in a cool place for at least fifteen days before using. . TO TURN, CHANNEL AND FLUTE MUSHROOMS (Pour Tourner et Canneler les Champignons). Choose the freshest mushrooms and those of equal size, cut off the stems, wipe well the heads, and take them one by one in the left hand, the hollow side underneath, then with the tip of a small pointed knife cut away the peel in regular rings without destroying the mushroom, and turn from right to left pressing all the time against the tip of the small knife; this must be done quickly and let us observe that it is not on the first trial that a mushroom can be properly turned, it takes practice to accomplish this properly. As quickly as each one is done, throw it into a saucepan containing cold, acidulated water, just sufficient to cover, then drain off the water, and cook the mushrooms for seven or eight minutes with the lid on, adding salt, butter and lemon juice, to keep them as white as possible. As for fluting mushrooms, this art is only learned after long experience. Mushroom fluting has become almost a profession, and the difficulties to be overcome can be better understood on examining those pretty mushroom heads so delicately carved, we see displayed by all preserve manufacturers. . TO STONE OLIVES (Pour Énucléer les Olives). If the olives are plump, large and contain small stones, these can be removed with a machine made for the purpose (  ) or with a tube from a column box, but generally the meat is cut off in spirals around the stone by means of a small knife. After the stone is removed, the olives resume their former shape, then plunge them into boiling water, and take them out again at once; they must be blanched without boiling.  . An illustration of a Machine Used in Pitting Olives with a Long Handle. . PANADA CREAM FRANGIPANE (Panade Crème Frangipane).

The Garnished Bouquet of Parsley. -Make it exactly the same as the plain bouquet the only difference being that it envelopes various aromatics, such as thyme, bayleaf, clove of garlic, basil, marjoram, chives, green celery, etc. When we speak of a garnished bunch of parsley without any specification, we mean garnished with a bayleaf and a small twig of thyme. Parsley in Branches for garnishing should be taken from well washed, very green parsley, from which the coarser stalks have been removed; keep it in fresh water and use when needed, draining it first: for garnishing fish, boiled beef, etc. Fried Parsley is used as an accessory to fried dishes; it is not a garnishing, but simply a decoration; detach some leaves from some very green parsley, wash them in cold water, drain, press them in the hand or in a cloth to extract all the water, and when dry, lay them in a wire basket to plunge into boiling fat; drain as soon as they stiffen. Chopped Parsley. -Choose very green parsley, wash, drain and press it so as to extract all the water, then cut it up as finely as possible, afterward chopping it well; wash it again, drain and squeeze it thoroughly to remove all the water; lay it on a cloth sieve and leave it in a cool place till needed. .

BABA PASTE (Pâte à Baba). Sift a pound of flour on the table, divide it in four even parts and use one of these to make the leaven by forming it in a circle and placing three quarters of an ounce of yeast in the center, diluting with a little warm milk to obtain a soft paste; roll this into a ball, cut it crosswise on the top with two cuts of the knife and lay it in a flour ed vessel; cover with a cloth and leave to rise in a mild temperature to double its size. Pile the remainder of the flour into a hillock, make a hole in the center to form a hollow and in it lay an ounce of sugar, a spare half ounce of salt (according to the saltness of the butter ), six ounces of butter and six eggs. Mix all the ingredients well together and work the flour in slowly, then begin to knead the paste so that it becomes smooth and acquires a body slowly adding three more eggs and four ounces of butter; continue to knead until again quite smooth with plenty of body, then mix in the leaven, wrapping it lightly in the paste and cutting the whole in every direction until thoroughly mingled and the paste is finished, then add to it two ounces of seeded Malaga raisins, two ounces of Sultana or Smyrna currants softened in water, two ounces of cherries cut in four and two ounces of finely cut up citron.

Sift the remainder of the flour on the table, form a hollow and put in the center, the salt, sugar, brandy, two spoonfuls of water, three of the eggs and the butter; mix together thoroughly with the hand, and incorporate gradually the flour so as to obtain a smooth paste, then beat sharply with the hands for a quarter of an hour, adding the rest of the eggs one at the time. Beat it well against the table to let it acquire a body; then lay out the paste and spread the yeast over, fold it up to enclose the yeast and break it into small pieces with the hands; pile up the broken pieces, cut the paste once more, and put the pieces as quickly as they are cut into a flour ed vessel, cover it and set it to rise in a moderate temperature, until it will be raised to twice its original size; this will take at least six hours. Set the paste again on the flour ed table, break it up and refold it several times with the hands, return it to the vessel, cover and put it back once more in the same place to rise. Break the paste up again three hours later, put it back into the vessel, and this time set it either in a cool place or on the ice to become firm. It should now be left at least three hours before using. . COOKED PASTE FOR FANCIFUL BORDERS (Pâte Cuite Pour Bordures de Fantaisies). Boil one pint of water with a quarter of a pound of butter and a grain of salt; as soon as the liquid boils remove it from the fire, and incorporate in one pound of flour so as to obtain a good paste, then replace it on to a moderate fire and stir vigorously until it detaches from the bottom of the saucepan, then remove it entirely and pour it on to a flour ed table; as soon as it cools off slightly, knead it with the hands, adding to it slowly one pound more flour; by this time the paste should be perfectly smooth; after it has obtained a consistency, turn it the same as puff paste , giving it seven or eight turns, having the paste remarkably smooth; it must be used at once. .

To knead dough is to put it in front of one, and push it little by little with the palms of both hands and pressing it hard against the table so as to get it smooth; after this is finished, bring it together again, detach carefully all the bits adhering to the table, and roll it into a ball with the hands, turning it in the left hand. Let the paste rest in the ice-box a quarter of an hour before using it. Ordinary Foundation or Short Paste is made with one pound of flour, half a pound of butter, half a pint of water and a third of an ounce of salt. Make a hollow in the center of the flour, put into this the butter, salt and half of the water; work well the paste, adding more water, knead it properly, then roll it into a ball on a flour ed table; cover and let rest for one hour. Flawn Paste. -One and one-quarter pounds of flour, three-quarters pound of butter, a little salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, three or four egg-yolks; make the paste on the table, adding enough water so the paste will not be too firm; knead, bring together and leave to rest, being careful to cover it. .

No. 1. -Put into a vessel, half a pound of flour, a little salt, four tablespoonfuls of oil and three egg-yolks; dilute these with sufficient water at once, so as not to have to add any more, and the size of half an inch ball of compressed yeast dissolved in a little tepid water; mix till it becomes smooth and flows without being stringy; it should well cover the spoon. Lay a cloth over the vessel, and keep it in a moderate temperature. At the last moment add to it three beaten egg-whites. No. 2. -Place in a vessel half a pound of flour, a little salt, two tablespoonfuls of oil, diluted in tepid water, and then add a piece of compressed yeast the size of a half an inch ball, dissolved in a little water. Set the batter in a moderate temperature, and when it begins to ferment, add a handful of flour, salt, oil and water. The batter should be renewed every day without adding yeast; the fermentation produced by the batter will be sufficient to keep it light, and avoid the use of any more yeast. No. 3. -This is a finer preparation, intended for sweet dishes, etc. Take half a pound of flour, dilute it with tepid water, into which an ounce of butter has been melted, also salt; make a soft, very smooth batter and when it has cooled off, add to it half a gill of brandy, two egg-yolks and two whites, beaten to a stiff froth.

MARCHPANE PASTE WITH ORANGE-FLOWER WATER (Pâte Massepain à l'eau de Fleur d'Oranger). One pound of almonds, one pound of sugar, one gill of orange flower-water and the juice of one lemon. Peel the almonds, wash them in cold water, drain on a cloth and pound them with the orange flower-water, adding the sugar and the lemon-juice; obtain a very fine paste and put it into a small saucepan to dry on a slow fire, turning it steadily until all the moisture evaporates and it detaches from the sides and bottom of the pan. A round bottomed saucepan or basin is far preferable to the flat ones, which are in general use. . PLAIN MERINGUE PREPARATION AND WITH COOKED SUGAR (Pâte à Meringue Ordinaire et Avec Sucre Cuit). The preparation for meringues is composed of twelve or fifteen egg-whites for each pound of powdered sugar; set these whites in a basin with a grain of salt and beat up with a whip, very slowly at first, but increasing the velocity of the movement as the quantity becomes greater. The beaten whites should be stiff and remarkably smooth; then mix in the sugar a little at a time, using a wooden spoon for the purpose. Italian Meringue with Cooked Sugar. -Cook one pound of sugar to "ball" ; incorporate a very little of it at a time into six beaten whites, without ceasing to stir; when all the sugar is absorbed work it for two minutes longer on a slow fire to have it very smooth. . MILAN PASTE (Pâte à Milan). Form a hollow in the center of a pound of flour on the table, lay in it half a pound of butter, half a pound of sugar, a little salt and three eggs; mix well and knead the dough twice, then put it aside to rest in a cool place. . NOODLE PASTE, NOODLE PASTE FOR BORDERS AND REPèRE PASTE FOR FASTENING (Pâte à Nouilles, Pâte à Nouilles pour Bordures et à Repère pour Coller). Noodle Paste. -Make a ring on the table with a pound of sifted flour, in the center lay a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of tepid water and five beaten eggs; mix the eggs in slowly with the flour and then wrap the paste in a cloth, leave it to rest for fifteen minutes and afterward knead it well to have it smooth; this requires some time to do. Noodle Paste for Borders. -The same preparation as for the above, the only difference being that the five whole eggs are replaced by ten yolks. This paste can also be used for covering dish bottoms. Paste for Fastening on Borders (Repère). -This is simply sifted flour diluted with beaten egg and passed through a fine wire sieve to obtain a sufficiently liquid paste that can be pushed through a cornet. It should be consistent enough not to run. . OFFICE PASTE (Pâte d'office). Sift one pound of flour on the table, make a hollow in the center, and in this lay half a pound of sugar, two whole eggs and four yolks. Mix all together to form a smooth paste, knead it twice, and let it rest in a cool place before using it. . PIE PASTE (COLD) (Pâte à Pâté) (froid). This is prepared with melted butter as follows: Sift a pound of flour, form a hollow in the center and in it lay four egg-yolks and the third of an ounce of salt dissolved in a little water. Melt eight ounces of butter, pour the clear part slowly into the hollow, then work the flour gradually into it, adding the necessary water and knead the paste at ounce, roll it into a ball and leave to cool. This paste is far mellower than when made with cold butter. Another proportion for cold pie paste is to have one pound of flour, four ounces of butter, four eggs, tepid water and salt; prepare and finish as above. . PASTES FOR HOT PIES (Pâtes à Pâtés Chaud). Lay in a circle on the table one pound of sifted flour; make a hollow in the center and into this put a third of an ounce of salt dissolved in a little water, eight ounces of butter, two egg-yolks and two gills of water. Mix first the butter with the eggs and water, add the flour working it in a little at the time, also pour in a little water as it becomes necessary, being careful not to get the paste too thin, and still avoid being too dry, otherwise it will not hold together well; knead the dough twice, detach it from the table and form it into a ball on the flour ed table, and when smooth, cover and let it rest. Another recipe is: one pound of flour, eight ounces of butter, half a pint of water, four egg-yolks, and a third of an ounce of salt dissolved in water; to be prepared the same as the above. . PUFF PASTE AND HALF PUFF PASTE (Pâte Feuilletée et demi Feuilletée). This paste is actually not so very difficult to make, only it requires particular attention. Weigh one pound of the very best quality, not too fresh, but well dried flour; one pound of butter, well drained and cooled on the ice, then kneaded in a cloth to make it become flexible. Sift the flour on to the table, arrange it in a circle, and put into this one teaspoonful of salt and a glassful of water. With the right hand mix gradually the liquid with the flour, adding more water when necessary, so as to obtain a smooth, even paste, soft in preference to hard, and of a consistency neither stringy nor ropy; as soon as the dough is made, knead it well for two minutes, detaching all the small particles from the table, but if the paste be well made it should adhere neither to the table nor to the hand; cover it with a cloth and let it rest for twelve minutes. Dredge the table lightly with flour, lay the paste on top, and roll it out square shaped, roll out the butter likewise, lay it in the center of the paste, on top, then bring the four outer edges back on to the butter so as to inclose it well (  ); take a pastry rolling pin, apply it on the paste, and using the two hands push the paste and butter forward, rolling it out to the thickness of three sixteenths of an inch or thereabout, keeping it straight on both sides as represented in the following design (  ). Fold this band into three, press it down with the rolling pin to compress it, the accompanying design will show how to fold it (  ). The paste has now only received one turn; to fold it once more, give it a half turn so as to lengthen it to the same thickness, but in a contrary direction, as thin as before; then fold the paste in three, cover it and let it rest for ten or twelve minutes; the paste will now have received two turns, then give it two turns more, exactly the  .

An illustration of Different Stages in making a Puff Paste. same as the others, and let it rest each time for ten minutes. Before giving the last two necessary turns to fine puff paste, it must have already had six, if more are given it will be found detrimental to its delicacy. One special obstacle to be absolutely avoided during the operation is not to let any butter whatever escape from the folds of the paste, which might easily occur if the paste happens to be too soft, if rolled out too thin, if not rolled out regularly in smooth layers, and if it is thicker on one side than the other. In summer it is very difficult to obtain good puff paste without the use of ice or at least without a cold cellar; in any way this inconvenience can be obviated by substituting good beef kidney suet for butter. This fat must first be skinned, then soaked in cold water, well drained, and pounded in a mortar, so as to convert it to a smooth paste, and then made supple by working it with the hands for a few minutes while wrapped in a cloth. If the paste should be made in moist, summer weather it must be laid on a cold baking sheet dredged with flour, and put aside in the ice box. For Half puff paste. -The parings from puff paste make an excellent half paste. If this paste should have to be made, prepare a dough of three-quarters of a pound of butter for one pound of flour, operating exactly the same as for the puff paste, but giving it seven or eight turns instead of six. . RAVIOLE PASTE (Pâte à Raviole). Lay a pound of sifted flour on the table, form a hollow in the center and in it place one ounce of salt, four eggs, two ounces of butter and a little tepid water. Another proportion is one pound of flour, one ounce of salt, two eggs, one ounce of butter, two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated parmesan and a little tepid water. The paste should be soft, yet not too firm, knead it well to have it smooth, lay it on a board, cover with a cloth and let it rest in a cool place for one hour, then roll out and finish making the ravioles. . SAVARIN PASTE {Pâte à Savarin). One pound of flour, half a pound of melted butter, four ounces of sugar, eight eggs, six yolks, half an ounce of yeast, half a gill of raw cream, and a pinch of salt. Sift some of the flour into a warm vessel, and make a soft leaven with a quarter of the flour and the yeast, dilute it with tepid water, and cover it with some more of the flour, then leave it to rise in a warm temperature. When the leaven has risen to half its original size, break up the dough with the hands, and work into it gradually, and one by one the eggs and the remainder of the flour, then knead the dough vigorously for ten minutes to give it a body, add to it slowly the melted butter, afterward the sugar and salt, and lastly the raw cream; the zest of lemon chopped or grated may be added if desired. . TART PASTE (Pâte à Tarte). Make a paste on the table with three-quarters of a pound of flour, a quarter of a pound of arrowroot or fecula, half a pound of butter, three egg-yolks, two gills of cold water and a tablespoonful of sugar, adding a little salt. When the paste is smooth, wrap it up in a cloth, and leave it to rest for twenty-five minutes. . TIMBALE PASTE (Pâte à Timbale). Mix one pound of flour, three-quarters of a pound of butter, four or five egg-yolks, one grain of salt, and one gill of water. Form a paste, reserving a little of the water. Knead it well, then add slowly the rest of the water, roll it out, and set it aside to rest under a cover. . SMALL PUFF PATTIES (Petits Pâtés Feuilletés). Make a puff paste the same as for puff paste , giving it six turns, roll out the paste to three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness, let it rest awhile, then from it cut about fifteen round pieces, using a smooth pastry cutter one and three-quarters to two inches in diameter; collect the parings together at once, roll them out with the rolling pin to one-eighth of an inch thick,  ,  ,  . An illustration of Different Utensils used in Cutting Pastry. and cut the same quantity of round pieces with the same cutter, turn them over on to a wet baking sheet in straight rows, a small distance apart, and lay on each one, a one to one and a quarter inch ball of veal Godiveau forcemeat, or one of fish, chicken, game, with or without chives. Moisten the paste around the garnishing, cover each one with the pieces that were cut first, pressing them down to make the two layers of paste adhere together all around the garnishing; flatten the paste with the back of a small one and a half inch pastry cutter, egg the tops using a soft brush, and cook these small patties in a well heated oven. . TO POACH QUENELLES, SMALL TIMBALES AND MOUSSELINES (Pour Pocher les Quenelles les Petites Timbales et les Mousselines). Quenelles. -Quenelles are poached by pouring hot (nearly boiling) water into a sautoire by the side of the quenelles, set the sautoire on the fire to bring the liquid to a boiling point, and at the first boil, cover the sautoire, remove it to the side of the range so that the water only quivers, and take out the quenelles with a skimmer as soon as they are firm. The length of time to poach quenelles depends upon their size; either ten to fifteen minutes. Dry them on a cloth before dressing. Small Timbales. -Range the timbales in a sautoire; fifteen minutes before serving, fill it to half the height of the molds with boiling water, and set the sautoire on the fire; when the water is ready to boil, remove and place it in a slack oven for ten or fifteen minutes; after a lapse of ten minutes touch the forcemeat in the center, and if firm, take them out, let stand for a little and invert the molds into a cloth to drain off all the liquid. Unmold. Mousselines. -Put these into a flat sautoire furnished with a perforated grater having the holes at regular spaces apart so that each one can receive a mold. The molds being rounded at the bottom, these holes are to keep them standing upright. Pour boiling water into the saucepan nearly sufficient to cover the height of the molds and stand it on the fire; when the water boils, remove and push it gently into a slack oven for ten or fifteen minutes, sufficient time to poach them slowly; they will be found done when touched in the center, they resist to the pressure of the finger, then take them from the water, stand them on one side to drain and unmold. If the oven be too hot the timbales rise, which must be avoided otherwise they lose their quality. . TO PRESS MEATS, GALANTINES, BREASTS, SWEETBREADS, ETC. (Pour Presser les Viandes, Galantines, Poitrines, Ris de veau, etc.). For Meat Juices. -Have a press as shown in  . The meats intended for pressing should be done rare, but cooked through, so that all the juice can be extracted. There is also a press for pressing galantines, sweetbreads, etc. This one is made as represented in  ; besides, there should be a double series of strips of wood, five inches across; the thinnest being a quarter of an inch thick, and the thickest are five inches; these are for the purpose of receiving the movable shelf belonging to the press so that all the pressed articles will be even throughout. For galantines it is also necessary to have a dozen tinned, sheet-iron sheets, a sixteenth of an inch thick, twelve inches long and six inches wide. These sheets are to be used when there are several galantines to equalize their thickness so that they are all pressed uniformly. The size of the press is thirty-eight inches high, twenty-eight inches wide and sixteen inches deep; the screw to be twenty-six inches long, and the wheel one foot in diameter. Press to the required thickness by arranging the strips either higher or lower; for galantines they are put an inch lower than the galantine itself; turn the screw slowly until the movable shelf rests on the two strips which are the thickness required.  ,  . An illustration of Different Kinds of Presses used for Pressing Meats. Sweetbreads are pressed either in round or oval molds, proportionate to the size of the sweetbreads; place these molds, one beside the other, on a shelf of the same dimension as the movable one and fill each one with a piece of unlarded, braised sweetbread just sufficiently large enough to fill up the mold when pressed. For Breast of Mutton or Lamb, Braised and Cooked. -Range them on a board and press with a half inch thick strip on both sides to receive the movable shelf the same as the sweetbreads. Beef Tongues are placed in a mold the shape of the tongue, it being two inches thick, eight and a half inches long and three and a half inches on its widest part. Molds containing two, four, or six tongues can be had. Boned Hams are pressed in oval timbale molds. Corned Beef in square molds, two and a half inches deep. . TO PREPARE DECORATED QUENELLES, MOLDED QUENELLES AND POCKET QUENELLES (Pour Préparer les Quenelles Décorées, Moulées et à la Poche). Large decorated quenelles are used as a garnishing or to complete relevé garnishings; they can be prepared with chicken, game or fish forcemeat. These quenelles are made on pieces of buttered white paper, shaping them to any desired form with a small knife while smoothing the surfaces neatly. Large quenelles are usually decorated with truffles or red beef tongue, the former being preferable. The truffle decoration can be applied on to the quenelles either before or after poaching; in the first case the decorations are slightly incrusted into the forcemeat after wetting them with egg-white; the quenelles are then plunged into boiling water with the paper they have been molded on. If the quenelles are to be decorated after poaching then the pieces must be simply applied on, but first cover, or, better still, dampen one side with soft forcemeat so that they can adhere. Quenelles are poached in salted water without allowing it to boil.  ,  ,  . An illustration of Different Patterns of Quenelles for the Purpose of Decorating. Molded. - Butter some plain, oval-shaped, quenelle molds, using slightly melted butter; decorate the bottom of the mold the same as shown in the design. If required to be stuffed, then place a layer of forcemeat on the decoration and over this any salpicon whatever (see salpicons, No. 165), and finish to fill the mold; smooth the tops, stand the molds on a baking pan, pour enough boiling water in to fill the pan to half the height of the molds and then poach in a slack oven. These molds are simply buttered, filled with forcemeat, smoothed on top and poached.  ,  ,  A. An illustration of Different Molds of Fancy Shapes and Designs used in Making Quenelles. Pocket Quenelles. -Mix together half as much quenelle forcemeat , as cream forcemeat , incorporating the latter gradually into the former, pass it all once more through a fine sieve, and fill a strong paper cornet with a third part of this forcemeat, push small quarter inch quenelles the shape of beads on to a buttered sheet, and then poach them in boiling, salted water. Color half of the remaining forcemeat with a little vegetal carmine, of a fine, light red color, and put this also into a paper cornet, and force them through on to another buttered sheet, letting these quenelles be channeled shaped, poach in salted, boiling water. Color the remainder of the forcemeat with spinach green or vegetal green to obtain a light pistachio color, and set them into a paper cornet also, and with it form oval shaped quenelles on to a buttered sheet, pour over some boiling, salted water, and let them poach for a few minutes. These quenelles are used as garnishings for soups, and for a variety of entrées.  ,  ,  . An illustration of Different Patterns Quenelles.. . TO MOLD QUENELLES WITH A SPOON, EITHER PLAIN, FILLED OR ROLLED IN FLOUR (Pour Mouler les Quenelles à la Cuillère, Simples, Fourées ou Roulées à la Farine). Select two common, large and very thin iron soup spoons, put one of these into a small panful of hot water, and taking the other in the left hand fill the hollow center with the forcemeat, smooth the top with the blade of a small knife dipped in tepid water, arranging it in such a manner that there is as much forcemeat above as below the level of the spoon, then remove the quenelles with the hot spoon sliding it beneath the forcemeat, then slip it at once on to the bottom of a buttered sautéing pan, without turning it over, so that the same side is on top. If the quenelles are wanted filled, prepare a montglas composed of mushrooms, tongue, truffles or foies-gras; thicken it with some very compact reduced, good brown sauce, so that when cold the preparation can be divided into small parts, and rolled into olive shaped pieces in the hand; in this case, when the spoon is filled with forcemeat, make a small hole with the finger on the surface so as to insert the montglas, salpicon or purée, cover over with more forcemeat, being careful that it is the same thickness all over the filling, smooth it down nicely, and remove the quenelle with the hot spoon to slip it on to the bottom of a buttered sautéing pan without turning it over. Generally for one pound it will take eight large soup-spoonfuls, or sixteen dessert-spoons, or thirty-two tea-spoons, or sixty-four coffee-spoons. Poach these quenelles by pouring hot water into the sautéing pan beside the quenelles, and set the pan on the fire to bring it to boiling point; at the first boil, move it on one side, so that the water only simmers for six to fourteen minutes, according to their size. Lift the quenelles with a skimmer, and drain them on a cloth before using them.  . An illustration of Two Hands Holding a Spoon Each. Spoon in the Right Hand is Tilted towards the Spoon in the Left Hand.  ,  ,  ,  . An illustration of Quenelles in Different Shapes. To Prepare Quenelles Rolled in Flour. -Divide some game, chicken or fish forcemeat into pieces; roll each one on a flour dredged table into strings three-quarters of an inch in diameter; cut these into pieces three-quarters of an inch long; roll them on the table to give each one the shape of an olive or small egg half an inch in thickness and one inch in length. Larger ones can be made of Godiveau an inch and three-quarters long by five-eighths in thickness. Poach the quenelles in boiling water with salt added to it. The Godiveau quenelles are poached by ranging them at equal distances on a baking tin covered with a sheet of paper, then placing it in very slack oven. . TO RAISE, PARE AND POACH BREASTS OF POULTRY AND GAME (Pour Lever, Parer et Pocher les Filets de Volaille et de Gibier à Plumes). Cut off the pinions from a clean, singed chicken, split the breast skin from one end to the other in the center, open it so as to disclose the flesh, then detach the breasts with a small knife following the breast-bone, and leaving the minion fillets adhering to them, removing them later if not needed. Take these breasts one by one, lay them the smoothest side uppermost on a table, press them down with the left hand and slip the blade of a knife between the flesh and the skin, so as to remove the latter at one pull without breaking it. Beat the breasts lightly with a damp knife handle, trim them in round half hearts on one end, and pointed on the other; remove the inside nerve, and the fine skin from the minion fillet, beat these lightly and lay them on the inside surface of the breasts, if found necessary to enlarge them, but unless the breasts are very small, they are not added. They can be interlarded either with slices of truffle or tongue, by cutting five or six incisions across the minion-fillet and garnishing them with either of these. Proceed exactly in the same manner for breasts of game. To Poach. -Place the breasts of poultry or game in a buttered sauteing pan; turn all the points toward the center and on them, place a sheet of buttered paper, put on the cover and set the pan in a slack oven leaving it in long enough to poach according to their size and quality. . TO CLEAN CURRANTS, MALAGA AND SMYRNA RAISINS (Pour Nettoyer les Raisins de Corinthe, les Raisins de Malaga, et de Smyrne). Lay the currants on a table mixing in with them some flour, rub well together, then shake them through a coarse sieve, having eight meshes so that the small currant stalks pass through; wash well and dry them, then pick them over to free them of all the gravel stones which are generally to be found in these fruits, as well as the large stalks adhering to them. Smyrna (Sultana) raisins are cleaned the same as currants; abstain from washing them. Seed Malaga raisins and pick off the stalks. . RAVIOLES (Ravioles). Roll out some raviole paste , very thin and in a perfect square; lay on top half an inch from the edge and one inch apart some chicken raviole forcemeat balls , three-quarters of an inch in diameter, after the entire flat is covered, moisten it lightly by passing a brush around the forcemeat balls and then place another flat of paste on top, it to be the same thickness as the under one and about four inches wider. Press on to this upper paste between the balls of forcemeat with a ruler and the whole length of the flat and then across so that every one of the balls is enclosed in a small square; cut each of these out with a channeled wheel or jagger (  ). The jaggers are used for cutting lattice work bands for pies, or else replace it by a round channeled pastry cutter. Lay the cut pieces on a flour dredged saucepan lid and then drop them into boiling water to poach for about twelve minutes.  .

An illustration of Two People Straining Liquid from a Piece of Cloth into a Wooden Sink. The reason sauces are reduced is to give them the delicacy and succulence necessary to their finish, by incorporating into them fumets, stocks and the required condiments. The stocks that are to be added to the sauces in order to reduce them should be as concentrated as possible so as to avoid any superfluous labor. In order to reduce a strained, despumated sauce, pour it into a flat saucepan having a thick bottom, set it on a brisk fire and let the sauce boil while stirring it well with a spatula, and pressing it down in a way that the sauce will fail to adhere to the bottom, and therefore burn. Mix in gradually the stock needed for its improvement, and continue to boil until it has acquired the necessary consistency and succulence, then take it off, and strain it through a tammy. . RICE FOR CROUSTADES AND RICE WITH CREAM (Riz Pour Croustades et riz à la Crème). Pick well four pounds of Carolina rice, put it into a newly tinned saucepan without washing it, adding a half pound piece of fresh pork, moisten it to three times its height with some water; heat the liquid on a moderate fire, and at the first boil, remove it to a slower one; twenty minutes after when the liquid is nearly all absorbed, cover the rice with a heavy buttered paper, close the saucepan, and set it at the opening of a slack oven, finish cooking the rice, drying it thoroughly, then remove the saucepan from the oven, take out the piece of pork, and work the rice while still in the saucepan, using a spatula for the purpose, then pound it again in a mortar so as to reduce it to a smooth paste. Lay this rice on a dampened marble slab, or a thick baking sheet, knead it with the hands so that it becomes smooth, mold it round shaped, and set it in a saucepan, buttered over with a brush, or else a mold proportionate to the size needed for the croustade. Press the rice down well, cover the top with a round sheet of buttered paper, and set it in the ice box for seven or eight hours, but not allowing the saucepan or mold to touch the ice. Unmold the rice after dipping the saucepan in hot water, cutting it out with a knife. Rice with Cream. -Blanch for a few moments half a pound of fine, picked and washed rice; drain and refresh, then put it back into the saucepan and moisten it with one quart of boiled milk in which a stick of vanilla has been infused. Let the liquid come again to a boil, cover the saucepan, and finish cooking the whole very slowly for forty minutes. When the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, add to it a pinch of salt, three ounces of sugar, two ounces of fresh butter and a few spoonfuls of whipped cream. Sometimes a few egg-yolks are added to this rice, if so, they must be put in before any other of the ingredients, while the rice has all its heat, so that the eggs can cook while in the act of stirring them. . TO PREPARE RISSOLES (Pour Préparer les Rissoles). Rissoles are prepared in two different ways, the first, by rolling out some fine paste or clippings of puff paste, into a long, thin piece from ten to fourteen inches wide; wet the bottom edges of this paste, then lay on it four balls of an inch and a quarter in diameter for the two and three-quarter inch rissoles made of rissole preparation, and from two and three-eighths inches distance apart from each other, and two inches from the edges; refold the paste forward, so as to cover up the prepared balls, and fasten the paste down to six-eighths of an inch around the balls; press on the two layers of paste to adhere them together, then cut out the rissoles half circular with a channeled pastry-cutter either two and one-quarter, two and one-half or two and three-quarters inches in diameter. As soon as the rissoles of the first row are cut, lay them aside; pare the edges of the paste and begin the operation again; reduce the height of the cut out rissoles by pressing them down with the finger without mishaping them. These rissoles may now be breaded and dipped in egg, or left white; in the first case, lay them simply on a tin sheet covered with a white paper till ready to fry. In the second, place them at some distance apart on a flour ed cloth so that the paste cannot adhere to it. To prepare rissoles differently, roll out a thin flat, cut it into small round pieces with a channeled pastry-cutter either two and one-quarter, two and one-half or two and three-quarters inches in diameter, and on each one of these, lay a prepared rissole ball; wet the paste all round, and fold the piece of paste over the ball fastening the two edges together. Press the tops lightly with the fingers, keeping them a good shape, and lay the unbreaded ones on a flour ed cloth, and the breaded ones on white paper.  ,  . An illustration of Rissoles Cut in Fancy Shapes. . TO CUT ROOTS WITH A SPOON AND WITH A VEGETABLE CUTTER (Couper les Racines à la Cuillère et à la Machine). Peel or scrape carrots, peel turnips, celery roots, turnip-cabbage or kohl-rabi, sweet potatoes or common potatoes ; wash and keep them into cold water until needed; all of these vegetables including peeled truffles can be cut olive shaped or in rounds large or small according to requirements (  ). The rounds should be from a quarter of an inch to one inch in diameter; the long ovals from half an inch to one and a quarter inches. The oval spoons for this purpose may be either plain or channeled. When cutting vegetables with a spoon into either balls or olives dip the sharp end of the spoon into the thickest part of the root all through the depth and endeavor to remove the pieces as whole and perfect as possible.  ,  . An illustration of a Spoon and a Vegetable Cutter. Vegetable Cutter. -(  ). This utensil is simple, practical and useful. It is used for cutting vegetables and roots into various shapes for soups or garnishing; having them pass by pressure through the deep cutters made of steel and movable so they can be easily changed when so desired. To proceed, first cut the roots into thin slices, all of equal thickness; place one of these on any one of the selected cutters; put this under the press and bear heavily on it. The pieces will fall through; pick out the imperfect ones; the others are ready to use. . BLONDE AND BROWN ROUX (Roux blond et brun). Roux is flour fried in butter and allowed to attain more or less color; it is used for thickening gravies, soup stocks and sauces; there are two kinds of roux, the blonde and the brown; the blonde is made as follows: Put into a saucepan to melt, one pound and two ounces of butter, add to it one pound of sifted flour and place the saucepan on a moderate fire to let it cook slowly while stirring until it becomes of a light blonde; this is used for velouté. For the brown, leave it on the fire or in a slack oven until it assumes a darker color; should it not be necessary to use it at once, pour it into a vessel, and employ it as needed, but when required for immediate use, take it from the fire, leave it in the pan and let it lose a few degrees of its heat before moistening it. For a velouté, dilute it with a white velouté stock, and a brown espagnole stock if needed for brown; the proportions for both velouté and espagnole being: one pound and two ounces of butter, one pound of flour and four quarts of either white or brown stock. . RUM FLAVORED WITH VANILLA; SPIRIT OF STRAWBERRIES, RASPBERRIES AND APRICOTS (Rhum Vanillé; Esprit de Fraises, Framboises et Abricots). Rum flavored with Vanilla. -Put twelve vanilla beans cut in pieces in a quart bottle with a quarter of a pint of boiling water, twelve hours later fill up the bottle with good rum and leave it for ten days; it will then be ready for use. Spirit of Strawberries, etc. -Crush thirty pounds of strawberries or raspberries; to this pulp add three quarts of spirits of wine, put into an earthen crock, cover and leave to infuse for fifteen days. Distill the fruits in an alembic in a bain-marie and continue the distillation until the liquor reaches twenty degrees. Spirit of apricots is made the same way only taking twenty pounds of fruit instead of thirty for each three quarts of spirit. The fruits are pressed through a sieve and the kernels broken and crushed in a mortar, then mixed in with the apricots. . SALPICON; HOW TO PREPARE (Salpicon; Manière de le Préparer). Salpicons are prepared with cooked and cold meats and fish, red beef tongue, sweetbreads or beef palates; they are also made of chicken or game fillets, foies-gras, also with truffles, mushrooms, cèpes, and besides these, oysters, lobsters, crawfish, etc. The characteristic of salpicon is that it is cut into small squares; they may be prepared with one kind of substance alone, but are generally mixed, for example: chickens, with red beef tongue, truffles or mushrooms; game, with foies-gras or truffles, and fish, with mushrooms and truffles. Salpicons are always thickened with a sauce corresponding to the nature of the meat, and in all cases it must be succulent and condensed. . TO SCALD (Échander). In an analogous sense, scalding means to dip, to plunge in boiling water. A pig, a suckling pig, calf 's head and feet of either the calf or sheep, chicken's legs and even whole poultry is scalded. To scald a pig is to detach the bristles adhering to its back by means of hot water, done by dipping it once or twice in hot water to facilitate pulling them out more readily, then scrape the surface with a knife; this operation must be performed as quickly as possible. The same to be done for calf 's feet and head, also for sheep and lamb's trotters. Poultry is sometimes scalded, but this system of treatment should be completely abandoned and the feathers picked off dry, this being far superior to the scalding process; for by scalding poultry, especially young chickens they become partially cooked and the skin is apt to tear when being trussed; they also contract a bad taste and decompose quicker than those that are dry picked. . SIEVE-CLOTH OF DIFFERENT SIZE MESHES (Toile à Tamis de Différentes Grosseurs).   (four mesh) is used for broken and coarsely chopped almonds;   (six mesh) is used for Mocha sugar, finely chopped almonds and raisins;   (eight mesh) is used for bread crumbs;   (twelve mesh) is used for powdered macaroons, purées and marmalades;   (sixteen mesh) is used for sugar, flour and purées;   (twenty-eight mesh) is used for icing sugar. A mesh indicates the number of holes to each linear inch.  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . An illustration of Different Kinds of Sieves Used for Different Size of Meshes. . SPICES, AROMATICS, AND SEASONINGS FOR COOKING PURPOSES (Épices, Aromates et Assaisonnements pour la Cuisine). The different articles employed as seasonings in kitchen work are comprised of salt, spices, aromatics, butter, fat, vinegar, oil and mustard. Salt is without exception the most indispensable seasoning; it removes the insipid taste from meats, vegetables and all other eatables. It excites the appetite and helps digestion, but of course must be used with judgment, for too much is apt to make it unhealthy. Coarse salt is the one to be used for cooking boiled meats and vegetables. Finely pulverized white salt is for table use and the one used in kitchens for seasoning is merely crushed and sifted purified salt. Spices are of different kinds; they are void of nutritious properties and are only for the purpose of improving the taste of various foods. They are composed of common black and white pepper, cayenne pepper; then come the weaker spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and coriander. For seasoning, common raw pepper, ground only when ready to use is both agreeable and a tonic, but as much cannot be said for pepper cooked in stews, sauces or soups, for it loses its aroma while cooking and therefore only the acridity remains. Peppers that do not deteroriate while cooking are paprika (a Hungarian product), and red pepper; these both give a most agreeable flavor to stews and sauces, increasing as the cooking proceeds, and either of them are agreeable to the taste and a tonic without producing any irritating results. Aromatics. -Among the most aromatic plants used in the kitchen must be mentioned bay leaf, marjoram, chives, sage, thyme, wild thyme, savory, tarragon, pimpernel, chervil, pepper -cress, parsley, onion, shallot, garlic and horseradish root. Some of these are used in a dry state, others in a fresh, and both are employed in numerous preparations. They can be used in sautés, braizés, in sauces and even in soups. The action of these aromatics on the general health is only injurious when indulged in injudiciously or in too large quantities, but when employed with a certain reserve, they are both healthy, stimulating and agreeable. Curry, the Best, comes from India. -An imitation curry is made of one ounce of coriander seeds, two ounces of cayenne, a quarter of an ounce of cardamon seeds, one ounce salt, two ounces of tumeric, one ounce ginger, half an ounce of mace and a third of an ounce of saffron. Prepared Red Pepper is made with paprika (Hungarian red pepper ), and Spanish sweet pimentos mixed in equal quantities. In case paprika cannot be had use quarter cayenne pepper and three-quarters Spanish pimentos. Spices. -Before grinding spices be careful that they are the freshest; grind each kind separately and sift them through a silk sieve, then mix thoroughly and put them into hermetically closed bottles, and set these in a cool place (they are only to be mixed when ready to use). Spices for Bread Stuffing, use two ounces of sage, one ounce of marjoram, half an ounce of cayenne pepper, half an ounce of allspice, one ounce of thyme, two ounces of white pepper, a quarter of an ounce of nutmeg, and half an ounce of finely minced green celery leaf. Spices for Game Pies, and Galantines are one pound of cinnamon, one pound of nutmeg, one pound of cloves, one pound of whole peppers, three ounces of cayenne pepper, three ounces of sweet Spanish pepper, three ounces of thyme and three ounces of bay leaf. These spices should be mixed in the proportion of one ounce to a pound of salt. Spices for General Use. -Two ounces of cinnamon, two ounces of nutmeg, two ounces of cloves, two ounces of white pepper, twelve ounces of red pepper, four ounces of mace, two ounces of thyme, two ounces of sage, two ounces of marjoram, two ounces of rosemary. One ounce of spices to two pounds of salt. Spices for Turtle Soup. -Two ounces of curry, half an ounce of thyme, two ounces dry mushrooms, half an ounce of sage, a quarter of an ounce of mace, half an ounce garden citron, half an ounce of basil, half an ounce marjoram, half of the peel of a chopped lemon, two ounces of white pepper. These aromatics and spices are used when there is no time to prepare a stock, or when preserved turtle has to be used. Two ounces of spices to one pound of salt. Spices for Goose Liver Patties (Pâté de foies gras). -Four ounces of nutmeg, four ounces of cloves, four ounces of basil, four marjoram, four of thyme, two and a half ounces of black pepper, three ounces of white pepper, two and one-third ounces of bay leaf, two and a half ounces of mace, two and a half ounces of ginger, two and a third of coriander seeds, one and two-thirds ounce of sweet pepper. One ounce of these mixed spices to every two pounds of salt. . STEARINE; HOW TO CAST AND COLOR IT (Stéarine; Manière de la Couler et de la Colorer). Casting stearine in plaster molds is most simple and only requires a little attention. Tinned copper molds should be smooth in the inside and even polished. Put all the plaster molds in a vessel after separating each piece and leave them in tepid water for half an hour or longer according to their size. For tinned copper molds coat them first with a thin layer of stearine, then place another layer on this first one and continue until the stearine be sufficiently thick. The stearine must be melted in a bain-marie or on a slow fire, being careful to keep it stirred and also not to heat it too violently so that it remains white, for if too greatly heated it turns yellow and thereby loses its beautiful white appearance; if this should happen it should only be used to coat the inside of large pieces or else for pads for filling the inside of borders. To cast stearine in plaster molds, take the molds from the water, drain them out for a moment and then fit each piece into its respective place; tie around firmly, fill up with the melted stearine and when a light crust has formed on the surface, break it and empty out the mold; let rest for one minute, put it back into the water, remove and unmold with the greatest care. Should the unmolded pieces fail to be smooth or else be creased, this is caused by the stearine not being sufficiently warm and the molds too cold, and that the stearine was cast too slowly. This is of great importance to observe and is most essential when perfection is required. When the objects intended for casting are frail, such as rings, arms, figures or other thin pieces, it will be advisable to insert thin wires into these parts before casting the stearine in the mold. After unmolding the subjects, wash the mold well, being careful that no particles of stearine remain in the joints, so that it can be thoroughly closed and the stearine cannot escape through these joints. Scrape the seams or moldings carefully. Stearine subjects can be colored with one or more colors; for this purpose use water paints (tubes in preference). This kind is mostly employed for this work and to it add a little beef gall to enable the paint to adhere on to the greasy surface. Use a soft badger brush and proceed with care; always wait until the first coat be dry before applying another. With a little taste and skill subjects can be painted so that a great effect is produced, especially for the larger ones. When required to be bronzed, mix a few drops of gum arab with a little of the gall, add bronze powder and a little water; stir well, keeping it the consistency of honey. Paint over the subject with a camel's hair brush and if one coat be not sufficient then give another, adding a little more water. . TO STRAIN PURÉES (Pour passer les purées).  . An illustration of two People Straining a Piece of Cloth with a Spoon into a Wooden Sink. Vegetable, chicken, crustacean, and game purées are strained through a tammy (  ) in order to obtain them as fine as possible. To accomplish this it will require the service of two persons: take hold of the tammy on both sides, pour the purée into its hollow center, then have two wooden spoons one laying in the other, and press them vigorously against the tammy, allowing the purée  a,  b. An illustration of Different Kinds of Wooden Strainers. to fall into a deep dish set underneath; this is easily accomplished and depends entirely upon the regular motion of the two spoons, as they must advance backward and forward without getting separated, or use either one of the machines shown in Figs. 99a and 99b. . TO COOK SUGAR (Pour cuire le sucre). In former days sugars were less refined than in our time, therefore it was most important that they should undergo the operation of clarification, or, as the very word implies rid them of their impurities and make them perfectly clear. To-day this operation is almost useless, however, in case of necessity we will give the exact manner of proceeding, for it may sometimes be found useful. Put twenty pounds of sugar into a copper basin, melt it with two-thirds of its quantity of water, or one-half pint of water to each pound of sugar, set it on the fire, and when the scum begins to rise, throw in some egg-whites beaten up with water, the proportions being one white for each quart of water; do not stir it again, but let it rise to the surface twice, then pour in half a pint of clear water without eggs; let it rise a third time, and as it does so, remove from off the fire and skim it. Return it to one side of the fire to let it boil and drive the scum on one side of the basin, skim this off as quickly as it gathers. Soon the sugar will become very fine, clear and transparent, but if otherwise, then let it boil till it clarifies thoroughly and pass it through the flannel bag. Sugar clarified by this process is ready to be submitted to all kinds of cooking which we explain further on. The cooking of sugar is easily measured by a thermometer, but a clever workman will quickly find it out by the mere touch. These various cookings take different names which we will now endeavor to explain. First -Lissé ou Petit Filet or Small Thread. -Cook the sugar, and in order to be sure that it has reached the first cooking, take out a little of the sugar with a spoon, dip the index finger in it and apply the finger to the thumb; separate the two fingers immediately, the sugar should then form a small thread, the thermometer marking two hundred and fifteen degrees Fahrenheit, (one hundred and one degrees Centigrade). Second -Grand Lissé or Large Thread. -At two hundred and seventeen degrees, the sugar stretches a little more between the fingers, it is now cooked to large thread (one hundred and two degrees Centigrade). Third -Petit Perlé or Little Pearl. -The sugar reaches this cooking when between the two fingers it stretches and forms a thread that breaks. The thermometer is then two hundred and twenty degrees (one hundred and five degrees Centigrade). Fourth -Grand Perlé or Large Pearl. -As soon as the sugar extends from one finger to the other without breaking it has reached large pearl, two hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and six Centigrade). Fifth -Au soufflé ou Glue, or the Blow. -Dip a skimmer into the sugar, knock it at once against the edges of the basin, blow through the skimmer so as to make the small bubbles fly out, and when they do so properly, the sugar has reached its degree of cooking. The thermometer now marks two hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and ten degrees Centigrade). Sixth -Petit Boulé or Small Ball. -Dip the finger first into cold water, then in the sugar, and immediately into water; if the sugar has reached to proper cooking or small ball, it can be rolled into a soft ball between the fingers, two hundred and thirty-six to two hundred and thirty-eight degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and fourteen to one hundred and fifteen degrees Centigrade). Seventh -Grand Boulé or Large Ball. -When the thermometer reaches two hundred and forty-six to two hundred and forty-eight degrees Fahrenheit or one hundred and nineteen to one hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade, then the ball instead of remaining soft when rolled between the fingers, becomes solid and hard, the sugar has now reached large ball. Eighth -Petit Cassé or Small Crack. -Dip the tip of the finger into cold water, then into the sugar and rapidly into cold water again, so as to detach it from the finger; if it has reached its proper cooking it should break. The thermometer is now two hundred and ninety degrees Fahrenheit (one hundred and forty-three degrees Centigrade). Ninth -Cassé or Crack. -Letting the sugar boil a few minutes longer, it will reach the crack; now dip the finger into cold water, then into the sugar, and again into the water, the sugar must break between the teeth without adhering to them. It reaches this degree when the thermometer is at three hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit (or one hundred and fifty-four degrees Centigrade). Tenth. Grand Cassé or Large Crack or Caramel. -This last cooking is exceedingly delicate and requires the most particular care, so as to avoid having the sugar turn black which it is apt to do very easily. When reaching this last cooking, the sugar slightly loses its whiteness and assumes a shade scarcely perceptible to the eye; this is when the thermometer reaches three hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and it is now time to add to each twenty pounds of sugar, a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Continue the cooking and when the thermometer reaches three hundred and forty-five to three hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit, then remove the basin quickly from the fire, and instantly pour its contents on a marble to get cold. These are the various degrees the cooking of sugar undergoes, practice alone makes perfect in this particular work, which can only be acquired after much study and attention. . SUGARS OF DIFFERENT COLORS, AND ICING SUGAR (Sucres de Différentes Couleurs et Sucre à glace Impalpable). For Pink, have powdered sugar from which icing sugar has been sifted, spread it on a baking-sheet covered with white paper, lay the tin on top of a very moderate fire, and pour into it sufficient carmine to give it the necessary color; mix and rub it slowly between the hands until the moisture contained in the carmine be entirely evaporated, then sift it through a sixteen mesh sieve (  ). For Yellow. -Prepare the sugar the same as for the pink, using Breton vegetal yellow. For Orange. -The same as the pink, coloring with Breton vegetal orange, or yellow and red mixed to imitate orange. Lilac and Violet. -The same as the pink, coloring it with red and ultramarine blue, or else with Breton vegetal lilac or violet. Blue. -Breton vegetal blue and ultramarine blue. Green. -Breton vegetal green, or else spinach green or watercress green. Icing Sugar. -There are very few cities where powdered sugar is unobtainable, also icing sugar (confectionery sugar ), but in case it has to be prepared at home the following remarks will be found useful. Pound some lump sugar to the finest powder, pass it through an ordinary sieve, then through an icing sieve called a drum; this latter includes two sieves, one for passing ordinary sugar and another much finer for passing the icing sugar, meaning exceedingly fine powdered sugar almost impalpable. . BAND TART (Tourte à bande). Roll out on a flour ed table, a layer of foundation paste , cut in this a round, eight inches in diameter, lay this round on a small baking-sheet, moisten the border with a brush, and apply on this wet part, a puff- paste border having received six turns, five-eighths of an inch in thickness, one and one-half inches wide and twenty-six inches long; cut the two ends bias, fasten them together after slightly dampening them and set the tart aside in a cool place for fifteen minutes. Prepare an egg wash of well beaten whole eggs, or the yolks alone diluted in a little cold water, apply it to the border, prick the inside or else put in a small mold, to prevent it inflating, then set the tart in a hot oven the same as for a vol-au-vent for thirty or forty minutes. After removing it from the fire, detach it from the sheet, and lay it on a dish to keep warm.  . An illustration of a Round Mold. . EMPTY TARTS, ANCIENT STYLE (Tourtes à l'Ancienne). Spread on a baking-sheet a layer of foundation paste eight inches in diameter; wet the edges of this crust using a brush, and lay on the center a spherical shaped pad, four and three-quarters in diameter and two and one-half high, made of paper and wrapped in slices of fat pork. Cover this pad with an upper layer of paste made with puff- paste clippings, fasten the upper and lower crusts together by pressing them down with the thumb, and cut away the surplus paste with the tip of a small knife, following the outlines of the lower crust. Moisten the edges of the crust and place it on a band of six turned puff paste , an inch and a half wide, by twenty-six inches long, and three-eighths of an inch thick; cut off the ends on the bias, wet them slightly and fasten them together with the finger; channel the band lightly, decorate the dome with leaves cut from the paste, egg the surface, also the band, and bake the tart for thirty to forty minutes in a well heated, but not too hot oven. After removing the tart from the fire, cut the dome at the base so as to remove the pad; it is now ready to fill.  . An illustration of a Round Plate with Paste Stacked in the center of it. . THICKENINGS FOR SOUPS, SAUCES AND STEWS (Liaisons pour Potages, Sauces et Ragoûts). Thickening for Soups. -Put some egg-yolks into a bowl, beat them up with a wooden spoon and dilute with a few spoonfuls of good raw cream; some broth, or cold sauce; pass this through a sieve or tammy, add a dash of grated nutmeg and a few bits of fine butter. Boil well the soup, remove it to one side of the range and mix in the strained thickening; return it to the hot fire, to let cook without ceasing to stir and especially without letting it boil. For Sauces. -This thickening is composed of egg-yolks beaten and diluted with some cold broth or raw cream. In order to thicken the sauce, it should necessarily be boiling, then remove it from the hot fire and stir a spoonful or more of it into the thickening, then pour the rest of the thickening into the sauce and cook it while stirring over a slow fire, without permitting it to boil. All sauces thickened with eggs must afterward be strained through a tammy. Thickening or Liaison Prepared Ready to Use. -Twenty-five egg-yolks for one quart of cream; mix well together, pass it through a fine strainer and keep it in a pot (  ) in order to thicken sauces and stews as they are needed. Butter and Cream Thickening. -Incorporate some butter and cream, and just when ready to serve, stir it vigorously (do not heat it again), and serve it at once. Blood Thickening. -Reserve the blood of poultry or game, adding to it a little vinegar to prevent it from coagulating, then strain it through a sieve and stir it in gradually when needed to thicken a sauce. Arrowroot, Fecula and Cornstarch Thickening. -Dilute one or the other of these with some water, broth or cold milk; strain through a sieve, and pour it into the liquid, stirring it continuously. Thickening of Kneaded Butter. -Incorporate as much flour into butter as it will absorb to form a soft paste; mix it in small parts in the sauce, stirring constantly until all the butter is melted. . TO LINE AND BAKE TIMBALE CRUSTS (Pour Foncer et Cuire les Croûtes à Timbales). Butter a plain timbale mold, five inches in diameter at the bottom, five and a quarter across the top and five and a half inches deep. If the timbale is to be decorated, apply some bits of sweetened noodle paste against the sides and bottom of the mold, dampen them with a brush dipped in water and then line the timbale with a paste not rolled out too thin. With a pastry cutter, two inches in diameter narrower than the mold, cut the paste from the bottom, but do not remove it; cover the whole surface of the paste with buttered white paper and fill in the empty space with common flour; dampen the edges, and cover the top first with a round piece of buttered paper, and then with a layer of the same paste, fastening it down to the dampened sides. Egg over the surface, and let it rest for fifteen minutes in a cool place, then set the timbale on a round baking sheet and cook it for fifty minutes in a hot oven. After removing it, unmold, open the top (the end which before was the bottom), and lift up the round piece previously cut with the pastry cutter, and which can easily be removed, then take out all the flour through this opening, also the paper, and brush the inside twice over with egg-yolks, then lay the timbale for a very few moments in a very hot oven so that it browns nicely, and range it on a dish to be garnished. . TO BRUSH AND PEEL TRUFFLES (Pour Brosser et Peler les Truffes). Put some raw, fresh truffles into cold water; wash them well, changing the water, then take them out one by one, and rub the surfaces over strongly with a hard brush, and throw them as fast as they are done into c lean water, drain; take them out again one by one, and remove with a small knife all those parts the brush failed to touch, then refresh them leaving them as little as possible in the water. Wipe the truffles on a cloth, and with the tip of a knife detach all the skin covering them, cutting it away as thinly as possible, put the truffles as fast as they are done into a saucepan with a well-fitting lid; put also the peelings into a saucepan, and keep them in a cool place while waiting to be used. . TO DRESS, SINGE AND TRUSS POULTRY AND GAME FOR ENTREES (Pour Habiller, Flamber et Brider la Volaille et le Gibier à Plume pour Entrées). After having dressed (drawn) and singed the pieces of poultry or game, remove the fork and breastbone, lifting it out through the neck without injuring the breasts; cut the legs below the joint, suppress the drumstick bones, and slip the leg into its place, having previously burned the top of the leg with alcohol so as to remove the outer skin. To truss either capon, young turkey, pullet, chicken or guinea- fowl : first, have a trussing needle threaded with some strong string, pass it through one thigh to the other and in the joint of the thick part of the leg, then cross through the wing directing the needle toward the neck, and take up the skin of the neck while passing through it, fastening it down to the back; pass through the other wing, tighten the string so that the wings and thigh are well attached to the body of the fowl, and the breasts are quite prominent. Secondly, with the needle cross through the back near the rump, direct the needle so that it passes the thickest part of the two legs, fasten the string strongly so that the thigh is well attached to the side, thrust the posterior inside, and tie it down with a few turns of a string. To prepare geese and tame ducks for entrées, suppress the wings and neck, singe and pick them, cut off the claws, truss the legs inside, and fasten them down by crossing through with the needle at the joints of the thighs and the stumps of the wings; give them a rounded appearance, and push the posterior into the inside, and tie it firmly in place. For squabs, partridges and quails : pluck the feathers, singe and lightly pick them and draw them through the pouch; then truss them by making an incision in the rump, and tie them the same as the chickens.  ,  ,  . An illustration od Different Stages of Dressing and Trussing Poultry. . TO DRESS, SINGE AND TRUSS POULTRY AND GAME FOR ROASTING. (Pour Habiller, Flamber et Brider la Volaille et le Gibier à Plume pour Rôtir). Dressing poultry and feathered game consists of first bleeding, then plucking out the feathers, drawing, singing and trussing them. To dress a chicken it must first be singed lightly all over with spirits of wine set afire, or over a gas-jet, in order to remove every vestige of feathers. When the poultry or game is singed, then pick out all the feather-stumps remaining in the skin. Burn off the skin from the legs to enable it to be taken off with a cloth. To singe small birds stick them simply on small skewers four or six at a time and pass them over a flame. For drawing a chicken cut on the back of the neck making a long aperture through which the pouch and wind pipe can be removed; put the index finger into the interior following the neck to detach the lungs adhering to the inside; make a small opening next to the rump to empty the chicken entirely and then wipe out the insides, cut the skin below the head, chop the neck off on a level with the breast chop off the feet and the end of the pinions and cross the wings over the back of the chicken. Thread a long piece of string into a large trussing needle, lay the chicken on the table, pressing it down on its back, then with the open left hand take hold of the two thighs, so as to keep them held up at an equal height, pass through the flesh with the needle just below the drum -sticks, turn the chicken over on its side to thread it through the wings, running the needle through the breast skin; pull the string tight tie it on the side with a knot, and lay the chicken once more on its back, press the thighs down again with the left hand and run the needle through above the drumsticks, then turn the chicken over on its side, and introduce the needle across the carcass, and at a quarter of the length of the bird near the rump to the other side, to meet the other end of the string and then tie it into a knot (  ). In this manner the chicken is properly trussed, and both knots being on the same side, they are easily cut and the string pulled out when the chicken is cooked. Pheasants, partridges and pigeons are to be trussed the same way when intended for roasting. After the poultry or game is trussed, lard it with thin slices of fresh pork, sufficiently large to cover the whole breast, pare them square shaped, score them lightly on one side, and lay them over the breast, fastening them on with a string as shown in  .  ,  ,  ,  ,  .

Wild Ducks (Canvas Backs, Red Heads, Black Heads, Mallard, Ruddy, Teal, etc.). -Select two fine red head ducks, pick them as far up as one inch from the head, being very careful not to tear the skin; singe and draw. In order to accomplish this, the skin must be cut the whole length of the neck from its beginning until the back of the head is reached, remove the pouch and windpipe, stick the finger in the neck far down in the inside to detach the lights from the bones and all adhering to the breast, make an incision above the rump and take out the gizzard drawing up the whole of the insides; cut the neck where it begins at the carcass, cutting the skin as far up as it is picked. Wipe the duck carefully, thrust the feet inside and season it interiorly with salt and mignonette. Should the duck be gamy it must have the inside washed out. Pick the feathers from the head and separate it where the neck finishes; pick out the eyes and place the head in the opening that was used for drawing the bird; truss the duck bringing the feet toward the front and passing the trussing needle threaded with string near  ,  .

Run the needle through the duck under the breast and then across the other thigh, pressing the duck down well so as to round well the breast, bring the neck skin down on the back and run the needle on the bias through the pinion- bone at the same time through the neck skin to pass it through the other pinion and return from whence it started, pull the string tight and push the rump inward, running the needle through to keep it in place, and bringing it back to one inch from its starting point, passing it through the skin and through the head by the eyes, fasten the two ends of string together tying them firmly. . VOL-AU-VENT CRUST (Croûte de vol-au-vent). Prepare a puff paste with one pound of fine, dry flour and one pound of good butter, proceeding as for No. 146 ; give it six and a half turns, and when the paste is made, lay it on a flour ed baking tin, and set on top of it a model of tin or heavy cardboard having the exact dimensions desired for the vol-au-vent, cut the paste all around this, with a small, heated knife, following the outlines of the model, but keeping the knife slightly inclined outward. As soon as the vol-au-vent is cut, turn it with one stroke upside down on to another dampened round baking sheet, being careful not to injure its shape; groove the edges lightly with the back of a knife as represented in the plate (  ); egg the surfaces over, and trace a ring, using the tip of a small knife an inch and a half from the edge, then in the center of this ring trace four or five light incisions to form lozenges. Bake the vol-au-vent in a hot oven for thirty minutes or more according to its size, opening the oven as little as possible. When the paste is dry and a fine color, take it out, open it by lifting up the center cover, and empty it of all the uncooked paste within, lay the vol-au-vent on to a dish, and keep it warm in the heater, not allowing the crust to get cold before using it. Small vol-au-vent crusts may be prepared the same way, using a three and a half inch pastry cutter to cut them with.  . An illustration of a Round Mold with Different Patterns Designed in the inner part. . SMALL VOL-AU-VENT CRUST IN TWO PIECES (Petites croûtes de vol-au-vent en deux pièces). Roll out with the rolling pin on a flour ed table, one pound of six turned puff paste , one quarter of an inch to three-eighths in thickness, let it rest for fifteen minutes, then cut from its surface six channeled or plain round pieces three and a half inches in diameter; as soon as this is done, remove the centers with a smooth pastry cutter two and a half inches in diameter; dipping it each time into hot water so as to make a clean cut, but it must be wiped dry before using. Cut up the clippings of paste, roll them to an eighth of an inch thick, and from this piece cut six round channeled or plain round under crusts three and a half inches in diameter, range these at regular distances on a wet baking sheet, moisten the edges of the paste with a brush, and lay on top of each one, one of the prepared rings, taking them up delicately so as not to break them, and press lightly on them to fasten the edges together; egg the surfaces of the rings, and let them rest for ten minutes, then push the baking sheet into a well heated, but moderate oven to bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes; after removing, detach them from the tin, press the center of the paste down with the finger, and keep them warm for garnishing. Small vol-au-vents may be prepared the same way making them of one piece only.  ,  . An illustration pf Small Round Pieces of Crust Cut Sharped. .

This stock is used for cooking calf 's heads, lamb trotters and also for artichoke bottoms, cardoons and oyster plants. KITCHEN UTENSILS. ROASTER AND SPITS (Rôtissoire et broches). In large kitchens the only roaster possible is the one shown in   with its broad hearth, long spits, long hanging chains and wheels: an endless chain with a weight sufficiently heavy to rotate it, steam, electricity or hydraulic pressure can to be used advantageously to attain the same end.  , represents a roasting spit for small game, quails, woodcocks, thrush, etc. It is provided with six skewers; run the game on to one of these through the two leg bones; use as much as possible the different sides for different games, for instance one side for quails, partridges or thrush and the other three skewers for snipe, woodcock, plovers, bustards, etc. These spita are very useful for large dinners, for eight quails can be put on each skewer or forty-eight quails can be roasted at once without having them too crowded. The length of the spit is sixty-eight inches and the length of each one of the six skewers is twenty inches. For cradle spit No. 116, the cut of meat to be roasted such as loin, the saddle  . An illustration of a Large Roaster with a Big Fire Place in the Back and a Metallic Structure workable by a Pulley in the Front to Hold the Meat.  ,  ,  . An illustration of a Long Metallic Rod used in Holding the Meat for Roasting, Shown from Various angles. is placed exactly in the center to regulate the weight evenly. The simple spit for poultry, game, turkey, etc. is shown in  . A spit being at times an impossibility, one is frequently obliged to have resource to the more simple roasters. The greatest objection to the old fashioned shell roaster is that the spit did not turn alone, it had to be everlastingly turned for if left the meat would certainly spoil; a great improvement on this is the turning spring spit to be wound up like a clock and strikes an alarm when slackening by the movable balls of the fan striking on a gong (  ). There are other roasters having two spoons turning at the same time as the spit feeding a small reservoir found on the top of the spit and through a shallow furrow perforated by small holes, the meat is continuously basted. The three pieces composing this oven are movable and can therefore be transported to any desirable place; the shell can easily be fastened on to the wall. There are also English spits adapted for all hearths (  ); it is easy to fasten it to a movable hearth fitting with the spit. These are run by clock work placed on top; the roasts are suspended perpendicularly and always turn in the same direction.  .

A bain-marie consists of a vessel filled with boiling water into which is placed another vessel containing the substances that are required to be heated. The materials placed in the second vessel can only acquire the temperature of the boiling water and heat gradually and progressively and therefore can be stopped at any time. Each saucepan should be ticketed with the name of the sauce it contains so that any sauce or soup can be selected without wasting time in searching for it.  . An illustration of a Rectangular Copper Case with Four High Saucepans placed inside.  . An illustration of a Small Oven attached to the Wall used in Glazing and Browning of Dishes..  .

This salamander is lighted by gas and can be fastened to the wall at the back of the range. It consists of two platforms, the upper one fixed and the lower one movable and sufficiently big to place the largest dishes on it. Naturally the gas comes from the top and it is easy to regulate its intensity by a stop cock. Two minutes suffice too obtain a perfect glazing without having the bottom of the dish attain the slightest heat, thus the sauce cannot deteriorate whatever. It is an indispensable utensil and assists the cook greatly both as regards its usefulness and speed.  .

These steam tables are heated by steam or gas, and are advantageously used either as a hot closet or as a substitute for a chafing dish. BROILER AND RANGE (Grillade et Fourneau). The broiler shown below is most useful, for on it can be cooked all meats, either using charcoal, or embers, or gas. In olden times meats were broiled on the embers of a chimney hearth, fanning continuously to keep the fire alive. For many years sliding broilers have been used and charcoal. With gas the broiling is done in a metal case, by a gas tube having the sides pierced with small holes. Although gas is very little used in kitchens still it deserves to be encouraged; for not only does this style of broiling interest amateurs by its ingenuity, but it also has its particular advantages which are manifold, as the operation takes place without the slightest trouble and without having the meats give forth any smoke or disagreable smell, for the heat attains the meat from the top and all the escaping fat falls into a receptacle   shows an improved range an explanation of which is unnecessary.  .

The French omelet pans are the best, both for shape and strength ( ).  ,  . An illustration of an Omelet Pan and a Stew pan made up of Iron and Copper Respectively. Oyster Stew Pan. -This saucepan is made of various sizes in tin with a copper bottom. It is furnished with a rounded cover perforated in the center with several small holes. The handle is very long. This saucepan is used for oysters and their liquor placed on the hot fire and when the steam escapes through the holes then remove it at once (  ). SPOONS (Cuillères).  , represents four spoons, soup or table, dessert, tea and coffee. The approximative liquid capacity is; six soup or tablespoonfuls of liquid make a gill or forty-eight a quart. Twelve dessertspoonfuls of liquid for a gill; eighteen teaspoonfuls and thirty-six coffeespoonfuls. For sugar it requires eight tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar for a pound, sixteen dessertspoonfuls, twenty-four teaspoonfuls and forty-eight coffeespoonfuls. For flour it takes ten tablespoonfuls for a pound, twenty dessertspoonfuls, thirty teaspoonfuls and sixty coffeespoonfuls.  . An illustration of of a Coffee, Tea, Dessert and Soup Spoon; compared for their liquid capacities by being placed on top of each other. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (Piods et Measures). Various ways of obtaining weights and measure. Weight by Quarts. -One quart of water weighs two pounds and four ounces; one quart of milk two pounds and an ounce and a half; cream two pounds and one ounce; oil one pound and fourteen ounces; melted butter the same weight as oil; powdered sugar one pound nine ounces; rice one pound three ounces; flour one pound two ounces; bread-crumbs eleven ounces; horseradish or cocoanut twelve ounces; wheaten grits or Indian meal fifteen ounces; oatmeal thirteen ounces; semolina one pound seven ounces. Weight by Handfuls. -A handful of sugar weighs six ounces; flour four ounces; bread-crumbs two ounces; rice three ounces; herbs, parsley, etc., one ounce. Weight by Coffeecups. -Six cupfuls of sugar weigh one pound; nine of flour one pound; eight of Indian meal, one pound; six of rice one pound. Ten black coffeecupfuls of water make one quart. Six teacupfuls of water make one quart. Four breakfast cupfuls of water make one quart. REFRIGERATOR, ICE-BOX AND COLD ROOM(Réfrigérateur, Glacière Timbre, et Chambre froide). These refrigerators are to be kept full of ice so to reduce the temperature inwardly and to avoid inconvenience arising from the excessive heat of the atmosphere. A refrigerator as shown in the accompanying design is all that is necessary for a restaurant, etc. At a third of its height are placed wooden gratings to uphold the ice, underneath is to be found a sheet of zinc or galvanized sheet iron with a small gutter, at the end, between this and the sheet of iron is a space of six inches. The bottom parts of these ice-boxes are used for keeping either beef palates,  . An illustration of an Old but Large Refrigerator, consisting of a number of Storage portions for Different Purposes. calf 's heads, sheep's trotters, croquette preparations of all kinds, etc.; each compartment should be entirely separate from one another, having a special one for fish, one for poultry, one for game, one for cold meats, one for garnishings, etc. The Ice box is simply a box of an oblong shape sufficiently thick to be filled with a non-conducting material such as charcoal, sawdust, tow, or simply an hermetically empty space not to allow the air to pass through the box; they are lined inside with galvanized sheet iron or zinc. The cold room is of a more modern invention, the meats being hung up in the inside. Cooked meats, also different provisions requiring a cold temperature of forty-five to fifty degrees Fahrenheit, such as butter, milk or cream, rest on shelves or in drawers, without being in direct contact with the ice, for it is evident that the cold air surrounding these provisions do not contain the slightest moisture that might destroy their properties. Another advantage the cold room has is that a quantity of cold entrées or sweet dishes already decorated with the jellies that are to be served will keep in perfect condition for a few days, while those placed directly on the ice do not afford the same security; however, each one has its own peculiar advantages and one must not be sacrificed for the other, on the contrary in all large kitchens each one has its own place and have both become indispensable. MEAT-SAFE (Garde-Manger). This is a kind of round or square cage composed of metallic cloth on a framework of iron or wood, provided inside with several shelves; also hanging hooks to which can be hung meats, poultry and game. On the shelves are placed all the provisions that should be exposed to the air without incurring any danger of contact with flies. These meat-safes are either suspended from the ceiling of the pantry by a pulley or else fastened to the wall outside a window; in both cases in order to have them accomplish their purpose they must be exposed to a thorough draught of air in as cool a place as possible. If the meat safe is hung in a room it can be entirely open on top, if on the contrary it is fastened outside then the upper part must certainly have a slightly inclining roof so that no rain can penetrate the inside. These meat-safes are only useful where ice is scarce for ice-boxes, are far preferable under all circumstances. CENTIMETERS AND INCHES (Centimètres et Pouces). Centimeters.  . -Inches. An illustration of a Small Scale Masuring in Centimeters on One side and in inches on the other Side.  . -Rounds. An illustration of a Series of Measurements in Rounds.  . -Circles. An illustration of a Series of Measurements in Circles Figs. 190 to 196 indicate the difference between the centimeter and the inch; the dimensions of circles, triangles, lozenges, ovals, rounds or squares all measured by the sixteenth of an inch across the diameter, or on the length for ovals and lozenges. These figures will at once give an exact idea of the proportions as they are explained in the different recipes, either for garnishings or salpicons or else for the diameter of sockets, column tubes, etc.  . -Triangles. An illustration of a Series of Measurements in Triangles.  . -Lozenges An illustration of a Series of Measurements in Lozenges.  . -Oval. An illustration of a Series of Measurements in Ovals.  . -Squares. An illustration of a Series of Measurements in Squares. BILL OF FARE HOLDER (Porte-Menu). The bill of fare is the programme of the dinner on which is found inscribed the dishes composing the meal. For ceremonious dinners the bills of fare are printed or else written on rich paper. They are laid on the table or fastened in a holder such as shown in  ; they are to be made either of silver or silver plate; if the bills of fare are printed, they are then usually laid between two guests.  . An illustration of a Bill of Fare Written on a Rich Stylish Paper carved with Beautiful Flowery Designs. COVERS FOR ROUND AND LONG DISHES (Cloches pour Plats Ronds et Longs). Those for the kitchen are made of tin and are used to cover the dishes after they are dressed, either to keep them in the hot closet or to carry to the dining-room; have always round and long ones for both large and small dishes. These require to be kept very clean and bright. SOUPS (Potages). An illustration of Two Soup Dishes and a Number of Dinner Plates Nicely arranged on the a Dinner Table. Soup is the prelude of the dinner; it is a healthy, light and stimulating food, agreeing with every one, especially children and old people. The basis of soup is broth, and therefore it is on this article that one's whole attention must be borne. There are two kinds of soup, fat and lean; they are divided into clear and thick; the garnishings for these soups are either composed of crusts, vegetables, creams of game or poultry, eggs, fish, quenelles, timbales, chiffonades, finely minced herbs, crustacean, farina ceous, etc. These two kinds of soups are divided into six chapters: First, Bisques; second, Consommé and Garnishings; third, Creams; fourth, Cosmopolitan or Mixed; fifth, Fish; sixth, Purées. Purées may be made into creams by using less butter and adding instead cream and egg-yolks, while creams can be turned into purées by suppressing the cream and egg-yolks, and stirring in, when ready to serve, a piece of fresh, fine butter. . FAT (La Graisse). Fat is insoluble in water, but melts by heat and floats on the surface of a liquid. As it is enveloped in the cells of a very fine indissoluble membrane, one part of the fat adheres always to the fibers, unless the cooking be too long and the cells are broken by the force of the boiling. Fat exists either separately in certain parts of animals, and in other parts it is interposed between the fibers; these last parts are always the most digestible and the most nourishing. Albumen (L'Albumine). -Is of the same nature as the white of egg which contains scarcely anything else than albumen; it is soluble in cold or tepid water and coagulates between one hundred and fifty to two hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit. Albumen abounds in the blood and it is found in every part of the flesh; it coagulates after being dissolved, and in broth forms what is called scum, rising to the surface of liquids in which meats are cooked. The less blood the animal has lost, the more there is albumen, and as the blood contains much osmazome, the result will be that meat having the most blood will produce a more savory soup than that which has lost a larger quantity. When a piece of either beef or mutton is needed rare, it must be plunged into boiling liquid, and being at once seized by the action of the heat, the albumen coagulates and encloses the osmazome inside. Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat for a leg of mutton weighing six to eight pounds; if boiled according to this time the meat will be found rare, unless the boiling has been too long. If on the contrary, this same piece of meat be put into cold water and is allowed to cook slowly, the albumen not coagulating at once, will let the osmazome escape into the liquid and the meats will be white and less juicy, but as nothing is lost, the broth will have gained by it in quality. Bones (Les os). -Are inorganic parts having much solidity besides being of a gelatineous nature; they contain considerable fat substance analogous to marrow, but this is but a part of their matter. Bones contain eight times more gelatin than meat. They are generally split into smaller pieces. . FIBRINE (La Fibrine). Fibrine is insoluble; it forms the base of the muscles or flesh. After meat has been very much cooked, after it has boiled a long time, the remainder of it is almost pure fibrine. Fibrine is not very nutritious, and when it has thoroughly exhausted its soluble qualities, it becomes difficult to digest. Pure fibrine has no savor, it is insipid or flavorless and becomes yellow and brittle after drying. Gelatin (La Gélatine). - Gelatin is soluble in very hot or boiling water, in tepid water it swells and dissolves only partially, and in cold water it softens without dissolving. It is colorless, insipid, inodorous and is susceptible to pass rapidly into a state of acetic fermentation. There is very little nutrition in gelatin; when in sufficient quantity it gives the broth the peculiar quality of forming into a jelly when cold. Gelatin exists in all parts of the meat, but more profusely in gristle and bone. In a pure state it is insipid. Osmazome (L'Osmazôme). -Soluble even when cold, this is a part of the flesh of the beef, of the brain and of certain mushrooms. It is osmazome which gives to the broth its savor, its aroma and its sapidity. It is supplied with an exceedingly stimulating property, exciting the appetite and helping considerably to facilitate digestion; it seems to exist only in the flesh and blood, and more abundantly in old cattle and in dark meats, than in young animals and white meat. The properties of osmazome are more perceptible when the meats are broiled or roasted; then the sapidity is stronger and the aroma more exhilarating. Poultry gives very little sapidity to broths unless they be old and very fat, for their grease has a more pronounced flavor than that found in quadrupeds. Gristle, fat and bones are entirely free of osmazome; in broths there is one part osmazome to seven parts gelatin. . CARE TO BE TAKEN WHILE PREPARING BROTH (Des Soins à Prendre pour Préparer le Bouillon). First. -Select the freshest meats procurable; do not wash, but remove all that is not of the very freshest; bone and tie up each piece separately leaving them as large as possible; split the bones and put them into a soup-pot with cold water and the meat. Second. -Heat and boil it up slowly to give the albumen time to dissolve in the liquid; it coagulates so soon as the liquid reaches one hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit, and rising to the surface brings with it all the impurities contained therein, which is called scum. Third. -Carefully remove this scum as quickly as it rises to the surface, and before the liquid boils, for after that the scum partly dissolves and the rest of it precipitates and destroys the transparency of the broth. When the broth is well skimmed, add salt, allspice, and vegetables; then keep it boiling as continuously and slowly as possible to prevent too much evaporation. . CLEAR BOUILLON (Bouillon Clair). There is nothing that resembles consommé more than clarified bouillon, and if it does not entirely take its place as regards quality, still it is often used instead. Clarified bouillon is in reality only an imitation of consommé, it is equally true that with care it can easily be prepared in excellent conditions, the principal one being to operate with good bouillon, either of chicken, beef or game, etc. To obtain clear bouillon, only lean meats must be used for clarification; in order to obtain four quarts of bouillon, have one pound of lean beef free of all fat and nerves, chop it finely, and mix in with it, two raw eggs and one pint of cold bouillon; place the strained bouillon on the fire, skimmed free of all its fat, and when it reaches boiling point, pour into it the clarification, beating it well with a whip. As soon as the bouillon boils, keep it to the same degree of heat without allowing it to boil, for one hour; skim the fat off, season with salt and a little sugar, and color it with caramel , then remove and strain through a wet napkin stretched and fastened to the four legs of a kitchen stool (  ), or else a silk sieve. These bouillons are to be served with garnishings of Italian pastes and farina s, also garnishings of vegetables, etc., for various soups. . WHITE CHICKEN BOUILLON OR BROTH (Bouillon Blanc de Volaille). Have ten quarts of water in a soup pot; add to it three pounds of knuckle of veal, and trimmings, seven pounds of very fresh poultry. Boil, skim, and put in three quarters of a pound of carrots, half a pound of turnips, twelve ounces of leeks, two onions, one stuck with two cloves, two ounces of celery, one ounce of parsley roots, two bay leaves, salt, sixty grains of whole peppers; boil slowly and continuously for four hours, then strain through a silk sieve. If needed in a great hurry, boil six quarts of ordinary stock, have two fowls of three pounds each, after removing the breasts, chop the remainder of the fowls coarsely, put them in the stock, add four ounces of minced carrots and six ounces of leeks also minced, boil slowly for one hour; skim off the fat, season with salt, strain through a fine sieve or moistened napkin, and serve. The breasts are used for forcemeat or to clarify broth. . CLARIFIED CONSOMMÉ AND REMOISTENING. (Consommé Clarifié et Remouillage). Proportions. -When the stock is ready put five quarts of it into a soup pot, adding two pounds of lean meat and three pounds of cleansed and washed fowls. Boil it up slowly, and just when ready to come to a boil, carefully remove the scum arising on the surface and then add half a pound of roasted veal. Simmer slowly until the fowl is cooked, which will take from two and a half to three hours, lifting it out as soon as it is done so as to save the breasts which will be found useful for garnishings, purées, salads, sandwiches, etc.; return what remains of the fowls to the broth once again and continue boiling for half an hour longer, skim the fat off very carefully and mix in the clarification. Clarification. -Trim off the fat, remove the nerves from a piece of beef sufficient to obtain two pounds after it is chopped up, and mix in with this chopped meat half a quart of cold stock (or water ); pour this clarification into the broth, add two ounces of minced carrots, and two ounces of minced leeks; season with salt and color the soup with caramel ; keep the liquid in a boiling state for one hour. The consommé should be perfectly clear, sapid and tasty: strain it through a silk sieve or a fine napkin and use when needed, serve in cups, or in a soup tureen with any garnishing desired. Remoistening. -After the stock or consommé has been taken out of the pot, pour in sufficient water to have the meats entirely re-covered and boil again for three hours; remove all the fat and strain it through a napkin; do not salt this. This remoistening is used for diluting certain soups, and to moisten veal or chicken stock with which meat extract is made (see meat extract, No. 368) . . CLARIFIED CHICKEN CONSOMÉ, (Consommé de Volaille Clarifié). Put into a soup pot eight quarts of white chicken broth , add two pounds of knuckle of veal, one pound of chicken legs and pinions, then boil, skim, and put in four pounds of roasted, unbrowned chicken, two minced leeks, one medium sized minced carrot, one onion stuck with one clove, a little parsley and celery roots. Boil continually for four hours. Chop up very fine two pounds of veal, mix in with it two whole eggs, dilute with one quart of cold broth and stir this into the consommé, using a whip, adding two broken up chicken carcasses. Boil on a slow fire for one hour, salt it according to taste, and strain it through a silk sieve. . CLARIFIED FISH CONSOMMÉ, (Consommé de Poisson Clarifié). Butter the bottom of a saucepan, garnishing it with sliced onions, and place on top six pounds of fish bones, such as bass, perch or any other gelatinous fish, a bunch of celery, parsley, bay leaf, thyme, one pound of minced carrots, a pound and a half of leeks, and dilute with one quart of water. Cover the saucepan, set it over a slow fire, and let fall to a colorless glaze, then moisten with four quarts of hot water, boil, skim and let simmer for one hour, then strain through a sieve, and clarify the broth with the whites of four eggs and half a bottleful of white wine. . CLARIFIED GAME CONSOMMÉ (Consommé Brun de Gibier Clarifié). Butter the inside of a very thick saucepan, cover the bottom with sliced onions, and lay on top three pounds of broken knuckle of veal and eight pounds of game, such as partridges, quails, pheasants and young rabbit, also half a pound of legs and pinions or bits of poultry, moisten with a pint of stock, place it on a moderate fire, and cover the saucepan; let steam and fall to a glaze, then dilute with half bottle of white wine, and ten quarts of stock or water. Boil, then skim and season with salt and two pepper corns for each quart of liquid, two cloves, also half a pound of carrots, one ounce of parsley roots, half a pound of leeks, two ounces of celery, the whole minced. Remove all the bones from two very fresh young rabbits; put these in with the stock and boil all for four hours; strain through a sieve and put it back into the saucepan; chop up fine the flesh from the rabbits with as much lean beef meat, mix in with it two whole eggs and dilute with half a bottleful of white wine. Skim off all the fat from the broth and stir in the chopped rabbits, continuing stirring for one minute, then let come to a boil, move it from the hot fire, and boil slowly and unceasingly for one half hour more; after the consommé is very clear, strain it through a silk sieve or through a napkin. . CLARIFIED LENT VEGETABLE CONSOMMÉ (Consommé maigre de Légumes Clarifié). Mince about three pounds of carrots and three pounds of turnips, one pound of the white of celery, one pound of onions, half a pound of parsley roots, a quarter of a pound of parsnips and a pound and a half of leeks. Put half a pound of butter into a saucepan, warm it and fry the vegetables, then moisten with two quarts of water and reduce slowly until they fall into a glaze. Dilute it with ten quarts of water, season with salt, pepper, half an ounce of sugar and cloves, adding one pound of mushroom stalks, then boil slowly until the vegetables are well done without mashing, and strain through a sieve. Return it to the fire and clarify the broth with the whites of four eggs and half a bottle of white wine. After it is very clear, strain it through a silk sieve or a napkin. (194a). BEEF STOCK OR BROTH (Grand Bouillon de Bœuf). Proportion of Ingredients. -Ten quarts of water, a quarter of a pound of chicken legs, one and one quarter ounces of salt, six ounces of leeks, half ounce of soup celery, eight pounds of meat with bone, twenty grains or cloves of black pepper, six ounces of carrots, one half ounce of parsnip, one half clove of garlic (if desired), two whole cloves, three ounces turnips, four ounces of onions, one of which stuck with two cloves. Put ten quarts of water into a stockpot, add eight pounds of beef meat (trimmings and bone ), let there be at least two-thirds meat, being careful to have both meat and trimmings well freed of fat; and a quarter of a pound of scalded chicken legs, after removing the outer skin. Heat this up slowly so that it comes gradually to a boil, then skim carefully and add twenty grains of whole black peppers and one and one quarter ounces of salt. Put into a net six ounces of carrots, three ounces of turnips, six ounces of leeks, half an ounce of parsnips, one half an ounce of soup celery, and two ounces of onions in which two cloves should be stuck. Close the net and set it in the pot; after the vegetables have cooked for two hours, remove the net containing the vegetables and continue boiling the soup for two hours longer, making four hours in all. Take off all the fat from the surface and strain the soup either through a silk tammy or a napkin; pour it into another pot to make consommé; and in case it should be needed the following day only, pour it into vessels and set it to cool; the following is an economical way of doing so: set the vessels in a water reservoir supplied continually with cold water from melting ice in the refrigerators and brought through a pipe in the bottom of the tank, have a larger overflow pipe placed near the top so as to allow the water as it heats to flow off. (194b). PARTS OF BEEF USED FOR PREPARING BOUILLONS AND STOCKS, SEE   (Parties du Bœuf Servant à Faire les Bouillons et les Fonds, Voir  ). These various pieces are No. 2, the cheek jowl; No. 3, the neck; No. 4, the brisket; No. 5, the cross- ribs; No. 6, the shin; No. 8, the plate; No. 9, the navel; No. 10, the inside flank; No. 11, the thick flank; No. 17, the round bottom; No. 18, the leg. The shin is the bottom part of the hind quarter the nearest to the ankle bone. The gelatinous flesh of the shin renders it suitable for the preparation of stock, broths and jellies. . GAME, VEGETABLE, FISH AND CHICKEN STOCK, FOR THICK SOUPS (Fonds de Gibier, Légumes, Poisson et Volaille pour Potages Lies). In order to make thick stock use consommé of game, vegetables, fish or chicken before they are clarified. Place half a pound of butter in a saucepan with half a pound of sifted flour of the best quality, let cook well on a slow fire without coloring when needed for vegetables, fish or chicken, but for game make a brown roux; for either one or the other dilute this roux with boiling broth (if the soup should be a chicken soup, chicken broth should be used to dilute the roux, if game soup then game broth should be used, fish with fish broth, for vegetable, vegetable broth ). Use a whisk turning it rapidly, so as to avoid having lumps; stocks for soups should be kept rather thin, that is to say but little thickened and should be well despumated, the fat removed before passing through the tammy; return the saucepan to the fire, and stir continuously with a spatula from the bottom until the broth boils. Remove the saucepan and place it so that only one side of the contents cook slowly for one hour; skim and take off all the matter that swims on the surface until the stock be entirely free from fat, and other impurities floating on top arising from the clarification, then strain through a tammy or fine sieve, and use this stock for thick soups either of game, vegetables, fish or poultry. . BISQUES (Bisques). An exquisite and delicious bisque. The ancient bisques made between the years 1700 to 1750, differed greatly from our modern bisques. They were more like stews than soups or potages and were prepared with squabs, quails, pullets and fish, the crawfish only serving as a garnish, and were basted over with a crawfish gravy. Bisques as they are made to-day, are simply a purée, thickened with rice, or thick stock, or wet crusts and accompanied by various garnishings. Bisques are divided into five classes: First, those made of clams, oysters or mussels; Second, crabs; Third, shrimps, Fourth, crawfish; Fifth, lobsters. They must be highly seasoned, although not containing much red pepper, rather clear than thick, slightly colored, and accompanied by small, simple garnishings. . BISQUE OR PURÉE OF CLAMS À LA HENDRICK (Bisque ou Purée de Lucines à la Hendrick). Put sixty medium-sized opened clams into a pan, with their own juice; set it on the fire, and when they are very firm to the touch drain and pound the clams with their equal weight of cooked hominy; after all is well pounded and reduced to a paste, wet it with the clam juice poured off gently from the top, and some water in case the bisque be too thick, then pass it through a sieve or tammy and season with red pepper and very little salt if necessary, warm the bisque without boiling it, and just when ready to serve incorporate therein some fine butter and a little cream, garnish with sippets of bread fried in butter and some small pike quenelles . . BISQUE OF CRABS (Bisque de Crabes). Put twenty-four live crabs in cold water with a little salt, and leave them to soak for one hour, mince four ounces of carrot and the same quantity of onion, fry them in butter in a saucepan sufficiently large to contain all the crabs, add some parsley sprigs, thyme and bay leaf, season with salt, half a bottle of white wine and some white stock, then cover and cook for fifteen minutes; lift out the crabs, strain the broth, and set it aside to rest, pouring off the top twenty-five minutes later. Remove the shells from the crabs; pick out the lungs from both sides, wash each one separately in tepid water and suppress the small legs, then drain well and pound them to a paste with half their quantity of cooked rice, dilute this purée with some of the juice they were cooked in, drain through a sieve and then a tammy and mix in one pint of bechamel . Season with salt and red pepper, heat up without boiling and just when ready to serve, incorporate therein a quarter of a pound of fine butter, stirring it well with a spoon until it be completely melted. Pour the very hot bisque into a soup tureen and serve separately a garnishing of pieces of bread cut into one quarter of an inch squares and fried in butter; divide them by putting six or eight in each separate soup-plate when serving. . BISQUE OF CRABS À LA STEVENS (Bisque de Crabes à la Stevens). Wash twenty-four live crabs in several waters; then drain them, fry half a pound minced onions in butter, adding a quarter of a pound of rice flour and then the crabs; moisten with half a bottleful of white wine and two quarts of broth; cook slowly in a covered saucepan for fifteen minutes, then lift out the crabs only, and strain the broth into another vessel, and leave it to deposit its sediment. Remove the large shells from the crabs, also the small legs and lungs, then wash the crabs well in warm water, moving them around in the pan so as to free them of all adhering sand; after draining them well, pound them in a mortar with the addition of a little butter; moisten them with the decanted stock and some other broth, should it be too thick; strain through a sieve or tammy, and return them to the saucepan. Heat to a boiling degree without actually letting it boil, warm it, then add some egg-yolks, cream and fine butter; strain again through a tammy and serve the soup very hot with crusts of bread cut dice shaped, a quarter of an inch in size. . BISQUE OF CRABS, ORIENTAL (Bisque de Crabes à l'Orientale). Prepare and cook the crabs the same as for bisque of crabs have one pound of onions, cut them in halves through the center of the root and stalk, remove from each side of the halved onion, and on the bias, one quarter of an inch of the root and stalk; mince this up very fine, blanch, then drain and fry the pieces in butter, moistening them with one part of cream. Pound well the crabs to reduce them to a paste and add six quarts of oatmeal previously cooked for thirty minutes in one quart of water. Add the onions, and when all is well mingled together, increase the quantity of bisque with the decanted crab juice and more broth, if the purée be too thick; strain through a sieve or tammy, return it to the fire, and heat it without boiling, and just when ready to serve, stir in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Pour the soup into a very hot soup tureen and add a garnishing of crescent shaped quenelles, made of sweet potatoes . . BISQUE OF CRAWFISH (Bisque d'Écrevisses). Wash in several waters four dozen crawfish after removing the fins, the same as for bisque Persigny ; put the crawfish into a saucepan, pouring over half a bottleful of white wine, four ounces of minced onions, the same quantity of finely minced carrots, a few sprigs of parsley, one bay leaf, as much thyme, salt, mignonette, a little red pepper and half a pint of broth; cook all together for ten minutes with the cover on, tossing them several times in the meanwhile, then take them from off the fire and leave them standing for ten minutes longer in their broth; pour them into a colander to drain, and afterward select half of the finest, medium and equal sized ones; remove the tail ends from these, and the shells, and keep the meats aside for the garnishing, also half of the finest, but smallest shells from the head; stuff these with a red pike forcemeat finished with crawfish butter (for this see crawfish butter, No. 573 ), and with the remainder of the crawfish and the fragments make a bisque, pounding them with their equal quantity of rice; when all is well pounded, moisten with the broth they were cooked in and more plain broth, then strain through a sieve and a tammy. Warm it well without boiling, and incorporate into it when ready to serve, a piece of crawfish butter; pour the soup into the tureen and garnish with the tails and bodies both cut lengthwise in two. Crawfish bisque should be colored slightly more than the shrimp bisque. Use for coloring bisques some orchanet warmed in clarified butter or any other greasy substance, or clear vegetal carmine. Breton makes an excellent coloring for bisques. . BISQUE OF CRAWFISH À LA BATELIERE (Bisque d Écrevisses à la Batelière). After removing the fins from the middle of the tails as for à la Persigny , wash forty-eight crawfish in several waters, drain them, mince some carrots, leeks, onions and celery root, fry them in butter and just on the eve of browning, mix in a quarter of a pound of flour; cook the flour for a few minutes, and then add the crawfish, some sprigs of parsley, two bay leaves, salt and mignonette, cover the saucepan and cook for fifteen minutes, tossing them several times, then drain. Pick out the meat from the tails, cut them in two and reserve them for the garnishing: pound the shells as well as the claws with twelve hard boiled egg-yolks, and when a good paste is obtained, moisten it with the thick stock, strained first through a sieve not too fine, and afterward through a tammy; moisten again with fat or lean broth. Should the bisque be required for a lean dinner; warm it up without boiling and incorporate in half a pound of crawfish butter with cayenne and half a gill of Madeira wine. Set the crawfish tails into a soup tureen and pour the bisque over, and when serving the soup put into each plate six pieces of bread a quarter of an inch square, fried in butter. . BISQUE OF CRAWFISH À LA HUMBOLDT (Bisque d'Écrevisses à la Humbo ldt). Wash thoroughly in several waters, four dozen crawfish, after removing the fins from the middle of the tail (see bisque Persigny, No. 204 ), drain them, then fry in butter, some carrots, onions, leeks, celery and parsley roots all cut into small squares; moisten with half a bottleful of Rhine wine, the same quantity of broth, and season with salt, mignonette and cayenne, and a gill of tomato purée , put this with the crawfish on the fire in a well covered saucepan and cook for fifteen minutes, tossing them frequently while cooking; then drain them, and pick out the meat from the tails. Pound the shells with double their quantity of rice and when all forms a paste, moisten with the broth strained through a fine sieve; season and warm up without boiling, and when ready to serve, mix in a quarter of a pound of crawfish butter. Place the crawfish tails with small pancakes, cut round, five-eighths of an inch in diameter, in the soup tureen and pour the bisque over. .

TIMBALES, REMARKS ON (Observations sur les Timbales). There are several kinds of timbales; those made with a very thin timbale paste; those of quenelle forcemeat and those of cream forcemeat, either of chicken, game or fish. The name timbale should only be applied to those made of paste cylindrical-shaped like a footless goblet, or a silver mug, or else half spherical-shaped in imitation of the kettle- drum used in an orchestra and filled with a garnishing of some kind. A "bung" would better represent the idea of what is commonly called timbale, and I would suggest the adoption of the French of bung "bondon," for I scarcely believe that the elegance of the bill of fare would be marred by reading: "Bondons of Pickerel à la Walton," or "Bondons of Chicken à la Reine," or "Bondons of Woodcock à la Diane," or "Bondons of Pheasants à la Benois." I have not the slightest intention of changing the conventional name. I only suggest an idea that might be advantageously followed if so desired. For making timbales cylindrical molds two and five-eighths inches wide by two and one-eighth inches high are generally used; butter the insides with fresh unmelted butter and decorate with fanciful cuts of truffles, tongue, pistachios, etc. They may also be strewn with truffles, tongue, lobster coral and pistachios, all these being chopped up finely and separately, then dried in the air. Fill with forcemeat either with or without a salpicon, then poach; for this consult Elementary Methods . Invert on to a dish containing a little consommé and serve the sauce that accompanies the timbales separately. . TIMBALES À LA BEAUMARCHAIS (Timbales à la Beaumarchais).

Diamond-back or salt water terrapin are found all along the Atlantic coast, but more especially in the Chesapeake bay and its tributaries; other salt water species from Massachusetts to Texas are quite numerous, and as a substitute for those of the Chesapeake are extensively used by houses of ordinary reputation. The scarcity of Chesapeake diamond-back terrapin grows more apparent each year, and even now it frequently requires many days of laborious and tedious work and many miles of walking over soft boggy marshes, of prodding in deep narrow channels with long shafted tongs by men skilled and familiar with all their cunnings habits before one is taken from a hiding place, just below the surface, sufficiently deep for protection against the winter frosts. The favorite place for the hibernation of the very largest size is a few inches below the soft oozy mud at the bed of a three or four fathom V-shaped channel in the bed of a creek of about the same distance from shore to shore. Thousands of such creeks penetrate the shores and islands of the Chesapeake, and those less frequented by man are instinctively selected by the terrapin for its haunts. At least ninety per cent. of those taken from the beds of deep creeks will measure six and one-half to eight and one-half inches with an average weight of nearly two and three-fourths pounds, are females; while eighty per cent. of those bedded in the marshes have an average weight of three-fourths of a pound and measure less than five inches. The males invariably bed in the marshes and among the rushes of very shallow ponds, only venturing in cold water during the summer and the warmest spring and fall months, in which time they lead a migratory life in search of food, consisting principally of small shell fish and the soft-shell crabs. About ninety-eight per cent. of the male terrapin never exceed five inches in length on the bottom shell, while the female has been known to measure nine inches and weigh seven and one-half pounds. In the month of December, 1885, Delmonico received from Baltimore a Chesapeake Maryland terrapin measuring eight and three-fourths inches, weighing nine and one-half pounds and containing fifty-six eggs; this must be accepted as one of the finest specimens ever found of the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin. The standard length for those who buy and sell terrapin is six inches; when of this dimension they are called "counts." Both the male and female are very shy and active, swim well and run (though awkwardly) with considerable speed. Prior to about 1870 the salt and brackish waters of the bay literally teemed with this now nearly exterminated and hence valuable reptile; they could be taken by the dozen at a single haul of a long net, but the market value was so small as to render them almost worthless except for local use, and in consequence thousands of large egg terrapin were fed away to swine or cooked for fattening fowls. The people, thoughtless and unprincipled, have robbed themselves by trapping incalculable quantities of terrapin before they had matured sufficeinty for breeding and by digging eggs from beneath the sand shores where they had been deposited by the females to hatch. While the laws enacted by the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia for their protection differ somewhat they are both excellent, and had they been rigidly enforced this spectacle of ultimate extermination would not exist. The time for hibernation usually lasts about six months, beginning with approaching frosty weather in the fall and continuing till the warm spring weather; they bury a few inches deep in the mud and leave, at the spot where they disappear, a mound in the middle of which a hole can be discerned. It is this mound and its hole which first attracts the attention of the fisherman; during this period an enormous quantity of terrapn are caught in their torpid state. They take no nourishment whatever while in this condition. They hatch their young toward the end of June and the beginning of July. The terrapin season is from the month of November to May; they are at their best during December, January, February and March. Very often terrapin are sent to market in October and November, also penned terrapin of the year before.  . An illustration of a Large Terrapin. Penned Terrapin . -Are those caught beforehand and kept in an enclosed place; they are fed on oysters, crabs or fish; these terrapin are never so good as those freshly caught. The small species of terrapin are divided into two classes; heifers, the under shell of these never measuring more than five inches in length, and bulls five to five and a half. Terrapin begin to hatch their eggs at the age of four years; while growing their shell lengthens one inch every year, so their age may be approximately judged by their length, for example; a six-inch terrapin is supposed to be six years old.

An illustration of an Instrument with a Scale Printed on One Side and a Handle on the Other Side. The prices quoted above are the actual prices of terrapins in New York, Baltimore and Crisfield, and are liable to fluctuate according to the market supply; this can be overcome by diminishing or augmenting the price per pound. The letters in the four divisions of the table No. 1, refer to sizes of the terrapins. A. denotes terrapins from five to six inches; B. from six to seven, etc. To make use of these tables: Weigh the terrapins and barrel as received, deduct weight of barrel, grass, etc., which will leave the net weight. Sort the terrapins by sizes in differences of a quarter of an inch, using the measure shown in  . Weigh the terrapins of each size by ounces, then find the average weight of each, refer to table No. 2, looking in the first column for the corresponding length, then find in what column their average weight in ounces is found; in this same section will be found their price by the pound; for instance: a seven and three-quarter inch terrapin weighing 64 ounces at $2.05 cents a pound will cost $8.20, or one dozen will cost $98.40.

To Select Terrapin . -To buy terrapin See Schedules or Tables Nos. 1 and 2. When buying terrapin be careful to observe that the extreme tip or muzzle of the head is not injured, that the bottom of the feet are not worn off, that the head is prettily shaped, small thin and pointed, the eyes brilliant and the feet small and slender. The superiority of their race is made apparent by their fine appearance. There is no doubt that the diamond-back Chesapeake bay terrapin are far better than any other kind found in the markets. Their price is very high, they being sold on an average of the five to six inch ones or over at a $1.25 a pound or $15.00 to $17.00 a dozen; the six to seven inch ones bring $1.50 a pound or $35.00 to $40.00 a dozen; the seven to eight inch ones bring $1.75 a pound or $55.00 to $60.00 a dozen; the eight to nine inches bring $1.90 a pound or $80.00 to $85.00 a dozen. They should be procured before the extreme cold weather sets in to avoid freezing during the trip, for once frost bitten they die easily. To Keep the Terrapin . -In order to keep them properly they must be left in a cold place forty to forty-five degrees Fahrenheit; it should also be clean, well aired, dark and better be too damp than too dry. They must be placed in large or small boxes according to the quantity; range the terrapin in the boxes, pressing them down one beside the other so that they cannot possibly move, and between each bed lay damp sea grass. When packed like this they may be kept for several months. Examine the terrapin now and then. Should there be any dead ones take them out. They must be handled with care, laid one next to the other, not thrown, as they are very tender and delicate and are liable to die easily, incurring a heavy loss, as a dead terrapin is a ruined one and ought to be thrown away at once. No eggs are found in terrapin of less than six inches long. . TO PREPARE AND COOK TERRAPIN (Pour Préparer et Cuire La Terrapène). Drop the terrapin in sufficient tepid water to allow it to swim, and leave them thus for half an hour, then change the water several times and wash them well. Scald, by plunging them into boiling water, and take out as quickly as the skin (a small white skin on the head and feet ) can be removed with a cloth, put them on to cook in water without any salt or seasoning, or else in a steam vessel leaving them for thirty to forty-five minutes, and lift them out as quickly as they are done. In order to be sure of this, press the feet meat between the fingers, and if it yields easily under the pressure, they are ready. Those that cannot be cooked in forty-five minutes are considered of an inferior quality, and those that are not done after one hour (unless they are very large), should be rejected as worthless, for although the meat may eventually become tender, it will be stringy and not have the same delicate taste of a good terrapin. Let them get cold, cut off the nails, then break the shell on the flat side, on both sides near the upper or top one; detach this shell from the meats, empty out all the insides found in this upper shell, suppressing the entrails and lights, and carefully removing the gall bladder from the liver, being very particular not to break it, also cutting away with the tip of a small knife any gall spots to be found thereon, then place the liver in cold water. Remove the white inside muscles, as well as the head and tail; separate the legs at their joints and divide into an inch and a quarter pieces; do not break the bones, the lights, entrails, head, tail, claws, heart, muscles and gall bladder to be thrown away. Lay the terrapin in a saucepan with the eggs and liver cut in thin slices, season with salt, black pepper and cayenne, and cover with sufficient water to attain to the heighth of the terrapin, then let boil and finish the cooking in a slow oven for twenty to thirty minutes; the terrapin is now ready to be used, and can easily be finished by following the recipes found later on. Should it only be required for the next day, place in tin molds or else small China pots, the proportions being at the inside bottom two and three-eighths inches, on top, three inches in diameter, and two and three-eighth inches high. Allow four or six eggs to each, fill them up with terrapin, about six ounces for each, and finish filling with the broth; each mold will contain one portion. When unmolded each one should weigh seven ounces. This quantity will be sufficient for two or three persons for a dinner and for five persons for a buffet. . TERRAPIN À LA BALTIMORE (Terrapène à la Baltimore). Have one quart of prepared terrapin as explained in No. 1082 ; drain it off. Cook four ounces of butter in a saucepan till it becomes hazelnut buter , but watch carefully that it does not blacken; add to it the terrapin with some salt, freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of cayenne, fry for few moments, then moisten with the broth. Dilute one tablespoonful of fecula, arrowroot or cornstarch in a little cold water, pour it in with the terrapin, toss well to thicken nicely, and just when ready to serve add half a gill of good sherry wine. After the terrapin has been prepared it is served in chafing dishes kept warm by water boiling continuously by means of an alcohol lamp, or else in small silver plated saucepans (  ) or in China terrapins (  ), the backs of which are loose and are used as covers; whichever way may be chosen, be most particular that the terrapin is always served very hot.  ,  .

Ingredients. - Pork bowels, calf 's crow, throat fat taken from the pig, salt, pepper, allspice, nutmeg, onion, shallot, mignonette and parsley. Take some pork bowels, removing the stomach and the casing, only using the large intestine, wash this in cold water. Turn it inside out in such a way that the fatty part is inside; in order to accomplish this easily, take a stick a yard long, place the end of it in three inches of the narrowest end of the pipe and run the pipe entirely on the stick, keeping it all the time in its original place; when it is all on let slide by pulling it slowly on the first part, that is on the stick, and the pipe will turn over all alone. Now clean it in luke- warm water acidulated with vinegar, changing it three times and leave to soak for three hours; rub it once more through the hands so as to remove all the remaining gluey parts. Put aside the uncrimped part of the pipe which will answer for wrapping purposes and set the remainder in a pot full of cold water; heat until the pipe becomes a little hard, not letting it boil. Afterward cut the pipe lengthwise, lay it perfectly flat spread it out and clean it thoroughly; cut it into thin strips as long as possible without separating the parts. Cut also into the same lengths the crimped part of a calf 's crow suppressing the fat center. Cut up about a pound and a half of salt pork into strips. Now lay all these out on a table in the proportion of two-thirds of the bowels and the other third composed of crow and throat fat; dress in oblong shape, being careful that the left side has the least possible loose ends; the size to be about eight to nine strips. Season this laid out part with a minced seasoning composed of three onions, three shallots, half a handful of very finely chopped parsley, pepper, allspice, nutmeg and mignonette, strewing it over the whole. Pass a strap made of two six inch lengths of birchwood fastened together with an inch length of string through the opening on the left end, and turn it in such a way that the chitterling has the appearance of a twisted cable. Cut the pipes laid aside for wrapping purposes into sixteen inch lengths, have the fatty part outside, operating the same as when turning over the gut itself, placing the gut one inch below the hole; run the chitterling through, being careful to keep the first end at the extremity of the chitterling; tie both ends. Although this may appear very easy, yet it is a difficult operation to perform for the first time and requires a certain practice. To Cook the Chitterlings. -To have them very white, cook in a stock of half milk, half water, one onion, thyme, bay leaf, salt and lemon; leave to boil slowly for about three hours. In order to give a finer appearance, restuff the chitterling after the first cooking in an uncrimped pipe and leave on a slow fire for fifteen minutes, keeping it near boiling point. Now lay it in a napkin and press between two boards with weights on top or else in the press (  ); the chitterlings will be square-shaped.
