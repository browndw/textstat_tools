The house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP.

Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the hallway. A door open.

CLOSE-UP. FERRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA. His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties. Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed for work.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ferris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

CLOSE-UP. FERRIS

His lifeless eyes blink.

INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS

Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, Ferris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom takes one of Ferris' hands.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(discreetly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should you call the doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't want me to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you want Mom to call the doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can manage is a choked gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris tries again.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(raspy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to get up. Joyce gently pushes him back down.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to school like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should call the office and tell them I won't be in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes. His older sister, JEANIE, walks into the room. She's dressed for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't feel well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right. Dry that one out and you can fertilize the lawn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough, Jeanie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JEANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not falling for this, are you? Tell me you're not falling for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEANIE>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Jeanie? I can't see that far. Jeanie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<JEANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pucker up and squat, Ferris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEANIE>
<JOYCE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<JEANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(angry, defeated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really letting him stay home? I can't believe this. If I was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school. It's so unfair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEANIE>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie. Be thankful that you're fit and have your health. Cherish it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<JEANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I wanna puke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEANIE>
<DIRECTION>
She glares at Ferris. Her eyes are mascara and vengence. She slips out of the room. Ferris' brother, TODD and sister, KIMBERLY peek into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Myocardial infarction?

<JOYCE>

	Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right down.

	Syphilitic meningitus? That would be a huge family embarrassment.

	Get downstairs!

</TOM>

Todd backs out of the room.

<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be okay. I'll just sleep. Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.

(to Ferris)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm showing houses to the family from California today but I'll be in the area. My office'll know where I am, if you need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll check it with you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice to know I have such loving, caring parents. You're both very special people.

CU. FERRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM. JOYCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She strokes Ferris' hair.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you feel better, pumpkin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
She leans down and kisses his forehead. Tom pats his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
CU. FERRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris lets out a wheeze. His glassy eyes follow his parents to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We love you, sweetie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call if you need us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They close the door. The lock clicks. Ferris' eyes shift from the door to CAMERA. A sly, little smile crawls across his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They bought it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The MTV theme music ROARS IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU. TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TV at the foot of Ferris' bed. The MTV logo is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris yanks open the drapes. The pall of the sickroom disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible! One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks out the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a beautiful day!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV broadcast. A NEW SONG begins.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He equalizes the sound a little.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He exits into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's debris. He turns on the shower water.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops up.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see Ferris' outline.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I care about it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up. It's moulded into a fin with shampoo.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY. LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different color.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I condone fascism. Or and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an "ism". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He passes CAMERA and goes into his room.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps his fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and puts it on. He drops the towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail. I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here. I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped. But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point. I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong. There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying. He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit? My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his speech as he disrobes.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely different outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the pantry.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAMILY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over and picks up the telephone. He sets it in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart, he looks at someone like me and thinks, "This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
CU. PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He punches out a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He remote controls the TV on.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleek, modern house on a couple of deeply wooded acres. A prime house in a prime location. A telephone rings OVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a dark, dreary sick room. Shades drawn, floor strewn with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON FRYE, is laying in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY is playing. He's mumbling random words.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Food...shelter...no...yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. His hand reaches back and hits the speaker phone button.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
(weak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

</CAMERON>
<FERRIS_VOICE>

</FERRIS_VOICE>
<CAMERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very little.

</CAMERON>
<FERRIS_VOICE>

He disconnects and gets his father back. He switches back to his sick voice.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Dad. The moment before you called, I had a chest spasm and I blew lung fluid all over the place. It was making me ill looking at it. But gee, it's sure great of you to call. I'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager.

	Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back.

He takes out the magazine. He leafs through the pages for the pictorials as he speaks.

	Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision. The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything.

Along the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to CAMERA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic. I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance. You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark ballad sign-off.

After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault. I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird. I'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because I'm not allowed to smoke at home, that I got in the driver's ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and I realized what the hell I was doing and I went to put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway, I was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that I considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost too much. I took it again and passed. But I had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?

	This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day. We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work. And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it.

</SLOANE>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Sloane smiles knowingly.

Ferris sprints across a backyard. He jumps a plaster elf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER BACKYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris vaults a fence. He runs directly for a swimming pool. He's approaching it from the side. He leaps, hits the diving board, springs off, does a flip and lands on the grass on the other side of the pool.

<DIRECTION>
Ferris tries the door. It's locked. He reaches down and lifts the doormat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU. PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The outline of a key in the dirt under the mat. The key's gone. The toe of a chewed-up dress shoe steps INTO FRAME. An OMNIOUS CHORD IS STRUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU. FERRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares up in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROONEY>

Ferris is caught. There's no way out. Rooney gloats severely.
</DIRECTION>
<ROONEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does another year of high school sit with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROONEY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the backdoor opens. Jeanie looks out. She feigns joy and relief. She rushes Ferris and hugs him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God, you're alright! We've been worried sick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEANIE>
<DIRECTION>
CU. FERRIS

<DIRECTION>
A moment of curiosity. Then it dawns on him what's happening. He smiles.

She raises her hands and strikes a karate pose. A huge smile passes over her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU. ROONEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look of terror as he realizes that is was Jeanie who kicked him and that Jeanie knows it was he who she kicked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeanie steps into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARD. CU. DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The click of the door wakes him up. His head pops up off the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU. ROONEY
</DIRECTION>

He senses new danger. We hear AN O.C. GROWL. Rooney squeezes his eyes shut.
</DIRECTION>

Ferris walks into the room, brushes the crumbs off his hands and peels off his shirt. He climbs into bed. No sooner are the covers over him than the bedroom door opens and Joyce and Tom walk in. They walk over to the bed. Joyce sits down.
