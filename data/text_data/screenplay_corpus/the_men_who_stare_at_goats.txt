...CLOSE ON A MAN'S FACE... He is STARING at us with fixed concentration. He is sweating slightly in the summer heat. We hold for a moment. Silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen ceiling fan. WIDE SHOT - the Man, wearing military uniform, sits at his desk in his office, still staring straight ahead. SUPERED TITLES appear, reading: General Putkin, United States Army Intelligence SED. Arlington, Virginia. 1983. The General's assistant, LIEUTENANT BOONE, sits at his desk, working.

Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from the small window above them. From next door comes the faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it.

	Bob, there's something I have to tell you. When I said I was retired from the unit, that was a lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was just my cover. I've been reactivated. I couldn't tell you because this is a Black Op, but...I think you have a part to play. I think that's why you're with me.

	Your life is like a river, Bob. If you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That's not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies. Like those doodles you just "happened" to draw?

And then you rip out one of his eyeballs Or you use a pen, stab him in the neck, create a fountain of blood, I mean really a fountain, get the blood to squirt on his buddies. That's a psychic disincentive, right there.

The Driver of the Pick-Up crosses to the TWO INSURGENTS with a half-gallon bottle of WATER and passes it to them. They drink and confer briefly in Arabic.

Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn sprinting towards him. Before he can turn to aim at him, Lyn LEAPS into the air, spinning around, face contorted as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK.

	Of course, Lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so I still think what he did was kinda...reckless.

The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his ass. Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle. The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races away over the sand. The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him. Beat. Nobody moves.

They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man dangling between them. Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and roar towards them.

FLATTENED SECTION OF FENCE Bob and Lyn stand at one side, Bill at the other, beckoning the prisoners through, hugging the prisoners as they pass through.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're very sorry. Ma'assalama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYN_CASSADY>
<DIRECTION>
One by one the Iraqis walk out through the broken fence, staring around them suspiciously, expecting a trap. Nothing happens, no one shoots them.

	That's it. Keep going. Ma'assalama.

The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand. Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob, tripping heavily, is staring with fascination at the sand trickling through his fingers. Suddenly we hear the building whine of the HELICOPTER engine starting up. Bob looks up, puzzled.

HELICOPTER Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper, Bill at the controls. Lyn is holding the flowers. Bob appears, hurrying over.

The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying, staring up. Lyn smiles sadly through the window, raises his hand. The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves goodbye.

	At the time I was hurt that Lyn hadn't taken me with him. But now I know it was because he and Bill had already seen what was to come.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody knows exactly what happened. The official story is that their helicopter must have crashed, either because they were hit by an RPG or because...well, that's what happens when you fly a helicopter while you're tripping on acid. All I know is they've never been seen since. Like all Shaman they returned to the sky.
	</DIALOGUE>

The helicopter disappears altogether.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And finally, US forces in Iraq are using what some are calling a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and many parents would agree! Some prisoners are being forced to listen to Barney the Purple Dinosaur sing the I Love You song. I think after an hour of that they'll spill the beans! Don't you? Let's go outside to Al for the weather.

	That was it. That was the only bit of my story that ran anywhere. And it was a joke. And if I ever needed proof of how the Dark Side have taken the beautiful dream of what a nation could be and had twisted it, destroyed it, that was it.

Bob stands up. He starts to walk down the office, his face set with grim determination.
