A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler:
</DIRECTION>
<FENNEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about "MAX?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He set up the Operation-

	There was no operation! You were never radioed orders!

	I talked to him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<FENNEL>

	You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "MAX?"

	Wait - are you saying you're Max?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FENNEL>

The LARGE MAN finally steps out of the shadows. Special Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him.
</DIRECTION>
<WADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Max" is catch-all for exactly what you've been accused of. Terminology's been around since the 50's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence as the guys take this in.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't kill those kids, Wade.

Wade studies him. Finally:

Fennel sighs.

<FENNEL>

A nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Older. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down.

In the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH. Indulging in a nightly ritual...

Hollywood, Florida. DOGS IN FULL SPRINT. A few thousand SPECTATORS. Not the Derby, but reasonably enthused.

IN THE CHEAP SEATS -- CLAY and ROQUE. Three years older. But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS, following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH LINE. Roque checks their ticket. Yawns.

Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger - A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's...

Something glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks across the track, towards the PARKING LOT.

	Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low.

EXT. MOTEL SIX -- AFTERNOON

Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:

INT. BUSTER'S BOOZE & BURGERS

Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky- tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor.

	Yabba Dabba Doo...

</PARTICULARLY_OFFENSIVE_GUY>

<AISHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men.

Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up.

They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay.

Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...

WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE. Both breathing hard. Staring at one another:

She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him. This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors...

They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE --

INT. CHINOOK COCKPIT -- DAY We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal --

FADE TO:

INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off.

EXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING

Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:

HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the fumes...

CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless:

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON FENNEL as he and the Team sit bound and gagged in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots panicked glances to Clay. The ramp closes between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay turns back to

Aisha pulls the trigger.

Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.

Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in BOTH LEGS!

Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:

Roque considers. Then:

<ROQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were good guys.

Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No such thing. I'll go call Max.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADE>
<DIRECTION>
He begins walking towards HANGAR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! As the FENCE by the AIRSTRIP is SMASHED INWARDS by the Van! Headed straight for him! Clay, WAVING:

	Hi, Wade!

</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
BY THE PLANE

Roque turns to the Pilot:

<ROQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Declan, start the plane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROQUE>
<DIRECTION>
BY THE HANGAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WADE raises his UZI and FIRES - Taking out the Van's front tires! THE VAN Flips! Smashing end over end, finally coming to a rest on it's side! Climbing out, groaning:
</DIRECTION>
<POOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time, remind me - car crash first, then get shot...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds less painful that way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to Taxi. ROQUE stands in they back - loading ramp still down. FLIPS CLAY A SALUTE...
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cougar and I are going after that plane. The rest of you, get Wade.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell is she going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...
</DIRECTION>
<POOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You call me legless Pooch again, you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

ON THE RUNWAY

Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROQUE

<DIRECTION>
Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The PILOT, yelling to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>

	We don't have enough runway to take off - we're going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>

	Fine, just get us in the air!

He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette! CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.

(a'la the Warriors)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!

(CONT'D) (INTO RADIO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...

He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...

	I think I just found our way out of here...

EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...
</DIRECTION>
<ROQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta admit, I always wondered how this would play out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aisha thinks you kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<ROQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a distinct possibility...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROQUE>
<DIRECTION>
They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.

</DIRECTION>

	You don't have a knife?

	Don't need one.

<ROQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bit of as longshot for you...

</ROQUE>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Roque LUNGES AT HIM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.
</DIRECTION>
<ROQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I really am gonna cut your head off...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROQUE>
<DIRECTION>
He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out, TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting... Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand, which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which seems to make Clay happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN... TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT EAGLE levelled at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHIT-
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORVETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep Clay from rolling off the hood...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's final run to get up to speed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORVETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rifle...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT... VISUALIZE THIS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway. The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORVETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE, causing the bike to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as Roque dies very badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares at the sight before him. Only one word for it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Outstanding.

</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.
</DIRECTION>
<JENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar.
	</DIALOGUE>

(off Pooch's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a cool name-

From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:

TIGHT ON CLAY realizing who he's talking to.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I understand you've always wanted to meet face to face. I'm sure that could be arranged...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think the guys you're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We win. You lose. Goodbye.

He snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire. Turns to the others.

</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar start for the Hangar. Clay looks to Aisha. A moment between them.
</DIRECTION>
<AISHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death. Max, his men, everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AISHA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That why you slept with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<AISHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That and the cardio.

Clay smiles.

A beat. She nods.

	I'm coming.

</AISHA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good cause there's no way I could walk it...

She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they head for the Hangar. Together.

Max lowers the phone. Looking stunned. The Short Scientist has run out of patience.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_SCIENTEST>

	Time is up, Stretch.

Max looks at the Short Scientist.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stretch. That's a good one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
But he doesn't look like he's very amused.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORT_SCIENTEST>

	Because you are so much taller than I.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, no, I get it...

Momentary pause. The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians. Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.

BLACK SCREEN

We think it's the end. But then we hear

WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound of evening television. Somewhere suburban...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nice quiet neighborhood. Outside the kitchen window Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door. Opens it and looks out to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is. Her breath hitches in her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she knows what it means.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someday. FADE OUT
