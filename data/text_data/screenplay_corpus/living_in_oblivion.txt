A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.

Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.

In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie- talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts.

She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 4:13 A.M.

In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.

	I got two films coming up right after yours, Nick. One I play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with. The other I'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder.

	I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. And I just want to tell you, I'm really happy we can work together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<PALOMINO>

	Hey, me too! You're a great director, man. Your films are wacked! And I'm gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. I'm gonna pick your brain.

<DIRECTION>
A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks for a long moment.

<GAFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be a kiss with nudity.

</GAFFER>
<AC>

<GAFFER>

</GAFFER>
<AC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.

</AC>
<GAFFER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</AC>
<GAFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. Feature. I brought my script.

</GAFFER>

The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise, out of his back pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GAFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm going to give it to him right during lunch. Maybe right after.

	Jesus, what are you doing?

Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then Palomino approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<PALOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?

Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration.

Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.

The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the open set window.

The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the mike.

</NICK>
<PALOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm sorry it had to come out like this but I told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal," and she didn't want to hear that. She wanted more, you see what I'm saying? It's rejection.

	Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. I apologize. Chad, I apologize to you too. I'm completely unfocused here and I think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow.

Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.

<NICK>

	Don't know that either. But I'm not worrying about it. I had this dream last night where I was on the set. You were in it, and another woman, someone older. Anyway, everything was going wrong. The harder I tried to hold things together the more they fell apart. And you know what that dream was telling me, Nicole? You just got to roll with it. And that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling with it. So, we'll just shoot the Dream Sequence today.

Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.

	You were great, you're a natural. And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't you dare tell me that felt fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.

At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet.

The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection.
</DIRECTION>

CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed.

The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, passing over faces in different degrees of thought.
</DIRECTION>

Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.
</DIRECTION>

	In closing I'd like to say to all the people who told me not to make this movie, who wouldn't meet with me or return a simple phone call. To my favorite professor at Film School whose parting advice to me was to take a job teaching at a women's college. To Delores DelSporto, the girl I loved in high school who left me for a Jr. Varsity football player: to all these people I'd like to say thank you but I can't because what I really feel like saying is go fu -- !!

MS Nick, his head and body jerking in a sudden spasm. He finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and the Sound man frowns hard at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU the Sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds have passed. The camera stays on the watch until the final five seconds have elapsed.
