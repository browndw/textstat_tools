THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball erupting over one side of the embassy.

INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and CIVILIANS. Lee and Carter walk in. Lee is trying to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open, watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael Jackson, singing his heart out. Dancing and making eyes at a few of the smitten women who are watching him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?

</CARTER>
<LEE>

	Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.

</LEE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.

The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS. The GANGSTERS look around frantically. An apartment building is under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. Their only way out is UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING. Lee wastes no time going after them. With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, Lee. I'm coming.

Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding. NOT EVEN CLOSE. He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS. They all tear off the LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off. The clatter of wood against wood as they beat at each other. Wrestling over his pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY to pull himself up. Just as he gets his chin above the bar... snap! It BREAKS and he drops. Then...

He dashes into the stairwell. ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS come at Lee. He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which SEE-SAWS them off-balance. With the advantage, he BATTERS them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off. He climbs after the GANGSTER LEADER.

Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE ROOF!
</DIRECTION>

He falls along the side of the building. He manages to grab the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!
</DIRECTION>

They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives. Hu Li looks down at them. She has no weapon to finish them off. She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off. The man covers his naked body. Lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms -- blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel, his robe, or some other found object.

Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor. Ricky Tan walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off, leaving him alone on the docks.

Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

INT. YACHT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men, politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of the slip. He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW. He clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner - almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN REIGN. Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed, impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing -- money. He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives, Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire as sociopath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li. Carter hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room for signs of trouble. He heads into the main party.

Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of champagne. Carter lights her cigarette for her.

<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow the Rich White Man?

</LEE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.

</CARTER>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow the RichWhiteMan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one. Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

</CARTER>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.

</CARTER>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know he's our man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEE>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because when the shooting started he was way too cool. See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound like that all the time.

Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

The Dragon ate so much and grew so big -- that he eventually got stuck inside the cave -- and the treasure was stuck behind him for all eternity.

Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind his back. Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her knife in the other. She takes a step toward Isabella.

On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND DISAPPEAR into the crowd. It lands on a DRINK CART. Before Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the detonator on her rounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator. He JUMPS atop a BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage. He can't see it, but he does see:

Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE. The quickest way is the HIGH WAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE. Scattering playing cards. Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller -- landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in the Sky Room. He grins.

No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive. Kicks and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH! He bobs and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in between swings. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone HITS THE DECK. Carter and Lee dive on to the floor as panic ripples through the Casino. People FLEE for the EXITS.

Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it! A high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch. He LUNGES for it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY. The second it hits the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room. Hu Li STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li. As she bends to PICK up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

Hu Li lifts the detonator.
