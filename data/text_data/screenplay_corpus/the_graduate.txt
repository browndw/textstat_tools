	- and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless. But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.

EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun shines brightly. Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR. and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and LOUISE, who are eight or nine. Watching from across the fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next door and her boy friend. Across the fence on the other side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch- ing. One of them holds a baby. The Braddocks, the Arnolds and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house. The others are grouped, more or less, at the other end. Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BRADDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, over there -- I mean you! Your attention please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BRADDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen. He speaks quickly - in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

They all laugh and some applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BRADDOCK>

INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people applaud.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Folks - this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BRADDOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall. Everything is slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the pool. Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool. They both begin to motion us toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We get to the deep end of the pool. Mr. Braddock signals us with his hand to go under. He kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under. He has a big smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look. The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under. We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

<DIRECTION>
PULL UP AND UP AND UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners, swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing, sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools. SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND of the WIND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hold for a few seconds, then:

SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

<DIRECTION>
SOUND of her HANGING UP. Ben hangs up slowly. He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. As they get through, Ben starts to move inside. At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. He follows them into the lobby. They move toward the front desk and he moves with them. One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some- where. The group of young people passes by the desk and Ben moves in behind them. He pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively.

Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby. He puts on his jacket as he goes. He gets to the entrance to the main ballroom. He pauses at the door, looks in.

What he sees: People dancing, talking, sitting, etc. He turns back toward te lobby. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he sees: The room clerk scross the lobby watching him.

Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

	Oh - not too much. Taking it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MR_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.

</MR_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will.

</BEN>
<MRS_BRADDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well why do you - why do you think that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_BRADDOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRADDOCK>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?

<MRS_BRADDOCK>

	But I don't want you to make up something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRADDOCK>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. But I'm - I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after -

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I mean are we dead or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you tired of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>

	I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well what do you want to talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything. Anything at all.

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?

<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for her shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you?

</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not interested in art?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you want to talk about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<DIRECTION>
Ben nods and looks at the rug.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take off my clothes now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really want me to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do.

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Ben starts shaking his head.

<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to hear it or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the after- noon I read a novel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What novel did you read.

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>

	I don't remember.

</MRS_ROBINSON>
<DIRECTION>
Ben nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until -

</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you - how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There isn't any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no risk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you get out of the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I walk out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You walk right out the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what about the noise from the car. What if -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The driveway's on my side of the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down, Benjamin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let's keep going here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I undress and talk at the same time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't - I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No we don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well how long has this been going on.

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the ceiling for a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About five years.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. Are you kidding me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have not slept with your husband for five years?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now and then. He geats drunk a few times a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, is this interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've talked enough, Benjamin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't hate him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(unhooking her blouse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well how do you feel about him, then?

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She nods and takes off her blouse.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.

<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never did, Benjamin. Now let's -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, wait a minute. You married him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do that?

<DIRECTION>
(taking off her stockings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See if you can guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think real hard, Benjamin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell Elaine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you shocked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Now let's get to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not particularly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>

	Was he a law student at the time?

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.

<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you asking me all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art?

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BEN>
<MRS_ROBINSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROBINSON>
<BEN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled. A tuxedoed HOOD leads them through the tables to a table directly under the stage on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her dress. There is one chair facing the stage, the other with its back to and up against the stage. Ben sits down in the chair facing the stage. Elaine stands for a moment, unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage. She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them. Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and puts them on. The two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at Elaine.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you watch the show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string. She is twirling the tassels.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're missing a great effect here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

	Could you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The stripper sees Elaine look. The stripper smiles toward Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she walks. Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair. The spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's face. As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it and holds it up in the air. The music stops and a DRUM ROLL starts. The stripper bends over Elaine's head and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in front of Elaine's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - BEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward slightly to watch the action. The swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster. The tassels swing more frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - ELAINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - BEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - ELAINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through Ben's glasses. Elaine's face seen darkly but fully for the first time. The tassels swing in front of it. Tears start out of her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - BEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches up to remove the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - ELAINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh spill from the spotlight. The tears are running down her face. Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight at Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - BEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his glasses off, he watches her. He reaches forward and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.
</DIRECTION>
<STRIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entrance to the strip joint. Elaine runs to the bottom of the steps. The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside is crowded with people moving back and forth. Ben follows her. She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk. Ben catches her and holds her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine - I'm sorry.

</ELAINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying to get her to look at him. She keeps looking away.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But could I just tell you this one thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whole idea - this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh - that's very nice of you to tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. What I mean is - that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cry. People on the sidewalk are looking at them. She turns away from them. Ben moves away from them. Ben moves around in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen - could you stop crying, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I couldn't.

</ELAINE>
<BEN>

	But could you try?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
She brings both hands up to her face. Ben looks at her for a few moments in agony. Then, very determined, he takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from her face. She looks up startled. She starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side of her face. He opens his hands against her face, freeing her hands. Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on. After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine -

</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the slot on their right. Its RADIO is tuned into a rock and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY. Ben leans across Elaine and speaks through the window to the kid behind the wheel.

<DIRECTION>
Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT - BEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he watches them go. His artificial smile disappears. The agony is such that he has to steady himself with his hand on the rail. He turns his face away, toward the cage. There is an animal in it, staring at Ben. They look at each other. There is a box - an automatic device with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place. He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can, crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer. He crosses to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and takes a newspaper out of it. He crosses to the chair and sits down. He holds the newspaper in front of him. It is hopelessly crumpled. He gets up, crosses to the bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron. He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires to straighten it out with the iron.

There is a KNOCK on the door. He rises, puts the iron back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can, then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper on his lap.
