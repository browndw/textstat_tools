It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow Randolph and the Krinkle Kids." RANDOLPH SMILEY, a clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie, dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids" (little people in top hats). He sings one of his signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes." One of the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind him.

"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating "Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows. Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the kid shows.

INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five grand stares him in the face.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the "performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy. Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of methadone which they immediately drink.

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front. A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.

He now clings to Stokes' lapels.

<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I sit around while that rhinoceros... that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime? You and I have history, Frank! Please!

Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat.

	There's nothing I can do for you. Nothing. You're a pariah. I can't even be seen with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKES>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in deep, deep shit. They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse... I got bookies breathing down my neck. I'm homeless! Don't you hear what I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it! The clock's ticking! Put yourself in my shoes, for Christ's sake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<STOKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ugly truth is, your shoes have become my shoes. As long as the rhino's on the air, everything's by the book. No skim, no percentage. Nothing. The network wanted squeaky clean and they got it. And believe me, Mopes is sparkling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKES>
<DIRECTION>
He looks Randolph squarely in the eye.

	You're totally broke? You don't have a dime left to your name?

Stokes is gone. Randolph takes a swig from his flask and wipes his chin with his sleeve. He stares out at the river.

The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's staff are in on the meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again, these are just prototypes. I've been assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out before Christmas.

Sheldon raises his hand. Nora ignores him and looks at her watch.

	Okay, so let's recap before we break up...

<DIRECTION>
(refers to notes)

	Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to the Smoochy string cheese. And we're in a dick-measuring contest with Brown & Brown over the shampoo split.

Sheldon suddenly stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, time out, people! If I may interject, I think we're putting the cart before the horse here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nora throws him an icy look.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoochy's still earning the trust of the kids. We don't want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible. Huh? Without all the bells and whistles and rickata-rackita. What do you say, guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk and sails it toward the open door. It lands in the hallway.

Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet building which is located in the heart of Times Square and heads down Broadway. Sheldon emerges from the building.

<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Nora, wait up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good meeting today. I thought we tackled some hot issues. Although, I'll be honest, there were a few times that I felt my voice wasn't being heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's a conservative estimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want the show to have some weight, you know? Some substance. Silly songs, sure -- but with a message. Pop quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook?

</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you sense my complete lack of interest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>

	Try two thousand. Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. Don't you get it, Nora? I'm a valuable resource. Use me.

Nora stops. She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>

<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only reason you're on TV right now is because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag. I didn't discover you, I delivered you. Like a bag of groceries. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish. So don't peddle your sap to me, rhino. Your job is just to smile and nod your head.
	</DIALOGUE>

She walks off.

INT. PATSY'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... No, no, you misunderstand me. It's not that I'm literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ. I'm just saying that the Captain, like Christ, was someone you could believe in. Those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata. It was all about the work. Especially Jesus. Forget about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>

<DIRECTION>
Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in the business to make you rich. He's in it to make Frank Stokes rich. That's how these network goons operate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's so sad. Is it just me, or is that sad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, years ago, a client of mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a problem...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, before the asshole found religion. Anyway, Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points. Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that weren't moving. Now Frank and I are old friends, so I say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me the warehouse' -- see, I know the fucking warehouse is in the Bronx, and I know it's emptier than my wife's head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To make a long story short, I walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Burke laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very amusing, but I don't care about Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax... I just want more creative input. This rhino came from my womb. I bore him, I nursed him, and dammit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
He pounds his fist on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should be the one who raises him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shel, it's all about the dough. After you get the money, you get the power. And after you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny, that never crossed my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, until then... you're just another puppet in the prop room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Sheldon his card.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PATSY'S - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you! I saw you in there... at my table... talking to him.

Burke walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers, mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect batch of cock cookies for a very special rhino.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the tray aside.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, you're going to learn about shame, my dear Smoochy. And I'm your professor.

He laughs.

It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of giddy children are led into the studio where they take seats on the bleachers.

<DIRECTION>
BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Nora. Why was the 'Please and Thank You Song' cut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's sappy and it takes away from the 'Cookie Song.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Takes away? It enhances it! The cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'Please and Thank You' coda! That's the moral anchor! That's where the lesson is! You can't sell the sizzle without the steak!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie Song' lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that. I will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar. I have to look myself in the mirror every morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is network television, not a sprout farm. We're here to sell sugar and plastic. That's what keeps the lights on.

	You're treating me like a puppet. You know that? Well, guess what? I am not your puppet.

	Since when? Now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras.

An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then stops. He looks back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have different eyes, Nora. When I go out there I see kids. You see wallets with pigtails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring at him from under the stairwell. After a beat, Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's clutching a duffle bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door. He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bon soir, la Smoochy. Welcome to fatty Arbuckle-land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps. Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment, along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
(softly to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow Randolph will return...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with rising anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After these messages!

</RANDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag. He then stuffs his old costume into his duffle bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO B - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping. The Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin' the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to their feet, cheering and applauding.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOOCHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, all that jiggyin' and ziggyin' sure makes a fella hungry! Now if only I had my super duper, super secret, super special...

The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes the cookies! Fresh and organic, no need to panic! Right from the soil, no tropical oils! Sweetened with juice, for an energy boost! Fiber galore, you'll be askin' for more...'

He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its descent.
</DIRECTION>

The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.

	Oooh... just the smell of unprocessed flour makes my tummy do somersaults!

<DIRECTION>
SMOOCHY

He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big grin.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOOCHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow! Look at this cookie, kids! A rocket ship!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMOOCHY>

Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket cookie from Smoochy.

Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a chair near Stokes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you all for coming. I just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles I feel we're having in the communication department. No finger-pointing. Lord knows when you start pointing fingers, someone gets poked in the eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon laughs. Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced.

He pats Sheldon's head like a dog.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>

	See this guy, Frank? Take a good long look, 'cause this prick saved your life. Without him you'd be sitting in Kaplan's right now, sucking club soda through a paper straw.

Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar.

	Allow me to untangle this web of shit! I don't care what his resume was, I don't care where you found him, I don't care if his last job was juggling apples for a hut full of Pygmies on the outskirts of the Congo... the fact is, he fits a bill and you need him. Like a hungry baby needs a big tit. And that, my friends, is why you're in a box with no ventilation. And that is why the rhino is going to get what he deserves.

	And don't forget the corporate penthouse. It took me six years to get that for Randolph.

Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking, grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them. Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand.

Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy apartment. A "Rhinette" costume is draped over one of the chairs. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door. Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices on the shelf above. He pulls out a revolver. The POUNDING continues.

We WIDEN OUT to see Sheldon buying the magazine at the newsstand in front of the Kidnet Building. He turns and walks toward the Kidnet entrance. He stops and looks up at the building. Smiling, he takes a deep breath and enters.

	Well, I was never much of the do- se-do type, but what I would love to do is take you out to lunch one day. You know, just two colleagues chewing the fat... forming a mutual respect... planting the seeds of cooperation...

	Okay then, I'll be in my office if you need me. If you want to brainstorm about anything. Ideas and so forth.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<SHELDON>

	You know what? Maybe I can find Spinner a little something to do on the show. That's probably the best solution.

</BURKE>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ice shows represent everything I'm against. They're mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kid's mouth on the ride home.

</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know you got this fetish for ethics, but now's not the time to fly that kite. No one's ever refused a shot at an ice show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon tears the contract in half.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell out, Burke. You should be proud of that. Proud that you represent a client who paves driveways, not paints them over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>

Burke just sits there, stunned. A waitress, SANDY, passes by the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a pineapple juice, Sandy.

<SANDY>

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band. Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately, his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOOCHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, wasn't that fun? In an awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how 'bout a big round of applause for the newest member of the Smoochyland Band... former heavyweight contender, Spinner Dunn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMOOCHY>
<DIRECTION>
Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Sorry.

INT. BACKSTAGE - AFTER SHOW

A beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in costume.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I do good, Sheldon, huh? Did I do good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNER>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that was great, Spinner. Just watch your elbow next time. Pinky's probably gonna lose that tooth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<SPINNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okey doke. I'm gonna go get drunk now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNER>
<DIRECTION>
Spinner skips off humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" and banging his cowbell. Nora passes Sheldon backstage.

<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice job. Casting the show with mental patients, I like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not a mental patient. He's an ex-boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five-year-old!

EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb to hail a cab. A friendly-looking man in a suit and bow tie approaches him. This is MERV GREEN.

</MERV>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks anyway, but I'm going uptown.

INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo. A big thug in an overcoat, HENRY, is already sitting there. Merv gets in behind him and shuts the door. Sheldon is now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down Broadway. Merv extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MERV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a pleasure to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're hoping for an autograph, the gun's a bit much. The whole 'catch more flies with honey' thing -- it really holds water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon laughs nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<MERV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheldon, I represent the Parade of Hope Foundation. Maybe you've heard of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You raise money to build children's hospitals, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<MERV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been known to add a brick or two, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV>
<DIRECTION>
Merv and the thug laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MERV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheldon, let me get right to the point -- there's talk on the street that you're pulling out of the ice show. Is that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV>
<SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
(big sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I never agreed to an ice show, nor would I ever agree to do an ice show, and let me add that none of this is your concern, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<MERV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen carefully, son: Parade of Hope has sponsored every Kidnet ice show since 1964. We take a piece off the top and everybody walks away happy. So let's not buck history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I appreciate the offer, but for the gazillionth time, I'm not doing an ice show, so we have nothing to discuss. Now, if you'll just pull over, I'll get out and we'll say our toodley-dos.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far corner, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<MERV>

<DIRECTION>
(to driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over, Terry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERV>

The car pulls to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<MERV>

	And as far as the ice show goes... I recommend you start shopping for skates.

The door pops open and Sheldon is tossed out.

INT. CORPORATE PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from the carton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon is on the phone with Burke.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is unacceptable, Burke! I'm calling the authorities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it, Shel. You rat on Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky if they find your toenails. These guys are the roughest of all the charities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was threatened by an organization that's supposed to help children! What kind of world is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The real one. My advice? Consider the ice show and stay healthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS. He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise, Nora is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly. Sheldon notices she's holding a pint of whiskey.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting drunk and I'm not used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, not to make you feel worse, but with alcohol you're also consuming empty calories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nora looks at him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that... I want to apologize, actually. And on those rare occasions when I feel the need to apologize for something, it helps if I'm, you know... shit- faced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. I'm honored.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nora trips slightly. Sheldon takes the whiskey from her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we get some air?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her out on the balcony. They look out at the city.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day. A little out of line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that was probably insensitive as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you're not doing the ice show. I find that... incredibly admirable. Why didn't you tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I didn't want to spoil your fun. You look so content when you're berating me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Nora looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I have become a bit hardened over the years. Sincerity's an easy disguise in this business. It's hard to know who's on the level.

	Believe me, I'm learning that more and more every day.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember Rickets?

</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my favorite show when I was a kid. Rickets was the one face I knew I could trust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how I felt! Rickets had real depth. He was my inspiration for Smoochy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? He was my inspiration to work in children's television.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe it. I never met anyone who even remembers Rickets. Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance?

</SHELDON>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember it? I did it at my first communion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky- Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That was a mistake, right? I didn't mean for that to hap--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>

Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her. They begin kissing passionately.
</DIRECTION>

</NORA>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh... you don't have to explain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>

They continue to kiss. Nora abruptly stops.

<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should go.

<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse.

Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of them says anything for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get that. Good night.

She exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to the bar to pour himself another orange juice before picking up the phone.

ANGELO'S APARTMENT

We GO TO a HORIZONTAL SPLIT-SCREEN. Randolph is on the BOTTOM HALF. He lies on his bed in Angelo's apartment wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head. His head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone. The SHOT is reminiscent of Bye Bye Birdie.

Sheldon is in the back seat. The Smoochy costume is next to him. Behind the wheel is Randolph. He's in disguise.

	Don't be silly. The chance to have Smoochy the Rhino perform at our little soiree? I'd carry you piggy-back through a bed of hot rusty glass if I had to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>

(getting frustrated)

	Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you take particular glee in that you basically stole his time slot? Helped shovel dirt onto his miserable corpse, as it were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I would never take pleasure in someone's downfall. You know the old expression about walking a mile in another man's shoes? Well, that really holds water. Just try to imagine --

	Heil Smoochy! Heil Smoochy! Heil Smoochy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAZIS>
<DIRECTION>
A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing him like Patton in front of the American flag. Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He searches for just the right words, and finally...
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my sincere hope that I'm dreaming right now, but in the event that I'm not... what's the deal with the swastikas?
	</DIALOGUE>

Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse.

<CEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here at Kidnet, Smoochy the Rhino is now Smoochy the Ghost. We have excised that particular malignancy from our network and will seek out a suitable replacement. Until then, the Smoochy slot will be safely occupied by Popeye cartoons. Thank you.

	Perform? I barely sang one song.

	Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot swastika you were standing in front of might've given you a hint.

Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye.

Sheldon looks crushed.

<SHELDON>

	But what about the balcony? What about the Klunky-Wunky dance?

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAYS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets, looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall -- a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CONEY ISLAND STATION - STREET LEVEL - LATER

Sheldon comes up from the subway. We see the Cyclone from Astroland in the b.g.

<OLD_VAGRANT>

</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for Youngsters' is the hottest show on Japanese television. The sweat shops are working overtime trying to keep up with the demand. Record albums, toys, cereal, tee shirts, you name it...

INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI -- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office. Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>

<CHICK>

Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy, walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my. And what is this on my desk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKES>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy the slot and we'll round it off to a million. And you can keep the luggage.

</CHICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dealing with an honorable culture, Frank. We know how to play ball.

</CHICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money. He looks up at Chick and smiles.

INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen. There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the "Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her surprise, Randolph is standing there.

Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes off his jacket.

<RANDOLPH>

	So here's the good news: Yes, I'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot. I know you and Frank are in a bind, so I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe, call props, tell 'em the R man is back and he's ready to start whistlin' dem happy tunes for da little chillens.

	Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone! You need that slot filled and I'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you shop?

</NORA>

	Come on. Have you lost all affection for me? After what we once had?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a long time ago. I was young and stupid.

</NORA>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why we broke up I'll never know.

He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so violently he almost falls over the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, Nora! The public is clamoring for me! I'm a fucking patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's evil! He's probably even gay! You should've seen the way he was checking me out in the car!

	You said he was checking you out in the car. What car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<RANDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi homosexual vibe! It emanates from the television! The whole Smoochy costume... with the erect horn... I mean, what's that all about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
Nora starts to walk closer to him. He backs up.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down. He's in black limbo.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOOCHY>

	Thank you. It's good to be back. You know, kids, sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair. A place where nice guys don't just finish last... they get their heads cut off.

Randolph sits in front of the TELEVISION in a daze. He's wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. ON the TV, an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves. The hosts, Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the standing ovation he got during the taping that day.

Burke's grin suddenly fades.

	Sheldon, you can't do an ice show and cut out the vendors. And more importantly, you can't cut out the Parade of Hope. It's suicide.

Two thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans, knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy torso.

Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor belt, huddled under a blanket.

Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon and Nora. They have their arms around each other. Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate. Angelo looks up.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally gets through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER DOWN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an alley by an abandoned building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn. Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts to strangle him.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking point a gun at me? A gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's your fucking etiquette?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing Sheldon's gun directly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Burke just looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. Before I pump one in that Grecian Formula scalp of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at Burke.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know something, kid? You've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were behind the Spinner hit, weren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a tragic mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes head sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If only one could turn back time...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what the hell, it's just one less mick in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son-of-a-bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon cocks the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my. What are you gonna do? Kill me? That wouldn't be very Smoochy-like behavior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. There's just one thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and steps out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not Smoochy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finally realized we're living in a different jungle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Sheldon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the courage to pull the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheldon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it, Shel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon turns around. It's Tommy and her boys.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
(sternly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay out of it, Tommy. This is my business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more killin', Shel. Enough's enough. Don't destroy who you are for this piece of shit. You mean something to the kids. Don't take Smoochy away from the kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He hands it to Tommy.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how I got pushed this far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're only human, Shel. The important thing is... you never went over the cliff. You're a good boy. For some of us... it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take it from here, kid, you run along with your girl. Get on with your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy, you're not going to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. Sometimes even a rat deserves a little mercy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks at Nora.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bus backfire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
She pats him on the back.

Stokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to his driver through the glass partition.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKES>
<DIRECTION>
The car doesn't move. Stokes pounds on the partition.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move this thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKES>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that lowers the partition. It slides down.
</DIRECTION>
<STOKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you deaf?! I said --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOKES>
<DIRECTION>
The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with Stokes. They slam the doors shut.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I could tell you it'll be quick and painless, Frank, but you know how these things go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in Japanese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora, who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes' final limo ride.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon and Nora pause on the street. Sheldon looks around him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, a little grime here and there doesn't change the fact... it's still a beautiful city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Nora.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go home, Smoochy. Show's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldon gazes back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not. It's just beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDON>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss passionately as MUSIC SWELLS and the CAMERA CRANES HIGH ABOVE the rink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP ON:

Randolph skates out, somewhat shakily, to huge applause. Sheldon puts his arm around him. The audience is now on their feet. Randolph especially basks in the adulation.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All proceeds from tonight's performance, will benefit the Rainbow Randolph Center for Alcoholism and Delusional Behavior.

Sheldon pats Randolph on the back. MUSIC BEGINS as Rhinettes and Krinkle Kids skate out. The show starts and the audience goes wild. Nora smiles from the stands as Smoochy and the others glide across the ice. (SMOOCHY /RANDOLPH DUET TO COME.)

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
