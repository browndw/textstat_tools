:SC: CITY AT NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hearse of Late Twenties vintage is proceeding at a dignified pace along a half-deserted wintry street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the hearse, there are four somber men in black - and a coffin, of course, with a wreath of chrysanthemums on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the men is driving, another is in the seat beside him. The other two are sitting in the rear of the hearse, flanking the coffin. All four seem fully aware of the solemnity of the occasion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now they hear a SIREN, faint at first, but rapidly growing louder. The driver and the man next to him exchange a nervous glance. The other two men move tensely toward the rear door of the hearse, raise the black curtain over the glass panel, and peek out cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the glass panel, they see a police car bearing down on them, the red light blinking, the SIREN screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men at the rear window gesture to the driver to step on it. He does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hearse, obviously a souped-up job, instantly picks up speed, weaves crazily through traffic, the police car in hot pursuit. The hearse careens around a corner at eighty miles an hour, the police car right on its tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By this time the policemen are leaning out of their car with drawn guns, firing at the hearse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men in the rear of the hearse, flattened against the sides, pull a couple of sawed-off shotguns out of a hidden overhead rack. Police bullets smash the glass panel and whistle through the hearse. The driver and the man next to him duck, but the hearse continues at the same breakneck speed. The two men in back shove their guns through the shattered glass, fire at the police car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite the hail of lead, the police car - its windshield cobwebbed with bullet holes - gains on the hearse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the car skids out of control, jumps the curb, comes to a screeching stop. Policemen leap out, fire after the hearse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the speeding hearse, the last of the police bullets thud into the coffin. Instantly three geysers of liquid spurt through the bullet holes. As the firing recedes, the two men in the back put away their guns, remove the wreath from the coffin, take the lid off. The inside is jam-packed with bottles of booze, some of them shattered by the bullets. As the men start to lift out the broken bottles - SUPERIMPOSE:

:SC: EXT. INTERSECTION OF STREETS - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Traffic is light. All the shops are dark except one - a dimly lit establishment, from which drift the mournful strains of an organ. A circumspect sign reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOZARELLA'S FUNERAL PARLOR 24 Hour Service
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the window, a sample coffin is on display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There seem to be some rites going on inside, because a number of mourners, singly and in couples, are hurrying from the cold, windy street into Mozarella's parlor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the hearse with the damp coffin draws up to the delivery entrance at the side of the building. The driver honks the horn - one long and two short - as the other men step down and start to slide the coffin out. The side door opens, and a dapper gent emerges. He wears a tight-fitting black suit, a black fedora, and gray spats. The spats are very important. He always wears spats. His name is SPATS COLOMBO. He cases the street, motions the men inside. As they carry the coffin past him, he removes his fedora, holds it reverently over his heart. Then he follows the men in, his head bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street and around the corner, three police cars draw up silently, and about fifteen uniformed policemen and plain-clothes men spill out. A Captain gives whispered orders, and the men scatter and discreetly take up positions around the funeral parlor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of one of the cars steps MULLIGAN, a tough Federal Agent - in plain clothes, of course. With him is a little weasel of a man, shivering with cold and fear. They call him TOOTHPICK CHARLIE for two reasons - because his name is Charlie, and because he has never been seen without a toothpick in his mouth.

The police captain joins Mulligan.

<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all set. When is the kickoff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
As Mulligan consults his watch, Charlie, the toothpick working nervously in his mouth, tugs Mulligan's sleeve.

Charlie scoots up the dark street, disappears.

They synchronize their watches. Then Mulligan crosses to Mozarella's parlor, unfolding the black crepe Charlie gave him. It is a mourning band, and he slips it over the left sleeve of his overcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MOZARELLA'S FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks legitimate enough - with potted palms, urns and funeral statuary. A harmless gray-haired man is playing the organ with appropriate feeling. Daintily arranging a funeral spray is the proprietor himself, MR. MOZARELLA. His heavyweight build, bashed-in nose and cauliflower ears don't quite jibe with his mourning coat, striped pants, ascot and carnation. Dusting one of the marble angels is another funeral director, in the same somber uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan enters.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZARELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(with grave sympathy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZARELLA>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because I've been on the wagon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>

</MOZARELLA>
<MULLIGAN>

	<DIALOGUE>

</FUNERAL_DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Mulligan past the organ toward the black-paneled wall, where there is no evidence of a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The organist, without missing a note in his playing, reaches over to the end of the keyboard and pulls out a stop. One of the panels slides open, and there is a blast of MUSIC from the chapel. It's jazz - and it's SWEET GEORGIA BROWN. Mulligan rears back momentarily, then follows the funeral director in. The organist pushes the stop in again, and the panel slides shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandma must have been quite a person, because she left a lot of condoling friends behind, and they are holding a very lively wake. The chapel is jumping. A small band is blaring out SWEET GEORGIA BROWN. The musicians are not the slick, well-fed instrumentalists you would find in Guy Lombardo's band - they have all been through the wringer, and so have their threadbare tuxedos. On the stamp-sized dance floor, six girls in abbreviated costumes are doing a frenetic Charleston. Crowded around the small tables, mourners in black arm-bands are drowning their sorrows in whatever they drink out of their coffee cups.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you gotta go-this is the way to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The funeral director leads Mulligan to a table next to the bandstand. As he moves off, a waiter comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll it be, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Booze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make is Scotch. A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
As the waiter starts away, Mulligan stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to a better table)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sir. That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
He winks, goes off. Mulligan scans the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a side door comes Spats Colombo, followed by the four hearsemen. They walk cockily toward the table 'reserved for the immediate family.' A DRUNK, standing with a cup of booze in his hand, is in their way. Colombo pushes him aside, and the contents of the cup slop over. Colombo freezes in his tracks, glances at his feet. The other four men have also stopped, and stare in the same direction, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats Colombo's immaculate spats are no longer immaculate. There is a whiskey stain on one of them. Colombo throws his henchmen a sharp look. They grab the offending drunk, hustle him toward the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK>
<DIRECTION>
(waving empty cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - I want another cup of coffee. I want another cup of coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUNK>
<DIRECTION>
Colombo proceeds toward the table, seats himself, crosses his legs, takes a handkerchief out of his breast pocket, and meticulously mops the moist spat. His four companions, their mission accomplished, join him at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan, who has been studying Colombo, consults his wrist-watch. The waiter comes up with his order - a demitasse half full of Scotch, and a split of club soda.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's going to raid a funeral?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people got no respect for the dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter moves off. Mulligan sips from the cup, winces, takes a cigar out of his pocket and starts to light it. His eyes wander to the chorus girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls have gone into a tap-dance. The captain of the chorus looks toward the bandstand, grins and winks at -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- JOE, the saxophone player. He winks back. JERRY, who is thumping the bass-fiddle behind him, leans forward and taps Joe on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(eye on tap-dancer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the mouthpiece out of his saxophone, wets the reed.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dentist? We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so selfish? We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, Joe.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.

</JERRY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a shoo-in. I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you giving me with the rabbit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>

(pulling form sheet out of pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But suppose he loses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But suppose it doesn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, slapping the bass, is no longer listening. His eyes have strayed to -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan, sitting at his table, puffing on the cigar. It isn't drawing too well. Mulligan reaches under his coat, unpins his Department of Justice badge from his vest. Using the pin of the shining badge, he pokes a hole in the wet end of the cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry has stopped playing, and is watching Mulligan's operation with morbid fascination. Joe, completely unaware, continues talking.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?

	Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods toward Mulligan. Joe looks off. Then, without a word, they both start packing their instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan pins the badge back on, checks his wrist-watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...four, three, two, one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He glances toward -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the door from the funeral parlor. Right on the dot, a pair of police axes smash through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instant pandemonium breaks loose in the speakeasy. MUSIC stops, women scream, customers, chorus girls and waiter scramble toward the side doors. But they too are splintering under the assault of the police axes. The crowd falls back, milling around frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan stands up, cups his hands to his mouth, and roars at the top of his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, everybody - this is a raid. I'm a federal agent, and you're all under arrest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Policemen come streaming through the splintered doors. Carried in on the tide is the Drunk who was just tossed out, reeling unsteadily, and waving his empty coffee cup aloft.

	I want another cup of coffee.

The policemen start rounding up the customers and employees, are herding them toward the exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bandstand, Joe and Jerry have packed their instruments, and start to fight their way through the milee, toward some stairs leading up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan, a couple of policemen in tow, comes up to Spats and his henchmen, sitting calmly at their table, with five glasses of white liquid in front of them.

He staggers into the alley, toward the side entrance of the speakeasy, CAMERA MOVING with him.

Joe and Jerry, carrying their instruments and overcoats, have just climbed through a window onto the fire escape, and are inspecting the scene below. The shot-up hearse is parked directly beneath them. stealthily they climb down the ladder, drop to the roof of the hearse. Then they scramble over the radiator, steal down the alley away from the street. They stop in the shadows to put on their coats.

Joe and Jerry come up to a door marked: KEYNOTE MUSICAL AGENCY - BANDS, SOLOISTS, SINGERS. Joe opens the door, revealing a crummy office, with a secretary behind a desk.

Joe shuts the door, and they shuffle along to the next agency, which is marked: JULES STEIN - MUSIC CORPORATION OF AMERICA. Joe opens the door. This is like the other office - except a little crummier. There is a secretary behind the desk.

He opens the door to the next agency. On the door it says: SIG POLIAKOFF - BANDS FOR ALL OCCASIONS. There is the usual secretary behind the usual desk, and her name is NELLIE. She is a brunette, somewhat past her prime, but still attractive.

Beside Nellie, there is another secretary pecking away at a typewriter. Nellie's face is grim as Joe and Jerry come up.

:SC: INT. POLIAKOFF'S INNER OFFICE - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is small and cluttered, and the walls are covered with photographs of Poliakoff's clients - bands, vocalists, trios, radio personalities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting behind the desk, speaking urgently into the phone, is SIG POLIAKOFF, a gruff, likable man in his fifties. Pacing up and down on the other side of the desk is SWEET SUE, flashily-dressed broad, who has seen thirty summers and a few hard winters. As she paces, she nervously flips a large white pill from one hand to the other. Slouched in a chair is BIENSTOCK, a somewhat prissy man of forty wearing thick glasses. He has a card file on his lap, is thumbing through it.
</DIRECTION>
<POLIAKOFF>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida - Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators - they need a couple of girls on sax and bass - what do you mean, who is this? Sig Poliakoff. I got a job for you - Gladys, are you there?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hangs up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meshugeh! Played for a hundred and twelve hours at a marathon dance, and now she's in bed with a nervous collapse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLIAKOFF>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her to move over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>

She has poured herself a glass of water from a pitcher on the desk, and now she plops the pill into her mouth, washes it down.
</DIRECTION>
<BIENSTOCK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Cora Jackson?

Sue has wandered over to one of the framed photos on the wall. It shows Sue posed in front of her band - sixteen girls, all blonde, all in identical gowns. On the drum it says SWEET SUE AND HER SOCIETY SYNCOPATORS.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those idiot broads! Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens? The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Bienstock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ought to fire you, Bienstock.

<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We might as well all slash our wrists if we don't round up two dames by this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up her handbag. Bienstock rises, takes his glasses off, puts them in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<BIENSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Sig, you know the kind of girls we need. We don't care where you find them - just get them on that train by eight o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIENSTOCK>
<POLIAKOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be nonchalant. Trust Poliakoff. The moment anything turns up, I'll give you a little tingle.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if I have room for another ulcer?

Bienstock opens the door, and follows Sue into the outer office. Joe and Jerry, who have been biding their time outside, slip in and shut the door after them.

There are rows of parked cars, a lube rack and a gas pump. Against the wall under a naked electric light bulb hanging from a cord, five men are playing stud poker.

A couple of mechanics, in grease-stained coveralls, are watching the game. The dealer is Toothpick Charlie, the inevitable toothpick in his mouth.

Joe and Jerry come in from the street. One of the mechanics notices them, nudges Toothpick Charlie. Charlie looks up, and seeing the instrument cases, leaps to his feet, drawing a gun from his shoulder holster. The other four players also jump up, and pulling their guns, level them at Joe and Jerry.

From the street outside comes the loud squeal of tires. Jerry glances off casually toward the entrance.

A black Dusenberg bursts the chain hanging across the street entrance, skids into the garage, takes to a screeching stop some ten feet from the card players. Toothpick Charlie and his cronies leap up and reach for their guns. Too late. Four men have scrambled out of the car, two armed with submachine guns, the other two with sawed-off shotguns. We recognize them as Spats Colombo's henchmen.

Jerry is watching the scene, open-mouthed. Joe grabs his shoulder, pulls him down behind the Hupmobile.

<DIRECTION>
The Second Henchman notices the mechanic standing petrified beside the gas pump.

<DIRECTION>
A pair of men's feet step down from the limousine. They are encased in immaculate spats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, crouching behind the Hupmobile with Joe, grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Spats Colombo -
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Joe clamps his hand over Jerry's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats Colombo joins his armed henchmen, who are covering the seven men facing the wall with their hands up.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
<DIRECTION>

<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I wouldn't say that. You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
He has strolled over to the table, and picking up the deck of cards, starts to deal out another round to the abandoned poker hands.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about.

<TOOTHPICK_CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest, Spats. I had nothing to do with it.

</TOOTHPICK_CHARLIE>

Spats deals Toothpick Charlie's fifth card, then turns up the hole card.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad, Charlie. You would have had three eights.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flips cards away)

<DIRECTION>
(a scream)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOOTHPICK_CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Spats nods, and the two machine-gunners raise their weapons, start to fire methodically at their off-scene victims.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the Hupmobile, Jerry screws his eyes shut painfully as the steady chatter of bullets continues.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm going to be sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The machine guns stop firing. There is a moment's silence. Suddenly, the bas tank of the Hupmobile overflows, and the rubber hose from the pump whips out, gushing gasoline over the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats and his henchmen, hearing the SOUND, whirl around and catch sight of Joe and Jerry squatting behind the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right - come on out of there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry emerge quakingly from behind the Hupmobile. They try to raise their hands, but find this rather difficult to manage while holding on to their instruments. Jerry darts a horrified glance toward the foot of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't see anything -
	</DIALOGUE>

</JOE>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Spats)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - nothing. Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe nudges him violently with his elbow, and he breaks off.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
(studying them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I know you two from somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -

<DIRECTION>
(starting to edge away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Jerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Urbana. It's a hundred miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't going nowhere.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not?

</JERRY>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only way you'll get to Urbana is feet first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
During this, one of the bodies huddled grotesquely against the foot of the wall begins to stir. It is Toothpick Charlie. He is covered with blood, but there is still a spark of life in him, and his toothpick is still clutched between his teeth. Painfully, he starts to worm his way across the floor toward a phone on a wooden shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats and his gang, facing Joe and Jerry, are not aware of Charlie's activity.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like no witnesses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We won't breathe a word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
He motions lazily to the Second Henchman. The henchman slowly levels his machine gun at Joe and Jerry, who stand frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that very moment, Toothpick Charlie reaches up for the phone. But he is too weak to hold on, and the receiver drops from his limp hand, and clatters to the asphalt floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, Spats and his henchman wheel around. Spats grabs the machine gun from the Second Henchman, and perforates what is left of Charlie with a hail of lead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toothpick Charlie crumbles in a heap. He is quite dead. Spats' be-spatted foot comes into SHOT, disdainfully kicks the toothpick out of Charlie's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry have taken advantage of this momentary diversion. Like scalded jackasses, they are sprinting toward the entrance, hanging on to their instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats and his boys pivot, see the two running. They let go with a salvo of shots, just as Joe and Jerry scoot through the garage door and disappear down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of henchmen start after them. There is the SOUND of an approaching police SIREN.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on - let's blow. We'll take care of those guys later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
They all pile into the black Dussenberg. The driver shifts into reverse and the car shoots backwards out of the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ALLEY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry come skidding around the corner from Clark Street, race down the snow-covered alley. In b.g. there is the SOUND of squealing tires and police sirens.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(as they run)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they got me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got the bull-fiddle.

</JOE>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling himself all over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't see any blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over. Type O.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
They start running even faster.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we running, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As far away as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not far enough. You don't know those guys! But they know us. Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the end of the alley. A couple of motorcycle policemen, their sirens wailing, flash by in the direction of the garage. The word must have spread, because pedestrians are also running in the same direction. Joe stops, looks around quickly, and seeing a cigar store on the corner drags Jerry inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CIGAR STORE - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hurries to a wall telephone near the entrance. Jerry follows breathlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a nickel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the saxophone case down, and taking a coin from Jerry, inserts it in the slot.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to call the police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.

	We got to get out of town. Maybe we ought to grow beards.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are going out of town. But we're going to shave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shave? At a time like this? Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shave our legs, stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Stupid is right. Jerry still doesn't get it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

(into phone; his voice a tremulous soprano)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Mr. Poliakoff? I understand you're looking for a couple of girl musicians.

<DIRECTION>
Now Jerry gets it.

:SC: EXT. CHICAGO RAILROAD PLATFORM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two pairs of high-heeled shoes, unusually large in size, are hurrying along the platform. CAMERA FOLLOWS them and PANS UP gradually, revealing rather hefty legs in rolled stockings, short dresses, coats with cheap fur pieces, and rakish cloche hats. One of the pair carries a saxophone case, the other a bull-fiddle case, and each has a Gladstone bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A train, with steam up, is loading for departure. Redcaps, passengers, baggage carts.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our two passenger accelerate their pace. But evidently they are not too adept at navigating in high heels. Suddenly the one with the bull-fiddle twists her ankle - or we should say his ankle - because it's Jerry. He stops and faces his girl- friend - Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(rubbing his ankle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
As they proceed along the platform, a gust of wind sends their skirts billowing. Jerry stops again and pulls his skirt down.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's so drafty. They must be catching colds all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With those legs? Are you crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
They are now approaching the Pullman car reserved for the girls' orchestra. Girl musicians, with instruments and luggage, are boarding the car, supervised by Sweet Sue and Bienstock.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no use. We'll never get away with it, Joe.

	The name is Josephine. And it was your idea in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a member of the girls' band comes hurrying past them, carrying a valise and ukulele case. Her name is SUGAR. What can we say about Sugar, except that she is the dream girl of every red-blooded American male who ever read College Humor? As she undulates past them, Jerry looks after her with dismay.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are we kidding? Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you afraid of? Nobody's asking you to have a baby. This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.

At one end of the car, Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators are beating out RUNNING WILD. It is a special rehearsal to break in the two new girls, Josephine and Daphne. The other girls, including Sugar on the ukulele, are really swinging. But Joe and Jerry are playing in a dainty ultra-refined manner, so as not to give themselves away. Sue, who is conducting from the aisle, raps her baton against a seat. The girls stop playing.

Sue is about to give the downbeat, when her eyes fall on Jerry's bass fiddle. There is a neat row of bullet holes across the face of the instrument.

She brings the baton down, and the girls start playing again. This time Joe and Jerry give it both knees - Joe going for a wild ride on the sax, and Jerry slapping and twirling the bass like a girl possessed. Sue cocks her eyebrows, amazed by the hepness of the two conservatory cats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now it is time for Sugar's solo. She steps forward with the ukulele, and starts to sing a hot chorus of RUNNING WILD. Holding on to the bull-fiddle, Jerry leans forward to get a better view of Sugar's backfield in motion.
</DIRECTION>

As Sugar shimmies through the number, the hidden flask slips out from under her garter, and falls to the floor with a clank. She freezes. Sue raps her baton furiously against the seat, stopping the music.

He raises the lid of the suitcase, rummages around till he finds a bottle of bourbon. As he takes it out, Joe stirs. Jerry freezes, raises the bottle up, ready to conk Joe if he wakes up. Joe turns over, settles back to sleep, and Jerry swings his body through the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, the bottle clutched in his hand, is hanging upside down, while Sugar in the upper berth holds on to his legs. As Jerry tries to raise himself back up, he slips out of Sugar's grasp, and sprawls in the aisle. He lies absolutely still, afraid that Joe may have heard him.

As he hands it up to her, the curtains of Upper 4 part, and Dolores, who has been awakened by the fall, peeks out.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better get some cups.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>

Jerry pads over to the water fountain beside the rest rooms. He punches out a couple of paper cups from a dispense, flits back to Berth 7, and scurries up the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dolores watches all this with great interest.
</DIRECTION>

Back in Upper 7, Sugar has already opened the bottle.

	What's the surprise?

They drink. The curtains open and Dolores, standing on the ladder outside, sticks her head in.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This a private clambake, or can anybody join?

</JERRY>
<SUGAR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Sugar. You're going to spoil my surprise.

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dolores has crossed the aisle, and getting a foot up on Lower 4, reaches up into her berth for the vermouth. The curtains of Lower 4 open, and Mary Lou sticks her head out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_LOU>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Party in Upper 7.

<MARY_LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARY_LOU>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And get a corkscrew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<DIRECTION>
Mary Lou gets out of her berth, steps across to Lower 3, wakes up Rosella.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Party in Upper 7. Got a corkscrew?

</MARY_LOU>
<ROSELLA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But Stella has.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSELLA>
<MARY_LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some cups.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_LOU>
<DIRECTION>
Rosella hurries toward the water fountain, while Mary Lou gets Stella and the corkscrew out of bed. Rapidly, the whole Pullman car springs into action. As silent as mice, the girls slip out of their berths, armed with various provisions. Their nighties billowing they scuttle down the aisle and up the ladder into Upper 7.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Upper 7, the party is building rapidly, as the mice pile in with their contributions.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the vermouth. I brought some crackers and cheese. Will ten cups be enough? Can you use a bottle of Southern Comfort?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRLS>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry is trying vainly to stem the invasion of gatecrashers.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, girls - this is a private party - a party for two - go away, no more room - ssh, the neighbors downstairs - you'll wake up Josephine - please, no crackers in bed - go someplace else, form your own party - be careful with that corkscrew! Sugar - where are you, Sugar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar is greeting Olga, who has climbed into the berth clutching a hot water bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<OLGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the cocktail shaker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLGA>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar starts measuring bourbon and vermouth into it.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy on the vermouth. If we only had some ice - Pass the peanut butter. Anybody for salami?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRLS>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(desperately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirteen girls in a berth - that's bad luck! Twelve of you will have to get out! ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Please, girls, no more food! I'll have ants in the morning!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Lower 7, Joe is stirring restlessly, while subdued noises float down from the party upstairs. The curtains part and Emily sticks her head in and shakes Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - you got any maraschino cherries on you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(half asleep)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>
<DIRECTION>
She disappears. Joe starts to close his eyes, then sits up with a jolt.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maraschino cherries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he becomes aware of the sounds of revelry up above. His eyes wide as he sees a girl's bare leg through the curtains. The girl steps on the edge of his berth, hoists herself into the upper. Joe throws open the curtains, sees several other pairs of girls' legs dangling down from the upper, and still more legs climbing up the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frantically, Joe jumps out of his birth. He is confronted by a sight which knocks into a cocked hat the principle that two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time. In a triumph of engineering, fourteen girls have squeezed themselves into Upper 7 - or to be exact, thirteen girls and Daphne - not to mention the bourbon, the vermouth, the Southern Comfort, the paper cups, the corkscrew, the hot water bottle, the crackers and cheese, and the salami. There is a seething tangle of arms and legs and blonde heads - like a snake pit at feeding time.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to find a needle in the haystack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daphne - Daphne -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(sticking his head out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Break it up, girls! Daphne! Come on, help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to tug at odd arms and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry pulls himself back into the berth.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, girls. You heard Josephine. Everybody out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar starts to back out of the berth.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not you, Sugar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just going to get some ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Joe has slipped on his robe as Sugar comes backing out of the berth and down the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out, out! That's right, Sugar. Now the rest of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
As Sugar heads for the water fountain, Joe starts to pull the other girls out.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, don't be a flat tire. Have a Manhattan. Come on in. There's lots of room in the back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRLS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ssh. Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry sticks his head out, looks after Sugar.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(plaintively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar - don't you leave me here alone, Sugar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar has pried open the panel under the water fountain, and reaching inside, drags out a huge cake of ice. Not quite knowing what to do with it, she thrusts it into Joe's hands, and turns quickly to the pile of instruments stashed between some empty seats.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(unaware of the cake of ice in his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, kids. Give up, will you? The party's over. Everybody go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly notices the ice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
By this time, Sugar has unscrewed a cymbal from the drum, and is holding the drummer's metal brush.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(beckoning to Joe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josephine, over here. Before it melts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
She heads for the women's lounge. Joe looks at her, looks at the ice, and not knowing what else to do with it, follows her through the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Sugar comes in, followed by Josephine with the cake of ice.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it here.

(dropping the ice in the bowl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better keep a lookout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Joe crosses to the curtain, peers out. Sugar, using the handle of the metal brush, starts to chop ice into the upturned cymbal.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not very bright, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why did you take this job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afford it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been with a male band?

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years. Oh, brother!

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't trust those guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't trust myself. The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo?

(abandoning his lookout post)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially tenor sax. I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me. All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

(hacking the ice viciously)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again. See what I mean? - not very bright.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olga is climbing up on the ladder to Upper 7 with the new supply of ice in the cymbal. The party is now really winging. Amidst the hushed hilarity, the hot water bottle is being passed around, paper cups and crackers are flying, some of the girls are smoking. Despite the absence of Sugar, Jerry is enjoying himself hugely. Dolores has the floor - finishing the joke that Bienstock interrupted earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>

To Jerry, this is excrutiatingly comical. He puts his hand over his mouth, trying to smother his wild laughter, starts to hiccup.

<ROSELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put some ice on her neck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a hunk of ice out of the cymbal, rubs it against the back of Jerry's neck. Jerry leaps up with a squeal, and the ice slides down into his nightgown. He squirms and wiggles, crying and laughing and hiccuping.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh! Aaah! It's cold! Owwww!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
The girls try to fish the ice from inside his nightie, and suddenly Jerry gets a new shock, worse than the ice. His hiccups stop, his eyes widen in panic. His bosoms have torn lose from their moorings again. He folds his arms over his suddenly flat chest, to ward off exposure.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>

With that, all the girls pounce on Jerry, start to tickle him. Jerry flops around like a fish, screaming and laughing and crying. In despair, his eyes fall on the emergency cord. He makes a grab for the cord, pulls it.

The girls heaped in the aisle are extricating themselves and scurrying back as fast as they can into their berths. Jerry scrambles up the ladder into Upper 7, pulls the curtains, just as the curtains of Lower 1 are flung open and Sue emerges. She glances up the aisle, which is now empty and peaceful-looking.

At the entrance to the women's lounge, Sugar has joined Joe and the two are peering through the curtains. The door of the car opens, and the Conductor runs in angrily. The two withdraw back into the lounge.

The Conductor joins Sue and Bienstock.

Through the curtains of Upper 7, Jerry's head appears timidly.

	Okay, Sugar - all clear. You better go back to bed.

He leads her to Lower 7. The curtains of Upper 7 are closed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can fall asleep anywhere, any time, over anybody.

He takes his suitcase out, stashes it under the berth.

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, honey.

<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(starting away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Sugar.

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
In Upper 7, Jerry is lying on his back with his eyes wide open, listening intently. From OFF comes -
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Josephine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry props himself up on one elbow, a smug grin of anticipation on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar gets into Lower 7, closing the curtains. Joe proceeds down the aisle, mounts the ladder to Upper 2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Upper 2, Joe closes the curtains, settles down to sleep. In the berth below, Bienstock is snoring away. Unable to take it, Joe clamps the spare pillow over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Upper 7, Jerry takes a long swig out of the hot water bottle to get his courage up. Then he parts the curtains cautiously, drops to the aisle. He leans toward the closed curtains of Lower 7.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(very softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe - are you asleep, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
In Lower 7, Sugar, her eyes closed, is drifting off to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry, satisfied that Joe is asleep, pussyfoots down the aisle to Berth 2. He listens for a second to Bienstock snoring, climbs up the ladder to Upper 2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Upper 2, Joe lies facing the window. The curtains part gingerly, and Jerry sticks his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>

Joe opens his eyes wide, and is about to turn around, but Jerry puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sssh. Don't move. It's me - Daphne. We don't want to wake up Bienstock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He slips into the berth, and the curtains close behind him. It's pretty dark now. Jerry stretches out on top of the covers, addresses the back of Joe's head. Joe, a grim expression on his face, is waiting to see how far Jerry will go.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; the big moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I promised you before - that surprise - well, I better break it to you gently. In the first place, I'm not a natural blonde - as a matter of face, there are all sorts of things about me that are not natural - you see, my friend and I - the reason we're on the train with you girls - well, you know those holes in the bull-fiddle - that wasn't mice - what I'm trying to say is - my name isn't really Daphne - it's Geraldine - I mean, Jerry - and you know why it's Jerry? - because I'm a boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He sweeps his blonde wig off. Joe, who's had enough, makes a move to sit up, but Jerry pushes him back gently.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't scream, please. Don't spoil it - it's too beautiful. just think of it, you and I - same berth, opposite sexes - male and female - he and she - the moth and the flame -

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel my heart - like a crazy drum.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts kissing Joe's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm mad for you, Sugar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breathing heavily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we going to do about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe has had it. Wheeling around, he grabs Jerry by the front of his nightgown, starts to shake him like a terrier shaking a rat.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; nonplussed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar, what are you doing? Don't get sore, baby -

Beginning to realize something may be wrong, Jerry reaches up and switches on the light. There is something wrong.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: EXT. SEMINOLE-RITZ HOTEL - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sprawling gingerbread structure basks in the warm Florida sun, fanned by towering palm trees, and lulled by waves breaking lazily on the exclusive beach frontage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wintertime and the livin' is easy, fish are jumpin' and the market is high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hotel bus chugs up the curved driveway toward the main entrance, hauling the Society Syncopators fromt he station. The rear of the bus is loaded with luggage and instruments. From inside comes the SOUND of girls' voices, singing DOWN AMONG THE SHELTERING PALMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the hotel veranda, creaking in their rocking chairs, are a dozen elderly gentlemen. They are all in resort clothes - white flannels, striped flannels, knickers, Panama hats, white linen caps - and they are all reading the Wall Street Journal. Their combined age must be about a thousand years, and their combined bank balance just about as many millions. As they hear the bus drawing up, they stop rocking, and slowly lower their Wall Street Journals. They are all wearing sunglasses, and leaning forward, they peer through them at the new arrivals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the driveway, the girls are climbing out of the bus, luggage and instruments are being unloaded. Jerry helps Sugar down, while Joe gets their instruments out of the pile. He hands the bull-fiddle case to Jerry, the ukulele case to Sugar.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the ukulele from Sugar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll carry the instruments.

<DIRECTION>
(to Sugar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't she a sweetheart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her toward the entrance. Jerry, loaded down with bass fiddle, ukulele and sax, glares after them - angrily, then follows them, balancing precariously on his high heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the veranda, the twelve rich dodos remove their sunglasses to get a better look at the girls. The one nearest to the steps is OSGOOD FIELDING III.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is a bit younger than the others, but that still puts him in his late fifties. He wears white plus-fours, argyle socks, two-toned shoes, and a gleam in his eye. He tips his Panama hat rakishly as the girl musicians mount the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Sugar come up the steps. Joe nudges her, directing her attention to the old crooks.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy-five. That's three-quarters of a century. Makes a girl think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I hope they brought their grandsons along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass Osgood Fielding III and start into the lobby, he tips his Panama jauntily. Then he turns to inspect the next girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next girl is Jerry, struggling up the steps, loaded with bass fiddle, saxophone and ukulele. He trips on the top steps, loses one of his shoes. Osgood jumps up gallantly.
</DIRECTION>
<OSGOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a moment, miss -

He starts to pull away, but Osgood holds on to his ankle.
</DIRECTION>
<OSGOOD>

	If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

He starts into the lobby, Osgood struggling after him with the instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY OF THE SEMINOLE-RITZ - DAY.

The lobby is very resort-y - potted palms, overhead fans, and a heavy undergrowth of wicker furniture. Osgood, balancing the instruments, follows Jerry in.
</DIRECTION>
<OSGOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.

He pulls out his bow tie, which is on an elastic, lets in snap back like an exclamation point.

	I'm tired of being a flag. I want to be a bull again. Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blow where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can we? We're broke.

</JOE>
<JERRY>

	We can get a job with another band. A male band.

	Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.

</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is so humiliating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you got pinched in the elevator. So what? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the beef? We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.

Bienstock comes in.

He goes out, shaking his head in puzzlement.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't?

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks. I'd rather stay in and soak in a hot tub.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps into the bathroom, turns on the faucet.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah - let her soak. Come on.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get burned, Daphne.

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He ushers Sugar out in high spirits. Joe looks after them, then quickly locks the hall door, and stepping into the bathroom, turns off the water. He hurries over to the bed, slides out Bienstock's suitcase, opens it. It's crammed full of resort clothes - and Joe takes out a blazer, flannel pants, and a yachting cap, which he perches on his head. Then he lifts his skirt above his knee, pulls out Bienstock's glasses from under his garter. He puts them on, peers around myopically. His enlarged eyes are grotesque - but then again, so is his scheme.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEACH - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the accompaniment of BY THE BEAUTIFUL SEA, several girls from the band, in bathing suits and caps, are running into the surf. The other girls are already in the water, splashing around and frolicking like a school of playful porpoises. There is no sign of Jerry. Sugar, standing up to her waist in water, suddenly lets out a startled SQUEAL, slaps the surface of the water behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daphne! Cut that out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry comes diving up, spouting water like a dolphin. He is wearing a girls' knitted bathing suit with a short skirt, and a rubber cap.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
A good-sized wave comes rolling in.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh. Here comes a big one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Sugar, holding on to her tightly. The wave breaks over them, sweeps them off their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strolling casually along the beach is Joe. He is wearing Bienstock's blazer (crest and eight gold buttons), flannel slacks (bell-bottom), a silk scarf, a yachting cap, and the glasses (which blur his vision considerably). In his hand he carries a rolled-up copy of the Wall Street Journal. He looks off toward the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls are scampering out of the water, and some of them start to toss a beach ball around. Sugar and Jerry come running up to the beach hand in hand. They take their caps off, and Sugar puts on a short terry-cloth jacket. Jerry jumps around on one foot, his head tilted, shaking the water out of his ear, then starts to rub himself off with a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(studying him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there's one thing I envy you for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so flat-chested. Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DOLORES_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out, Daphne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The beach ball comes sailing INTO SHOT, and Jerry catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Sugar - let's play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Sugar's hand, skips off with her to join the other girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, meanwhile, has come up to a basket chair nearby. Sitting in front of it, sorting sea shells out for a small pail, is a BOY of five. A few feet away stands his MOTHER, calling to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, Junior. Time for your nap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<JUNIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. I wanna play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNIOR>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of the corner of his mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard your mudder, Junior. Scram.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
They boy looks up at him, fearfully.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This beach ain't big enough for both of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy scrambles to his feet, and screaming "Mommy," runs off, leaving the pailful of shells behind. Joe settles himself in the chair, peers over his shoulder toward the girls playing ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls, Sugar and Jerry among them, are standing in a wide circle, tossing the beach ball around and chanting rhythmically: "I love coffee, I love tea, how many boys are stuck on me? One, two, three, four, five - "
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a wild throw over Sugar's head, in the direction of Joe's chair. Sugar turns and runs after the ball to retrieve it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is exactly what Joe has been waiting for. As the ball comes rolling past, he unfolds the Wall Street Journal, pretends to be reading it. Just as Sugar runs by, Joe extends his foot a couple of inches - enough to trip her and send her sprawling to the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowering paper; Cary Grant by now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My fault.

(helping her up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not hurt, are you?

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you'd make sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, don't worry. I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(returning to chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, really -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry and the other girls are looking off toward Sugar, waiting for the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sugar - come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar picks up the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(blase)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He buries himself behind the Wall Street Journal again. Sugar hesitates for a second, then throws the ball back to the girls. She steps closer to Joe, peers around the paper, studying him.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not very likely.

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you staying at the hotel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your face is familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must be it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(waving her aside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your view of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping at the bait)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a yacht?

She turns and looks seaward at a half-a-dozen yachts of different sizes bobbing in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one is yours - the big one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not. with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my flag steward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my cocktail steward. Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very interesting.

Joe resumes reading the paper. Sugar sits on the sand beside his chair.

	Up, up, up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be. Do you play the market?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - the ukulele. And I sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For your own amusement?

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're society girls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. Quite. You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Real hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, I guess some like it hot. But personally, I prefer classical music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do I. as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good school! And your family doesn't object to your career?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>

	You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before. I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very kind. I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What theory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

His words trail off as he sees Joe rise slowly out of the tub. The mystery of his quick change is now solved - he didn't change at all. He is fully dressed in Bienstock's outfit, and is clutching the yachting cap. As he emerges from the bathtub, covered with suds, he looks like some diabolique monster. He advances on Jerry menacingly.

On the bandstand, Sugar, backed by the rest of the orchestra, is singing. The girls in the band, Joe and Jerry among them, wear uniform evening gowns and long earrings. Sugar and Sue war distinctive gowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sugar's song is "I WANT TO BE LOVED BY YOU" - which she belts across in the style of the Twenties, complete with poop-poop-pa-doop trimmings. As she sings, she scans the room for her bespectacled Prince Charming, but there is no sign of him - naturally, since he is playing the saxophone behind her.
</DIRECTION>

In back of Joe is Jerry, thumping the bass grimly. He looks off, sees -

Osgood Fielding the Third, in a white mess jacket, sitting alone at a table. Catching Jerry's eye, he waves exuberantly, his face beaming with amorous anticipation.

Behind her, Sugar picks up her ukulele and the basket of flowers, tiptoes off the stand. Joe waves after her, wishing her luck.

About a dozen motorboats are tied up to the pier. Sugar hurries across the planking and up the stairs to the deserted pier, stops and looks around for her date. Behind her, Joe comes skimming along the planking on his bicycle, swoops under the pier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disheartened Sugar thinks that she has been stood up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe dismounts from the bike, ducks underneath the pier, and hops into the motorboat marked CALEDONIA. Straightening up, he waves to Sugar on the pier above him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahoy there!

Sugar turns, her face lighting up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahoy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries down the steps toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe suddenly remembers his glasses. He takes them out of his pocket, puts them on. As he does so, he feels the earrings. He pulls them off, shoves them in his pocket - and he's not a second too soon, for Sugar has just about reached him.

He helps her down into the motorboat.

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. And thank you for the flowers.

	It's the thought that counts.

She settles herself back on the cushioned seat. Joe starts fiddling around with the mysterious knobs on the instrument panel. He pushes, pulls, twists the knob - finally the motor turns over, but does not catch.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to be out of gas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, working the knobs desperately, does something right, and the motor starts with a ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He presses every lever he can find, manages to shift into gear. The boat backs out erratically. Joe shifts into neutral, but no matter how hard he tries to find the forward gear, he keeps winding up in reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.

(the old mariner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love it. Which way?

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?

He looks around, confused by the unfamiliar geography, then tentatively opens the nearest door, revealing a flight of stairs leading below deck.

	Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.

He closes the door, opens another one - it's a storage bin, containing mops, pails, coils of rope, etc.

Joe and Sugar come in, and as Joe takes his cap off, Sugar looks around, dazzled.

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's perfectly safe. We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the icebergs. But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.

	You're flattering me.

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean - like frigid?

</SUGAR>
<JOE>

	You mean you can't fall in love?

	Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too. That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no!

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk about sad.

	My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!

<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if you saw a good doctor...

	Don't talk like that. I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -

By this time there is only candlelight in the salon, and from the radio comes soft music - STAIRWAY TO THE STARS. Sugar crosses to the couch with two champagne glasses, hands one to Joe, sits beside him. Joe drinks down the champagne, and Sugar hands him the second glass. He drains that, too.

She kisses him, then floats through the entrance of the hotel. Joe watches her till she is out of sight, then takes off his glasses. He hurries up the steps, starts to climb up one of the posts of the veranda.

Jerry, still in his evening gown, is stretched out on his bed, gaily singing LA CUMPARSITA and accompanying himself with a pair of maracas. Joe appears over the railing of the balcony, steps through the window into the room.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry! You can't be serious!

</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? He keeps marrying girls all the time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're not a girl. You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?

<JERRY>

	Security.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.

</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say there is!

</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His mother - we need her approval. But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry - there's another problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been discussing that. He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're out of your mind! How can you get away with this?

</JOE>
<JERRY>

	Oh, I don't expect it to last. I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -

</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
	</DIALOGUE>

Jerry picks up a jewel box, opens it, hands it to Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gave me this bracelet.

</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe takes Bienstock's glasses out of his pocket, examines the bracelet through one of the lenses.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - these are real diamonds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally. You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.

<DIRECTION>
There is a KNOCK on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(in girl's voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute.

They grab their wigs, slap them on. Joe dives into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin.

</SUGAR_S_VOICE>

Sugar, in a negligee, comes in - or rather, floats in.

He opens a bureau drawer, takes out the hot-water bottle.

	Oh, no. I'm off that stuff - for good.

<JOE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It was suicidally beautiful.

</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he get fresh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around. You see he needs help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.

</SUGAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, I wish I'd been there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SUGAR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Daphne got a proposal tonight.

The door opens, and in strides the fresh Bellhop, gin bottle in one hand and the passkey in the other.

<BELLHOP>

Joe disappears under the covers.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY SEMINOLE-RITZ HOTEL - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are CLOSE on a doormat bearing the name SEMINOLE- RITZ HOTEL. A pair of men's feet step across the mat, the shoes encased I white linen spats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Spats Colombo entering the lobby, surrounded by his four henchmen and followed by bellhops carrying their luggage. The henchmen are all dolled up for Florida - knickers, Panamas, two-toned shoes - and one of them is carrying a golf bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats is somewhat more conservatively dressed in a light gray business suit. They stop and look around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Draped across the rear wall is an impressive banner reading:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELCOME DELEGATES 10TH ANNUAL CONVENTION FRIENDS OF ITALIAN OPERA
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading banner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends of Eye-talian Opera - hey, that's us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A convention official, wearing a badge and ribbon identifying him as a committee member, comes up to Spats.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Register over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
Spats nods to his boys, and they move toward the registration desk, past other groups of delegates. You would hate to meet any of these mugs in a dark alley, but what makes it heartwarming is that they all have a cauliflower ear for good music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on a settee is a gentleman reading the Police Gazette. As he lowers the paper, we see it's our friend Mulligan, the Federal agent. He looks after Spats and his boys with a wry smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the desk, Spats and his group are identifying themselves to the registrar. Leaning against a column, supervising the proceedings, is a dark, menacing young hoodlum, JOHNNY PARADISE. He is insolently flipping a half dollar in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
(to registrar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spats Colombo - delegate from Chicago - South Side chapter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
The registrar pins an identification tag on his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<PARADISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Spats. We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARADISE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wouldn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<PARADISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARADISE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we all got to go sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<PARADISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You never know who's going to be next.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(jerks his thumb toward screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Spats. Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARADISE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<PARADISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orders from Little Bonaparte.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARADISE>
<DIRECTION>
Spats has now been joined by the four henchmen, who have also received their identification tags, and Paradise motions them behind the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the screen, a couple of officials are waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put 'em up, Spats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little Bonaparte don't want no hardware around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
Spats reluctantly complies and the official frisks him.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay - you're clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
(tapping official's pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls an automatic out of the official's shoulder holster, tosses it into a wire basket which already holds a large collection of hardware.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The official glares at him, then turns and runs his hands down the First Henchman. He feels something at the bottom of one of his knickers, pulls elastic cuff. A gun drops out.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_HENCHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The official pulls the elastic of the other knicker, and several dozen bullets drop to the floor. The official kicks them away, faces the henchman with the golf bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<SECOND_HENCHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, number three iron -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The official pulls a submachine gun out of the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<SECOND_HENCHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mashie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spats emerges from behind the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<PARADISE>
<DIRECTION>
(still tossing coin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the banquet, Spats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARADISE>
<DIRECTION>
Spats looks at the young punk contemptuously, snatches the coin out of the air.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you pick up that cheap trick?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(drops the coin in the kid's breast pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
He and his henchmen start across the lobby toward the reception counter. As they pass Mulligan, he rises.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big joke!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? I was at Rigoletto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's his first name? And where does he live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an opera, you ignoramus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clark Street? Never heard of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cut myself shaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shave with your spats on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sleep with my spats on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit kidding. You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and who else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<FIRST_HENCHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_HENCHMAN>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Spats. One of these days we'll dig up those two guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
He leads his boys away from Mulligan toward the reception desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator door opens, and among the passengers stepping out are Joe and Jerry, in their summer dresses. Joe is carrying their room key.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating diamond bracelet on wrist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get it while you're young. And you better fix your lips. You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry stops, takes a mirror and lipstick out of his handbag, starts to touch up his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire. That's life. You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you giving me with the omelette?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nag, nag, nag. Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.

	Joe -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
What Jerry sees in the mirror is Spats Colombo and the four henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something tells me the omelette is about to hit the fan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods in the direction of the reception desk. Joe looks, sees what Jerry has seen, then -
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Daphne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
With as much grace as they can muster, they hurry back toward the elevator. The doors are just opening, and our Bellhops comes backing out, trundling an old man in a wheelchair. The old man wears a Panama hat, dark glasses, and is covered up to his chin with a plaid blanket. Joe and Jerry almost fall over the invalid in their haste to get to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) - DAY.

Joe and Jerry scramble inside.

As the elevator operator starts to close the doors, he is arrested by -
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry freeze as Spats steps into the elevator, followed by the four henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no!

</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be thinking of two other broads.

</SECOND_HENCHMAN>
<JERRY>

	Us? We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

Spats, his interest aroused, is now also studying the two boys. To their relief, the elevator stops and the operator opens the door.

He waves them away with the hand holding the room key. The henchman glances at the numbered tag.

As the elevator doors start to close, Spats glances over his shoulder toward the boys, frowning thoughtfully. In the elevator, Joe and Jerry look at each other, swallow hard.

As he and Sugar continue, their telephone conversation, INTERCUT between the two rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny - I never slept better. And I had the most wonderful dream. I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.

</JOE>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh - that kind of a merger. Is she young? Pretty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUGAR>
<JOE>

	According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so. But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no sign of Spats and his boys. The elevator door is just opening, and the Bellhop emerges, pushing the old man in the wheelchair. Joe and Jerry watch as the Bellhop wheels the old man into one of the rooms. They look at each other, as the same idea occurs to them both, nod their heads in agreement. Slipping out of Spats' room, they cross the corridor to the old man's room, start inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors open, and a Bellhop backs out with a man in a wheel chair. As they turn INTO CAMERA, we discover that the bellhop is Jerry - the uniform fitting him much too snugly - and the blanket-covered figure in the wheel chair is Joe, dressed in the old man's suit, Panama hat, and dark glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jerry and Joe proceed with dignity toward the front door, we see Spats and his henchmen deployed in strategic positions around the lobby. Jerry wheels Joe past Spats. Spats glances at them casually, then becomes aware of a strange CLACKING SOUND. He looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is something decidedly odd about the bellhop - because his trouser-legs terminate in high-heeled shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats, grinning smugly, signals the two henchmen who are guarding the front door. They start to close in on Joe and Jerry. Jerry abruptly spins the wheel chair around, trundles it toward the rear of the lobby. The other to henchmen take up the chase. Jerry and Joe disappear into a corridor leading toward the rear of the hotel. As the pursuing henchmen start to turn into the corridor, the empty wheel chair comes whizzing toward them. The henchmen stumble over it, become momentarily entangled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry, sprinting down the corridor, reach an open door, dart inside. The henchmen come racing up, and passing the door, round a bend in the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PANTRY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room stands a huge cake, and two convention officials are decorating it under the watchful eye of Johnny Paradise, who leans against the wall monotonously tossing a coin into the air. One of the officials, wielding a confectioner's cone, has almost finished lettering the inscription HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SPATS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry burst in from the corridor, and the three hoods look up, startled. Before they can recover, the boys have scooted across the room and out another door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BANQUET ROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry come dashing in breathlessly, stop to get their bearings. Dominating the room is a U-shaped table, covered with flowers and about thirty place-settings, with a half grapefruit on each plate. On the wall behind the head of the table is the banner welcoming the Friends of Italian Opera. The boys glance around the empty room, make a beeline for the main entrance. As they reach the door, it starts to open, and voices are HEARD from the corridor. They turn desperately toward a second door, but that too is opening. Trapped, they duck under the banquet table, disappearing behind the long white tablecloth just as the banqueteers start to troop in. They are the same mugs we saw in the lobby, but they are now dressed in tuxedos or white dinner jackets. Chatting amiably, they move to their places at the table.

Under the table, Joe and Jerry huddle together as the delegates start to seat themselves. Suddenly a pair of legs slide beneath the tablecloth directly in front of them - and the boys recoil when they see that the owner's shoes are encased in spats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats Colombo is settling himself at the table, while his four henchmen take the seats on either side of him.

<SPATS>

</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the half-grapefruit in front of him, and is about to ram it in the henchman's face.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_HENCHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, boss - we'll get 'em after the banquet. They can't be too far away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_HENCHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table, Joe and Jerry exchange a panicky look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a burst of APPLAUSE from the delegates as through the door strides LITTLE BONAPARTE, accompanied by half a dozen convention officials. Little Bonaparte is short, bald, vicious, and wears a hearing aid. As he proceeds toward the head of the table, his pose is Napoleonic -head bowed, hands clasped behind his back. Spats and his henchmen pointedly abstain from applauding. Little Bonaparte remains standing at the place of honor while his associates seat themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, fellow opera-lovers. It's been ten years since I elected myself president of this organization - and if I say so myself, you made the right choice. Let's look at the record. We have fought off the crackpots who want to repeal Prohibition and destroy the American home - by bringing the corner saloon. We have stamped out the fly-by-night operators who endangered public health by brewing gin in their own bathtubs, which is very unsanitary. We have made a real contribution to national prosperity - we are helping the automobile industry by buying all those trucks, the glass industry by using all those bottles, and the steel industry - you know, all those corkscrews. And what's good for the country is good for us. In the last fiscal year, our income was a hundred and twelve million dollars before taxes - only we ain't paying no taxes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
The delegates applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, like in every business, we've had our little misunderstandings. Let us now rise and observe one minute of silence in memory of seven of our members from Chicago - North Side chapter - who are unable to be with us tonight on account of being rubbed out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
All the delegates rise and bow their heads - except Spats and his henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues; sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, Spats. Up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Spats and his boys get up reluctantly, join the others in silent tribute.

:SC: INT. PANTRY - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inscribed top of the cake has been lifted off to reveal a hollow interior. Johnny Paradise is climbing inside.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy now. You know when you come out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<PARADISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. The second time they sing -

<DIRECTION>
(singing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	For he's a jolly good fel-low Which nobody can deny.

<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him a submachine gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't mess up the cake - I promised to bring back a piece to my kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny Paradise squats down inside the cake. The officials set the lid back in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
90. INT. BANQUET ROOM - DAY. 91.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The minute of silence is over, and the delegates are seating themselves. Little Bonaparte remains on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, fellow delegates, there comes a time in the life of every business executive when he starts to think about retirement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
There are ad lib cries of "No! No!" from the delegates. Little Bonaparte holds up his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In looking around for somebody to fill my shoes, I've been considering several candidates. For instance, there is a certain party from Chicago -

<DIRECTION>
South Side Chapter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances in the direction of Spats. Spats' henchmen turn and look at their boss.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now some people say he's gotten a little too big for his spats - but I say he's a man who'll go far. Some people say he's gone too far - but I say you can't keep a good man down. Of course, he still has a lot to learn. That big noise he made on St. Valentine's Day - that wasn't very good for public relations. And letting those two witnesses get away - that sure was careless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table, Joe and Jerry try to make themselves as small as possible.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about those two guys - they're as good as dead - I almost caught up with them today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on hearing aid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you let them get away twice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clicks his tongue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people would say that was real sloppy - but I say to err is human, to forgive divine. And you, Spats - the boys told me you was having a birthday - so we baked you a little cake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My birthday? It ain't for another four months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<BONAPARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we're a little early. So what's a few months between friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, boys - now all together -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For he's a jolly good fellow....
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
The other delegates, including Spats' henchmen, join in the song. The lights are extinguished, and from the pantry come the two officials, pushing a cart on which stands the cake, with candles blazing. They wheel the cake up directly in front of Spats, who eyes it uneasily. Little Bonaparte, meanwhile, is conducting the song with relish. As the singers reach the climactic line, the top of the cake tears open and out pops Johnny Paradise. Aiming his machine gun at Spats and his henchmen, he starts blazing away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table, Joe and Jerry cringe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bonaparte winces, turns down the volume of his hearing aid - he can't stand loud noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spats' four henchmen have slumped across the table. Spats is clutching his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<SPATS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big joke!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPATS>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes close, and he starts to slip out of his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table, Joe and Jerry react as Spats' body comes sliding toward them, feet first.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Jerry, pulls him out from under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The delegates, who are watching Johnny Paradise scramble out of the cake, are momentarily off guard as Joe and Jerry streak across the darkened banquet room toward the pantry door.
</DIRECTION>
<BONAPARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get those two guys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Four of the officials rush into the pantry after Joe and Jerry. At the same time, the main door opens, and Mulligan strides in. Standing in the corridor behind him are several frightened waiters. Mulligan switches on the lights, looks down at the five corpses.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MULLIGAN>
<BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
(blandly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was something in that cake that didn't agree with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BONAPARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Mulligan crosses to the cake, glances inside, then turns to Little Bonaparte.
</DIRECTION>
<MULLIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My compliments to the chef. And nobody's leaving this room till I get the recipe!
	</DIALOGUE>

<BONAPARTE>

	You want to make a Federal case out of it?

:SC: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry bolt out of the rear corridor, go pounding up the stairs, followed by two of the officials. As they disappear from sight, CAMERA PANS OVER to the elevator. The door opens, and out step Joe and Jerry, wearing their wigs and girls' coats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the boys mince daintily toward the front door, they see the other two officials coming toward them. They change their course abruptly. The first two officials come hurrying down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They slipped right through our hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_OFFICIAL>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>

(to Joe, in a hoarse whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He steers Jerry toward a row of telephone booths near the entrance to the ballroom. There is an easel sign outside announcing that Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators are appearing nightly in the Peacock Room, and from inside comes the SOUND of MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll I tell him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him you're going to elope with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elope? But there are laws - conventions -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(jerking his thumb over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a convention, all right. There's also the ladies' morgue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves Jerry toward a phone booth. Jerry reaches under his coat for a coin, revealing the rolled up trousers of the Bellhop uniform underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps into the phone booth, Joe becomes aware of the SOUND of sugar's VOICE drifting up from the ballroom. She is singing "I'M THROUGH WITH LOVE." Almost despite himself, Joe finds himself drawn toward the ballroom entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe appears in the vestibule at the top of the stairs, looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his point of view, we see Sugar perched on top of the piano, bathed in a spotlight. She is a little drunk, and more than a little blue, and she is singing the lyrics with heartbreaking conviction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, watching her from the landing, is deeply moved. Slowly, he starts down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One the bandstand, Sugar is winding up the torchy ballad, when suddenly Joe steps into the spotlight. Without a word, he takes her in his arms, kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josephine!!

Nearby, Sweet Sue is watching open-mouthed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	BIENSTOCK!

Bienstock, who is standing near the reservation desk, turns and peer myopically toward the bandstand. At the same time, two of the convention officials come up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - that's no dame!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
He and his companion rush toward the bandstand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bandstand, Joe is brushing a tear away from Sugar's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a male voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of that, Sugar - no guy is worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He catches sight of the two officials bearing down on him, leaping from the bandstand, shoulders his way through the couples on the dance floor. With the two officials on his heels, Joe gallops up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bandstand, all is confusion, as the girls stop playing and stand up. Sugar is staring after Joe in complete bewilderment.
</DIRECTION>
<SUGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josephine???

</SUGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly it dawns on her - that kiss! Her eyes widen, her hand flies to her mouth, and she looks with growing comprehension at the bracelet on her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry is just stepping out of the phone booth when Joe bursts out of the ballroom entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all fixed! Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not on the pier yet -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Jerry, and they take off across the lobby, as their pursuers appear behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys head for the front door, but finding their way blocked by the other two officials, they reverse their field and hotfoot it toward the rear corridor. The four officials converge on their trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Jerry charge down the rear corridor, go skidding around the corner. As the officials come tooling after them, two ambulance attendants round the turn in the corridor, pushing a wheeled stretcher. On the slap is a boy, covered with a sheet that hangs down the sides, and sticking out from the end of the sheet are a pair of spat-covered shoes. The four officials make way for this grisly cargo, then resume the chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the ambulance attendants wheel the stretcher toward the lobby, the trailing sheet lifts up, and Joe and Jerry, who have been clinging to the under-carriage, hop out. They tear across the lobby and scoot out the front door.
</DIRECTION>

DISSOLVE TO:

Osgood is waiting impatiently on the pier. He hears something, looks off toward the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry and Joe, still wearing their wigs and girls' coats, come scrambling down the steps, race across the planking toward the pier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the pier, Osgood's face lights up. Jerry comes puffing up the stairs, followed by Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's so eager!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSGOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Swooping down from the beach on a bicycle comes Sugar, pumping like mad. The bicycle bounces down the steps, and Sugar pedals across the planking, sounding her HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osgood and Jerry have settled themselves in the front seat of the motorboat, and Joe is getting into the rear seat when he hears the SOUND of the bicycle HORN. He looks back. Osgood starts the motor. Sugar comes racing up the stairs tot he pier, leans over the railing.

She kisses him resoundingly, bending him over backwards till they are both practically out of sight.

Up front, Osgood is blithely steering the boat, keeping his eyes straight ahead. Jerry is looking over his shoulder at the activities in the back seat.
