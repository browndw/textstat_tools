	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.

	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILTON>
<VENKMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This year? That's cutting it a little close, isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right? So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.

	I received this information from an alien. I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking. Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable torrent of disgusting ooze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC, and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain -- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad and eerie symphony.

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he can. He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end. Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting the pole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet. He jerks his legs up as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death. Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of the hallway. He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was unquestionably the worst presentation of a case I've ever heard in a court of law! I ought to cite you for contempt and have you disbarred. As for your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz and Egon Spengler, on the charges of conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction of public property, I find you guilty on all counts. I order you to pay fines in the amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to eighteen months in the city correctional facility at Ryker's Island.

<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And on a more personal note, let me go on record as saying that there is no place in decent society for fakes, charlatans and tricksters like you who prey on the gullibility of innocent people. You're beneath the contempt of this court. And believe me, if my hands were not tied by the unalterable fetters of the law, a law which has become in my view far too permissive and inadequate in it's standards of punishment, I would invoke the tradition of our illustrious forebearers, reach back to a sterner, purer justice and have you burned at the stake!

SCOLERI BROTHERS

<DIRECTION>
Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten feet tall. They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still attached. Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to get at the Judge.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were being displayed as evidence. They strap them on hastily as the Brothers continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

	Spengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and work them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on the floor.

	Watch it! I'm coming under you, Pete.
	</DIALOGUE>

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. Finally, Ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy.

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading. The man is played by Louis Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist, is playing his wife. They are both terrible actors.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to the slime specimen.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BLASTS from the speakers.

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet. She's wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby. She turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

BATHTUB
</DIRECTION>

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the bottom of the tub. Dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub. When she turns away, both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath.

DANA She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub. She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.

INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment. Venkman is asleep on the floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed just short of the bedroom. The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to his feet and answers it. He opens the door and sees Dana standing there. She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked, wrapped in a baby blanket.

	Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?

</DANA>

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom. The door is half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through the transparent vinyl curtain. He closes the bathroom door and looks at the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling off. Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

<VENKMAN>

	Nothing. They stayed there all night, went through your personal stuff, made a bunch of long-distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator. And didn't find anything.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection jars and photographic equipment.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of it attached to his utility belt.
</DIRECTION>
<STANTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand back.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them. As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt. Spengler lets go in time but Winston doesn't. He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow. Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in after him.
