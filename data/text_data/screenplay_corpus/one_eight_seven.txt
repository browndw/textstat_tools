<DIRECTION>
ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now to meet the bicyclist...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft. above the East River.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks back and forth as he pumps the pedals.

<DIRECTION>
FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour traffic on the bridge below.

A wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes as an "EL" TRAIN ROARS overhead. Trevor races parallel with it along Atlantic Avenue. Every city block becomes more and more rundown.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who are about to be tardy...
</DIRECTION>

The Assistant Principal, attention diverted, doesn't even notice Trevor as he enters on his bike and races down the sidewalk in front of the school. With all the prompting, students still don't seem to be in much of a hurry.
</DIRECTION>

With a glance over his shoulder, Trevor hops back onto his bike and pedals it down the middle of the corridor. STRAGGLING STUDENTS either ignore him or look at him like he's insane.

A crowd of 10th graders loiter outside Trevor's room. Seeing him coming, they stir to life with a flurry of taunts. Trevor chooses to face all dissension with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom door, he notices two lovers making out in the hallway...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, can I have everyone's attention?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
No response, but it doesn't phase Trevor. He removes the front wheels from his bike.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The purpose of the bicycle is to demonstrate the principle of centripetal force. That's the opposite of the force we studied yesterday, which was...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<VOICE_IN_THE_CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Magnum force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_IN_THE_CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Hoots and laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Centrifugal force... Centripetal force is where the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion is directed toward its center by an opposing force, thus creating momentum that constrains the body to its circular path. Like a gyroscope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sees nothing but yawns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better if I show you. Here, Tywan, you be my helper.

Tywan and Auggie are busy talking in the corner. They still haven't passed out the books.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tywan? Come on.

Tywan, solidly built like a Rodin bronze, saunters over.

Tywan sits and Trevor hands him the upside-down bicycle.

<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, hold the bike steady with your knees. That's it. Seat positioned against your chest.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll see. Be patient.

</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
A skeptical Tywan starts to crank the pedals, but he's not pedaling hard enough.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Put some muscle into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Tywan cranks the pedals harder now. Trevor back-pedals over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a physical science book (but doesn't open it).
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Keep pedaling. Harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
A paper airplane sails past an oblivious Tywan. He cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice. Now, he impales Trevor with a befuddled squint.
</DIRECTION>
<TYWAN>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whas up? I tol' you you was crazy, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYWAN>
<DIRECTION>
A thin smile of confidence from Trevor now...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now tilt the wheel to your right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the right, causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis.
</DIRECTION>
<TYWAN>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes wide like a little kid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, damn. I'm spinnin'. Lookit me, Auggie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor flickers a smile as Tywan's spinning starts to draw the attention of the rest of the class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Trevor refers to the physical science book in his hand. Smile on his face immediately fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: Physical science textbook. In magic marker. The large number 187 has been scrawled across every page. Trevor flips through the book. He checks the front page to see who it belongs to.

One of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers. The place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom.

WALTER (Anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle-aged counselor. A lifer. He chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances through a student "cum" (cue-mm).

<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(preoccupied)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty busy right now, Garfield. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor sets the book down on Walter's desk and nervously adjusts his glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you open it, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Walter opens the book.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shuts the book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have the textbook room charge him for the book.

<DIRECTION>
Walter snaps the book shut and looks up at Trevor. That's all?
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One-Eight-Seven is a penal code number for murder, Walter. Means the same thing as T-O-S. 'Terminate On the Spot.'

<WALTER>

(piqued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For chrissake, I know what it stands for. Look, kid probably heard it in a rap song. Doesn't mean anything.

Trevor exhales a sigh of resignation.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have him on a contract?

</TREVOR>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to Nixon, so what?

Walter's caught between a rock and a hard place. His instincts lean toward self-preservation.

	What's wrong with that?

Trevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as the passing BELL RINGS. Within seconds the corridor is teeming with teenagers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into SLOW MOTION now. MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind. His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis, Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a hundred times.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and sending the "187" textbook flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rams his weapon into Trevor's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS, filtered sunlight shimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward. A barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth and flesh. Trevor's backward flailing arms are ineffective in blocking the frenzied stabfest. Downward slashing, again and again... 10 times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aftermath. As quickly as it began it's over. Dennis Broadway slams open an exit door and is gone. Students scatter like cockroaches. An eerie stillness lingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor Garfield is lying on his back now in a pool of blood; black plastic framed glasses in pieces on the floor; lifeless arms spread out at his sides. His rheumy, unblinking eyes stare upward into infinite space. Breathing is the major focus of his concentration now as we SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his face. HOLD and now...

Glancing through open doorways. Observing the inner life of various classrooms in passing... sees students watch- ing TV, teacher ignores them.

INTERCUT WITH:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #3/COMPUTER LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the opposite side of the corridor... we can hear Ellen Henry's voice before reaching her doorway. All brightness and light, full of enthusiasm...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (like, a buzzer; times up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... EEEEgghh! Wrong. William, you know this. C'mon, how do you find the pound sign? What's the fastest way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see her through the doorway. ELLEN HENRY (TEACHER #3). She's thirty, Anglo, and non-tenured. At the front of the class ten students stand linked together, arm-in- arm, in a human chain. WILLIAM (15) sits behind a computer in the front row struggling to decipher the problem...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(playfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a major clue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout Binary search.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
William remains puzzled. The chain of students delight in chiding him. "C'mon, Beavis!"...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(the answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You split them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students with a double-handed karate chop. Fickle chain that they are, they resist.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Very funny.

Now a SLOW MOTION fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's passing gaze and openly smiles at him.

:SC: EXT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - BUNGALOWS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a MEANDERING COURSE, MERGING with Trevor now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Increasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the further one gets from the Main Office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the configuration of bungalows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... And Trevor's trepidation. Eyes discerning every passerby. His PULSE AUDIBLY RACES, senses heightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN... And the reverberating SOUND of a SPRAY PAINT MARBLE as Trevor rounds a corner and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets. One of the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow premonitory burn. The tagger has a "skin tight" (pelon) hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his neck. A barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi- fies BENNY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UTILITY SHED AND VICINITY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Behind the bungalows, adjacent the delivery gate. Meet DAVE CHILDRESS, a forty-something ditto-head. The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a cigarette before first period. He wears a faded Hawaiian shirt and Huarache sandals. An old military tattoo emblazons his left forearm. As he crushes out his cigarette, something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UTILITY SHED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Thru a chain-link fence we see a handful of cholo- types loitering around the shed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childress investigates. As he approaches the fence...
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hey, ese(s)?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain- link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the shed. Childress weighs an amused smirk. Now out of nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet. He scrambles out the back gate and is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound through a tear in the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. UTILITY SHED - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Childress pokes his head inside he discovers...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita Nartinez, seventeen... braless. A niobium belly- ring piercing her navel. She pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head. Glances up at Childress. Masks her shame with a defiant smirk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola, Rita's really nothing more than a little lost girl.)
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>

	What the hell's going on here, lil' sister?

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BUNGALOW "84" - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his breathing returns to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches the blackboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins. First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard. Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins to write per the file folder in his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER. SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S MARDSEN..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one pays much attention. Back still facing the class...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Before taking roll, I'd like to prove a point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Now one or two students begin to notice the indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...
</DIRECTION>
<BARSEK>
<DIRECTION>
(Armenian; a disparaging laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Farfie?'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cholo-like)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whad up, Farfie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARSEK>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans and expletives. With each subsequent stroke of the chalk he is exorcising his demons...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... It's not important what... or who... 'Farfie' is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Turning to face the class now...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay. Have a seat, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of students take their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(pacing now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point I'd like to make is this... Anyone here can be a scientist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
... a grudging buzz of confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<ASIAN_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto; puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What's he talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_GIRL>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... A scientist is like a detective. He investigates data. He scratches the surface of things he doesn't understand to see what's underneath.

	<DIALOGUE>
	... Things like this. Okay, who wants to read?

</DIRECTION>
<BARSEK>
<DIRECTION>
(standing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARSEK>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down" and "Armenian Power sucks"...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, we don't need disrespect. Let 'im do it.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<BARSEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barsek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARSEK>
<DIRECTION>
A wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of Trevor's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Barsek. Read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)
</DIRECTION>
<BARSEK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Glis was very frapper. She had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen. She couldn't galp a giberter for Farfie. Instead she wharked to plimp a mardsen binky for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARSEK>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, anyone know what Barsek just said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
... A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's alright. You don't need to understand something to answer a few simple questions about it. Every one of you is capable of decoding data. Watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor writes question #1 on the board...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1. WHY WAS GLIS FRAPPER?
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Why was Glis Frapper? Can anyone tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.

Asian Girl's POV as she studies the first two sentences on the board.
</DIRECTION>
<ASIAN_GIRL>

(slowly; cautiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Glis was frapper... because... she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You got it.

(reactions all around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try another.

Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. WHAT DID GLIS PLIMP?
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What did Glis plimp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho." Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head. Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(searching blackboard ledge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hold on, hold on. Where's your teacher keep the chalk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ASIAN_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... In the desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASIAN_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers. A startling discovery abruptly halts his search...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened. Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice interrupts...
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk drawer. You can hear a pin drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches Trevor.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I'm late. Had to handle something. You a sub?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>

<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought this was Science. Ms. Eskander.
	</DIALOGUE>

Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at Trevor's name on the board.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. This is Dave Childress, American History.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Don't know how to break it to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at Trevor's name again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Garfield... but this is bungalow 84.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you zigged when you shoulda zagged. Course it's not your fault someone jacked the number off my door. Keep askin' Garcia to fix it but all I get is 'nada.'
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing another bungalow across the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway as wads of paper intermittently zing past them.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... that mess over there, that's Eskander's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Trevor's unflinching stare...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BUNGALOW #86 - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bungalow was originally designed for lab science: glass-encased cupboards, a caged white lab rat on a side counter, an 8' by 3' counter top (island) at the front of the room, including a built-in sink and butane gas valve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students crowd the opened windows on the far side of the room. The chaotic atmosphere centers around one student... Benny Chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor's back to square one. He struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young black girl, LAKESIA STEWART (16), stands near the doorway. She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby (Education Now And Babies Later).
</DIRECTION>
<LAKESIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You our sub?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAKESIA>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor takes a peek at the doll.
</DIRECTION>
<LAKESIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not real. We're studying teen parenting in home-ec.' It's computerized, so it cries and shit.
	</DIALOGUE>

Crowd at the windows begins to disperse now, finding their seats, except for Benny who doesn't budge. Trevor approaches, gazes out the window, eyes sizing up the situation.

<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cesar Chavez. Don't you recognize me?

</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Class laughs. Trevor refers to the seating chart (inside the sub folder) in his hand but Benny's not sitting in his proper seat. Benny indicates a 2" by 3" monitoring device strapped to his ankle...
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See dis? I'm already on house arrest, homes. Ain't nothin' more you can do to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly three students across from Benny (the other three taggers we saw earlier, Cesar Sanchez, Stevie Littleton and Paco) stand with bold impunity. All are 17. Cesar has a buzz-cut, Stevie's an Anglo speed freak with a runny nose and a bleached one-clip haircut (roots showing) and Paco, a Latino.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, please.

Cesar, Stevie and Paco ignore Trevor and walk out of the bungalow. Their departure is accompanied by a tumultuous outburst of catcalls and whistles.

Benny turns his wrath on Trevor now.

	Hey, you ain't no real teacher. Fool, you're nothin' but a sub. T'ink yer so cool... You mus' be 'Mr. culo.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Scattered laughter. Trevor closes the sub folder and just looks at Benny.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you wear a rosary?

Trevor just stands there, studies Benny. A palpable beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
There is dead silence as Benny stares Trevor straight in the eye. Trevor stares right back.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jus' gimme a referral. Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor turns and calmly walks back to the island counter, searches and finds a referral slip in one of the drawers, fills it out...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cool deliberation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For future reference, anyone who disrupts a class, or in any way infringes on the rights of others to get an education, is subject to disciplinary action.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... hopefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect. This classroom is our sanctuary, yours and mine. Respect it.

</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, who would like to help me pick up the books?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Benny, a self-aggrandized exit, crumbles the referral slip and tosses it at Trevor, hitting him square in the back.

Like a reflex, Trevor whirls and ducks. Students laugh at his heightened reaction.

	You know what they say. Be careful what you pray for. Don't get me wrong, Benny's made my life a living hell. I even moved back in with my mother because of him. I love my mother, but if I eat one more dinner off a TV tray or watch one more rerun of 'Wheel of Fortune,' I think I'll lose my fucking mind.

Now an EGG TIMER RINGS O.S. on Ellen's desk. Back into the classroom...

Realizing now that all the CLACKING COMPUTER KEYS have stopped moments ago. All eyes are fixed on Ellen and Trevor.

:SC: EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - EVENING

Balmy and still.

ON bug zapper above garage, a churning, SLOW MOTION swarm of bugs repeatedly throw themselves headlong into the light.

:SC: INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC plays faintly on the STEREO. Numerous artifacts occupy the bookshelves. A primitive AFRICAN MASAI BOW (with two arrows) is mounted on a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor, tie loosened. Ellen, in nylon stocking feet, leaning back against a couch. On the coffee table before them are dirty dishes and half-full wine glasses. Trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(breaks the silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you ever get lonely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor considers the question.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes. There's this passage in God's Lonely Man by Thomas Wolfe where he says, '... The whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.' I believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ELLEN>

A beat.

</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
He offers a smile. Ellen returns it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're still there. Everybody around me seems to have given up. They're all so beaten down. But you're different. You refuse to be beaten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do you.

Kindred souls. Ellen fills her glass.

<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean where a light goes on?

<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Where the kid surpasses all your expectations.

<TREVOR>

	Yep, double standard... By the way, did you know Cesar Sanchez was Special Ed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Trevor shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D.

</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Severely Emotionally Disturbed... that's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then Ellen gets up, wine glass balanced in her left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Garfield -- on your feet. Lemme teach you how to Salsa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, I'm no good at that.

</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen spins the tuner on the STEREO to a LATIN STATION and practically yanks Trevor to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. Don't play shy with me, homeboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as Ellen walks him through it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(still holding wine glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it... Okay, follow me. It starts on the one. Step forward with your left foot... One. Change weight on, two. And three, feet back together... Now do the same in reverse, starting with your right foot.

<DIRECTION>
(talks their way through)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, two, three... One, two three...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor concentrates. Up to speed now. Technically he's got it, he just needs to loosen up. Ellen suppresses a gleeful snicker. Now, Trevor attempts to cut loose. He spins Ellen once, into a tango step, one-two-three. Now an awkward dip, causing her glass to spill wine down the back of his shirt...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified, giggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God... your shirt. Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(self-conscious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright.

</TREVOR>

He dashes toward the hallway bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab the baking soda outta the fridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
In a flurry, Ellen rushes into the kitchen. Flips on the kitchen light, jerks open the refrigerator and locates the baking soda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING now, as she MOVES STEADILY FROM the kitchen TO the hallway bathroom...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TREVOR'S - HALLWAY/BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Ellen steps into the doorway and lets out a startled gasp, dropping the box of baking soda.

Trevor is bent over, scrubbing his shirt in the sink. His bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal knife scars.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MOTHER HENRY'S - AFTER MIDNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tract house in the central San Fernando Valley. Trevor's Rambler is parked at the curb. The house is dark except for a porch light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever Jack, who's chained to the front porch. JACK WHIMPERS, ready to bark.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't start barking, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(petting him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey there, boy. You're a good dog. Yes, you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nuzzles up to Trevor, tail wagging furiously, no barking. Now Trevor stands and faces Ellen...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry for reacting the way I did back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't apologize. That's how most people react.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't scare me. It just surprised me. ... Thanks for dinner. I had a good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward silence. Trevor struggles with the urge to kiss her good night. They look at each other timidly for a moment. Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently adjusts her stance. The result is a kiss that doesn't quite hit her mouth. It's an awkward moment. Ellen feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange little plant by her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here... you need a little life in that place of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...

:SC: INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - AROUND 2 AM
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
madly pedaling TOWARD us on a bike. He wears running shoes, shorts and a Morehouse College sweat shirt and his face is contorted from the effort. He wipes sweat from his head, takes a gasping hit from his inhaler as CAMERA CRANES UP to reveal Trevor on a stationary bike in the back yard of his house, rapidly going nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His sleepless night continues. Planted at his desk. Trevor corrects a stack of science papers, like a fervent prayer. Sun peeks through the window above his desk.

It's sweltering. A single fan stirs the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst growing disorder, Trevor stands behind the front counter. AGENDA is written on the overhead as he flips through pages of a physical science text book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rita's out of her seat, feeding the caged, white lab rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar, with sunglasses and typical disregard, holds court in the back of the room. He and Stevie are high.

Trevor eyes them, finds what he was looking for in the book...

<DIRECTION>
Surprisingly, Cesar does what he's told as Trevor removes an old pocket watch from his briefcase and sets it next to Snowball's cage...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And remove the 'lokes.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar removes his dark glasses. His eyes are bloodshot and vapid.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice watch, homes. Can I have it?

</CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
Disregarding Cesar, Trevor opens a drawer and removes two latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box. He puts on the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rita, would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
She does. Trevor now removes a small amber bottle (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase. The class starts to settle down now as Trevor pre-measures water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>

At first Cesar doesn't budge. Now grudgingly he looks down at the book...
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
(attempting to read)

</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar heaves the book across the room: Class erupts, "Refer 'im," "Send 'im tuh Hyland." Trevor walks over and picks up the book. Class now settles. Watches Trevor closely to see what he's going to do. Trevor gazes at Cesar...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I say everyone deserves another chance. Whadda you say, Cesar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar knits his eyebrows, puzzled. Now Trevor walks over and sets the textbook down in front of Rita...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rita, would you please read Young's rule for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>

<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

Resume the lesson now. Trevor indicates the amber bottle...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... In the brown bottle I have a prescription for liquid Demeral.

</STEVIE>
<TREVOR>

</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar grudgingly watches as Trevor places a measured drop of the liquid demeral into the petri dish and stirs the solution.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Demeral is a morphine sulphate... and is soluble in water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Using the pipette, Trevor administers two drops of the demeral and water solution to the sugar cube, which he has placed inside Snowball's cage. As Snowball eats the sugar cube...
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young's rule says, divide the age of the patient by the patient's age plus twelve, giving us the fraction of the adult dosage suitable for the patient. In Snowball's case, I've calculated the dosage necessary to tranquilize a one-year-old child... then further divided that fraction by 30, based on his weight, to arrive at .002 milligrams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Having eaten most of the sugar cube, Snowball is rendered unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Don't worry, he'll be back to normal in exactly 10 minutes.

Trevor peers at his pocket watch.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RITA>
<DIRECTION>
Snowball isn't moving. HOLD for an uncomfortably long moment ON the class, clustered around Trevor's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The class, for once, is completely silent. Beads of perspiration form on Trevor's upper lip as he resolutely watches the sleeping rat.
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
(accusatory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just caught a murder case, homes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
Now Snowball begins to stir and the class reacts with scattered applause. A thin smile flickers across Trevor's face. As the BELL RINGS....
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, anyone who didn't finish answering the questions on 246, finish them for homework.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
As students head for the doors, he pulls off his latex gloves and looks for his pocket watch... but it's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it, Cesar.
	</DIALOGUE>

</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor nods, sustains an awkward smile.

Hyland rushes out and Trevor glances back at the index box. Momentous deliberation. Now he reaches over and carefully opens the small tin box.

One of the windows is smashed-in. A serpentine trail of BLACK SPRAY PAINT encircles the entire room. Provocative epithets tag the walls... "Pinche madre", "Puto" and "Fuck you G!"

	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
Profound silence. Grin dissolves. Riveted, Cesar takes another slow hit off his blunt. Suddenly a coyote darts past him.
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hells, man. Stupit dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
His sick smirk returns. But only momentarily. Now a premonitory flicker registers on his face. He blinks as a Masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left pectoral muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhaling a stunned breath, Cesar looks down at the arrow. An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls the arrow out of his chest and studies it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic needle. (The needle extends from a rubber stopper which has retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and into Cesar).
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mutha fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he turns and runs off.
</DIRECTION>

Cesar collapses onto a pile of garbage bags. MOVING IN. His eyes fixed and dilated. Forehead beaded with perspiration. Fighting against the effects of the injection...

Now blackness...

As Ellen returns. She notices the glass of water on the desk. Bravely collects herself. Crosses over to the desk and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Where'd you put the aspirin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what she sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters, Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO Ellen and her curious, sobered look. Now she slowly shuts the drawer.

Eyes feverish, registering pain. His head throbs. He begins to move and discovers a pounding in his right hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Lifting his hand up in front of his face. Cesar's ring index finger has been severed clean off. Blood is everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar emotes a silent panic-stricken scream. Reduced to a snot-sobbing wreck, he frantically searches the ground on his hands and knees...

THROUGH passing patients and personnel... APPROACHING the receiving desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... As the blurred shoulder of an orderly CROSSES OUT to reveal a legal-sized white envelope now on the counter top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A busy E.R. nurse notices the envelope. Glances around. Picks up the envelope and reads the name typed across the face of it... CESAR SANCHEZ... narrowing her gaze as she opens the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the envelope, Cesar's severed finger, nesting in a clump of newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Appears to be something tattooed across the side of it but we can't quite make it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse gasps and drops the envelope, spilling the finger onto the counter top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE now ON the finger and the fresh "tatt" scrawled across its side: R-U-DUN?

Scattered laughter and groans at this embarrassing routine...

Cesar's beaten gaze remains riveted to his book. Now he slides a look at the "R-U-DUN" tatt on his right index finger. The severed finger has been sewn back on, supported by a finger brace.

Class starts to buzz. Now a clicking frenzy to retrieve the same message.

The anonymous message pops up on computer screens all around the classroom.

The acrid fecal smell causes Ellen to flinch. Averting her eyes, she holds onto Mrs. Chacon's arm as they stand next to the autopsy table. A plastic diaphanous sheet covers the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the Assistant Coroner raises the sheet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Chacon's traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears. She raises a hand to her mouth. Now the tears come...

<DIRECTION>
(off Ellen's puzzled look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Following her gaze, he picks up the rosary beads. As he places them in a drawer in the credenza.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen's confused. Lost in a fixated gaze.

</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor just looks at her, a bated pause. Now he blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benny was no saint, Ellen. This is a kid who terrorized half the school. He even broke into your house. Maybe we should think about that 'fore we shed any tears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>

Ellen just looks at him.

Trevor accepts that it is.

He explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath- room wall.

Trevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all.

Childress laughs and chokes on his cigarette. Now he gazes at the .380 in his hand. Lost in a stupid, recalcitrant grin...

Childress makes his own momentous conclusion.

(almost exulted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really did it. You son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDRESS>

Awkward glint of admiration in Childress's eye. Leans forward, hangs a hand on Trevor's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You probably think you and me are alike.

<DIRECTION>
A clip from "Sally Jessy Rafael" or "Jerry Springer." One of those Sturm und Drang moments. Everyone points the finger at everyone else. No one willing to take responsibility for themselves.

Only partially watching the television. His eyes are fixed on a point somewhere in his own mind, lost to the world.

BACK AND FORTH between the mirror and Trevor. His eyes glazed and unblinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER INTO the parabolic mirror now. Breathing becoming more and more labored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a flicker, we're transported back to Roosevelt Whitney... Dennis Broadway's image SLOWLY COMING TOWARD us down the long corridor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor catches his breath and blinks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Back to reality. The mirror is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes his Proventil inhaler from his shirt pocket. Suppressing gasps, he takes two hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two girls at the magazine racks whisper to each other, eyes firmly fixed on Trevor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a presence at Trevor's side...

Rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right) eye where Cesar punched her, watches her two younger brothers as they fight over a toy truck. Her three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be carried) straddles her hip as Rita yells at the boys...

	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVOR>
<DIRECTION>
Trevor just stares at her, incredulously.
</DIRECTION>

Rita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye. Momentous deliberation, and now...
