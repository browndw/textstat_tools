Snow flakes falling against a black sky.

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM DOWNWARD TO REVEAL

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's A Wonderful Life". The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments.

INT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT IN SAME DIRECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES BEGIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening -- happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A customer says something interrogative to the bartender, who looks down the bar and shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into his drink. The drink is clearly not his first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black stubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santa staggers out the back door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom- pom out of the way, and vomits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street.

INT. SANTA ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An upbeat woman TRAINER presides over a half-dozen SANTAS sitting at school desks. On the blackboard the Trainer is writing out the sixth "Santa Commandment".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANTA'S TEN COMMANDMENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) No alcoholic beverages before or during your shift. 2) Know the names of your reindeer. 3) Do not smoke in your costume. 4) No swearing. 5) Absolutely no flirting. 6) Coax a smile from the child. 7) 8) 9)
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINER>
<DIRECTION>
(as she writes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coax... a... smile... from... the child.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to face them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, parents don't want photos where their child isn't smiling. Some children may not want to smile. It is your job to coax a smile out of them. A good line to remember is: "Santa thinks everybody should be happy. Can you smile for Santa?" A camera can only copy a child's smile -- it will take you to put it there.

one of the Santas (WILLIE). His HAND reaches into a boot and pulls out a pint of Smirnoff. We FOLLOW UP IN C.U. to see this hand pour a few ounces into a can of Coke he holds behind his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the child will not smile, the Photo Elf will go ahead and take the picture anyway. Now, it is a good Santa's job to smile as well -- I know with the big white beard your smile will be partially hidden, so you must learn to smile with your eyes. They show warmth and can be very expressive.

as he finishes off the can of Coke to REVEAL: his eyes colder than those of a dead fish.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember you have been chosen for the starring role of Santa Claus. Your portrayal of this beloved character will have a major impact on every child you meet. Keep in mind at all times that to them, you aren't a man dressed up like Santa, you are Santa.

Wintry night. Ray Coniff's "Jolly Ole Saint Nicholas" scores views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for the holiday. It is Christmas Eve, and the sidewalks throng with people rushing to do their last-minute shopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOTHER and her two absurdly bundled CHILDREN emerge from the crowd.

<DIRECTION>
The older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy-cane letter sign: TO SANTA'S WORKSHOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs and Mom shoos her younger child to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys cross the threshold of the gate and their eyes filled with wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A winding path cuts through a flocked and candy-striped forest, past a workshop filled with mannequin-elves busily cobbling Christmas toys, and finally arriving at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santa, seated on his throne like a scarlet Messiah. The younger child staggers forward to join the line of a hundred other leaky-nosed worshippers awaiting an audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted to Santa's chair by a smiling tiny man (MARCUS) dressed as an elf.

Santa turns to his Elf,

<SANTA>

	...That it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTA>
<DIRECTION>
The Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear. Santa pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne.

He takes a swig.

With the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - EXIT AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Downstairs the last of the store employees file out the door past an old SECURITY GUARD. Eventually Santa emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas, Willie.

</SECURITY_GUARD>
<SANTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me which way to have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTA>
<DIRECTION>
The Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM. An L.E.D. readout labeled "ARMING" counts down from 30 seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard exits the store, locks the door and heads home.

INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly -— it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alarm continues to count down -- 15... 14...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators. Landing on its feet, it barrels toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
10... 9...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Teddy bear scrambles for the door, crashing into everything in its path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
7... 6...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5... 4...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short to reach the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It raises the mannequin arm, using the pointed finger on its hand to press the "CANCEL" key on the keypad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to reveal his true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life known as MARCUS SKIDMORE. He is covered in sweat and panting like an asthmatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SHIPPING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hasp flips open and Marcus swings the door wide to reveal a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as WILLIE T. SOKE. He finishes the beer, crushes the can and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready.

The drill suddenly revs higher, getting Willie's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the track. He places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly and hits it with a sledgehammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the door swings open and bundled cash spills to the floor. Both men are impressed.
</DIRECTION>

Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the passenger seat next to his Pillipina Mail-order wife of several years, LOIS, who is dressed in expensively ugly clothes, and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney distaste.

INT. RATBAG APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm. He tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more and more aggravated until, finally --
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the clock debris.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
One final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt floating in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth.

Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street scratching his ass.

<DIRECTION>
Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key-box and moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp.
</DIRECTION>

He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps.

Willie gets in and drives off.

INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever.
</DIRECTION>

Nothing happens; no whoosh of rushing water.

Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off.

He reaches for another one and we see that on the bartop in front of him are neat stacks of lottery tickets as yet unscratched, and an untidy jumble of scratched ones.
</DIRECTION>

On the other side of the bar a MIDDLE-AGED STRIPPER vies for his attention. Willie's ticket hits for $5.00.

<WILLIE>

On an upper floor of Chamberlain's the theme is "The Desert as Winter Wonderland." Cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed burros are hitched to a sleigh. Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins. One in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero.

INT. BLACK ANGUS BAR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened-tie middle-management.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crammed at the far end of the bar, Willie stands out like a sore thumb in this thirty-ish crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a HINDUSTANI TROUBLEMAKER, sitting right across from him, startling Willie for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie regains his composure, then gives the guy a puzzled look back, and amused by the guy's unflinching anger, raises his glass in a toast to him as if to say, "whatever... cheers, you nutcase", and turns back to his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man stands up and, never releasing his stare, moves right up to Willie, two inches from his face. Willie looks up.

Willie follows the hand to find a mature but attractive BARMAID (SUE), an outdoorsy western beauty. Her eyes and Willie's lock -- a source of sardonic amusement for the troublemaker.

A wiry, hard-bitten, sun-baked saddlebag of a man, GIN SLAGEL sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless Pall Mall.

POV through the arcade's window shows Willie talking in pantomime to a young girl -- a very young girl -- at one of the pinball machines.

CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK -- the sound of many guns priming.

Police everywhere.

His .45 roars.

<DIRECTION>
The cops return fire.

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>

He ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gunfire fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie as the cops seek to put him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie reaches the end of the counter. A brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant. He dives into his Mercedes and peels out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street. Cops yell, draw their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and slues, and finally is clear of the pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, crank up their sirens and pursue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars.

EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and squeals braking into its driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. Cops leap out of their cars just as Willie jumps from his.
</DIRECTION>
<MEGAPHONE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt, put your hands up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGAPHONE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door. His voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone:
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up your ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He bounds up the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, boys -- nail him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A ripple of gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the stoop, facing the door, Willie staggers, rolls his eyes, and -- drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drawn by the noise, an adorable six-year-old in a nearby house slides open his second-story bedroom window to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS HIGH POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn, an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus, who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. His hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink elephant un-delivered...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The six year old draws in his breath and SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister who look, and SCREAM, with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat, Willie's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear kid. I hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood. The Kid's bedroom is no longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. We PAN OFF of it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a little bulletin board.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Anyway, just in case they took it as evidence I am also sending you a T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. I am healing up good and they tell me that I will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room. We TRACK toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Thank you for giving that letter to the cops. I forgot I asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or Santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. And now the cops know I wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked-up than Rodney King. The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. They are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Grandma is in the living room watching TV. We TRACK past her towards the Jacuzzi area.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...As for my little helper, I am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of the Jacuzzi. The Kid walks by her carrying a bucket. She tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by. He's never looked better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE TRACK TOWARDS THE FOYER. It's empty but the front door is open. We TRACK towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go out the front door...
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So I'll be staying in Phoenix now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. They're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so I'll see you when I come over to fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no shit from nobody. Least of all yourself. Anyways... see ya soon...

The Kid is dipping a toilet-bowl brush into a bucket of soapy water on the front stoop.

As the Kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood off the stoop, we see the back of his T-shirt. SHIT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PARTY NAKED.
