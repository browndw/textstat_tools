Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full moon.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The year was 1891. London was the capital of the world -- the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance. The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that had everything to do with one man. My friend, my partner, my burden...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the impression that he knows something that we don't.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Sherlock Holmes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sherlock Holmes?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway. The MAN takes a step into the road to watch him go --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious pursuit, Victorian-style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a 19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader, older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers: DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A thinking man of action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but not as fit as he used to be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers round the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying the lantern and a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the lantern away again. He peers about, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. First point of attack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400 fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's head is thrown back as he spins round.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker -- knuckles to liver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted thug and crumples him to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we can barely see what he's doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWACK! Hammer blow to ear. CRACK! Karate chop to throat. WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground, Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's goin' on, John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THUG>
<DIRECTION>
When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where we saw Holmes hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG, reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips him twice with his own gun, dropping him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and sniffs it appreciatively.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the crypts.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight. Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder. PULL BACK to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(The following exchange in whispers.)
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson. Perfect timing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice hat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just got it. Where's Lestrade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting his troops in formation. Is that your blood or theirs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It's an old shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left this behind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson hands him his pistol. Holmes looks at it with distaste, doesn't take it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Shall we?

This is what they do. This is what they like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together as they hear footsteps approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Des?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
He can see the hat, but not the man underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, s'me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson takes out the two men. He is more of a brawler, using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no less effective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a chilling sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner. Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has been placed at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony, shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if pulled to her feet by invisible hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some kind of ritual is about to climax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly, Latin incantation repeating and repeating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood simply ignores them. The Latin incantation never stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness, picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to plunge the point into her heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a rush of air departs the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face. His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark and cruel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Blackwood?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done, Holmes. And Watson as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost mockingly.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
That's more than Watson can take. He moves in to pistol- whip Blackwood --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood. Watson looks, sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost invisible --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the other end held between Blackwood's hands. A really nasty concealed weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a shame. That would've been fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his men finally appear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICEMEN flood the area.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

	It is.

<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should've waited for my help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a wry smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's still mouthing the incantation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you make of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon.

We FOLLOW a lady, MRS. HUDSON, walking down the street with the day's shopping. She picks up a paper with the day's headline "BLACKWOOD HANGS TOMORROW: CLAIMS PACK WITH THE DEVIL."

Watson heads down the hallway to the last door. A tendril of smoke wafts out from under it. Urgent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nonetheless, Watson stops, takes a deep breath, gathers himself. Something like this has happened before (is, in fact, Holmes' usual brand of chaos) the difference being, now, that Watson is sick to death of dealing with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which doesn't mean he won't.

Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head in, cautiously. He sees --

Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall.

	I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better.

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson hands Holmes the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park -- her husband has gone missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward pause. Cough.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Lewis is seeking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea. She is steeling herself for this interaction.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Watson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. I have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tea, Mr. Holmes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before him.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it poisoned, nanny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's enough of that in you already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to remove an old tray from behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HUDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's killed the dog... again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson jumps up. His bulldog, GLADSTONE, lies on the floor in a drugged stupor.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done to Gladstone this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes! As your doctor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be right as a trivet in no time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson's finally had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you have nothing to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you're free this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Royale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My favorite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary's coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not available.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're meeting her, Holmes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you proposed yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm still looking for the right ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
A little smile from Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's not official.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happening, like it or not. Half past eight. The Royale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
The dog wakes up and runs out.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And wear a jacket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson exits, leaving Holmes alone in his own chaos. For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE ROYALE - DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of information from the other guests. He notices the details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters. It all becomes quite overbearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already there.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes! You're early.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fashionably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I present Miss Mary Morstan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying. Holmes stands. She extends her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pleasure's mine. It really is a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes. I've a whole stack of detective novels at home. Poe, Wilkie Collins...
	</DIALOGUE>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can seem a bit far-fetched sometimes, though. Making these grand assumptions out of tiny details.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(livening up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take Watson...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... see that walking-stick? A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets... ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a wink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd keep an eye on that, by the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those days are behind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, right behind you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning in to Mary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's cost us the rent more than once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Mary laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know him. But what about a perfect stranger? What can you tell about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that's necessary --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I doubt --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it'd be wonderful. I insist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You insist?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at Watson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She insisted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(instantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a governess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well done. So shall we --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your student's a boy of 8.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie's 7, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine. Holmes stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's breathing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Mary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he's tall for his age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Mary nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He flicked ink at you today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there ink on my face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
The WAITER appears.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing wrong with your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gentleman has already ordered for himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Watson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would madam care for this evening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Watson gives Holmes a hard look: that's a bit much.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us a few minutes, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head, pours wine for all.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly -- which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes. Holmes pauses... pauses, then:
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were engaged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' mind has gotten away from him. He begins talking faster, intensely focused, manic.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to her feet. They're leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance... he died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Now she leaves --
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done, old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Watson goes with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high. The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt, spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLMES' POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly, Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving. The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING FIGHT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own blood from a split lip. It interests him. He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists together and moves in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLMES' POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's able to feel, not just think. He is utterly in the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning to move his head so that a punch grazes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely in control --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- until he notices a face at ringside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound floods back into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns back to McMurdo, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes begins walking away.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McMURDO Oi! We ain't done here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(walking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back of the head. The crowd falls silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes stops. Feels the back of his head, smells his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm. Plymouth gin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He turns. Steps back into the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible. As McMurdo braces for combat --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves, incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A full-scale riot is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the doors to quiet the prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who is frozen on the spot.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, what the hell's going on down here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from doing his spells. And now he's in some kind of fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard Captain continues around the corner. We see another guard, JACK, lies convulsing on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the prisoners in
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the cell next to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lot shut it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guards)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, get, down here and get him to the infirmary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The guards pick Charlie up and carry him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - NIGHT Blackwood sits dead center in the dark. Eyes closed, WHISPERING ungodly sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols, sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down cross. A hint of some method to his madness.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Blackwood, what's this all about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've a request.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GUARD_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't get nothin' `til you stop this devil nonsense. That's a holy book --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and you will respect it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood starts whispering FASTER. LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, you want me to muzzle you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the Captain starts COUGHING. He's confused. He coughs harder. Prisoners watch him stumble backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood keeps whispering. The Captain falls to one knee, keeps coughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prisoners start SHOUTING. The RAVEN at Blackwood's windowsill flutters away. Other guards run up, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him to the infirmary, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<DIRECTION>
Guards pull the Captain away. The remaining guard picks up the cross, stares at Blackwood, chilled. Blackwood's eyes snap open.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've a request.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING RING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fighting is over and the pub is closing. Only a few people remain cleaning up, mopping the beer and blood. Watson enters fast, looks around, and moves upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN. On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know this is for eye surgery?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find that it lifts my spirits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pathological amorbic process, it increases tissue change and weakness. And you know what a black reaction comes on you afterwards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is full of FLIES all buzzing about.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop moving, stick to the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(faking interest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? What about when you -- oops --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies. Holmes looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. Lestrade wants you at Pentonville Prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your job, not mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Blackwood's last request. Says he has information he'll give only to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
But Watson's already out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LONDON - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean white shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that structure. What has it been? Five years' work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
No reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of money.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary bet --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Holmes takes off his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right... I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Holmes pulls on the clean shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
	</DIALOGUE>

Watson's steaming. Holmes puts on his vest.

<WATSON>

	That's my waistcoat.

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops.

	Where are all the other prisoners?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands. There's something about him... it's like he can get inside your head.

</GUARD>

Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is.

:SC: INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - DAY Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting closer.

	How can I help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush --

</HOLMES>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all -- I am merely the channel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Despite the bars between them, the men are close together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.

Holmes steps back, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>

	I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords.

</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them. You must accept that this is beyond your control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought in your head.

Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and slides the folded paper partway out.

Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their footsteps clatter away.

Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene, finally prepared to engage with her.

He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond, Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears, delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style).

The gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on.

Even without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no woman in her right mind would go down this alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ALLEY The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to grab her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across the chin, dropping him immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys, eyes bulging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger. There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>

	Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look like yours, does it? And -- naughty boy -- here's another one. I'll return them, shall I?

He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.

He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews it to blacken his teeth.

Holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.

:SC: INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene's bag of money still sits on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is no mean feat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's intimidated, scared...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes motions to the bills.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, I've had just about enough --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarky!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Holmes, sir...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door. Breathless, pale, scared.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTABLE_CLARK>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Us means you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It appears he's come back from the dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTABLE_CLARK>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTABLE_CLARK>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson walks into his office.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not my reputation at stake here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you taking this seriously?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
They all move to the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Clarky laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money, and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes and Watson forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS KIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump of trees in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scotland Yard at their finest, once again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked. They'd rather be anywhere but here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE. Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is interesting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestrade emerges from the crypt. He is sweating, shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves it off.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at those slabs of marble -- they're half a ton each if they're a pound -- smashed outward like they were nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<DIRECTION>
On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes' handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Explain it if you can, Holmes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the coffin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're digging it up now. The witness is over there. You can question him if you like -- but you won't get much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<DIRECTION>
The old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of the rain under an ancient cypress tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson heads for him. Holmes disappears in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want Holmes or Watson to hear this.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
<DIRECTION>
(low, angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time! You're an embarrassment! Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. Are we bloody clear on that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<DIRECTION>
The cops nod, duly chastened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GROUNDSKEEPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse, looking in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth and gently sits him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in shock. We should give him a few moments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Lestrade stomps up.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at Watson, accusingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well? You pronounced the man dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(stung)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had no pulse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Lestrade shakes his head. It hasn't been a good day for him, or the Yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has been extracted from the crypt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin. They place it on the ground, step back, crossing themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OPEN IT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<DIRECTION>
But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches forward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood, in everyday clothes, with red hair.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTRADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not Blackwood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTRADE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(measuring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector, may I see your pen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned. Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth, revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Missing two incisors in the upper jaw...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a look at Holmes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adler's midget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All yours, Inspector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a small measure of revenge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt. Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<GROUNDSKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was walking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROUNDSKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
They all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in front of them, ready to unburden himself.
</DIRECTION>
<GROUNDSKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(quivering voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was walking but his feet didn't touch the ground. And I'm not daft, I know what I saw and I know Lord Blackwood. He was as alive as you or me. It's not right. It's not natural.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns, leaves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our Father Who art in heaven...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the game is afoot, Watson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes a bundle wrapped in newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along. Watson appears preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(mouth full, near indecipherable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson looks quite chuffed.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pawnbroker's marks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A PAWN SHOP. His face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The most recent is M.H...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maddison and Haig.

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE MADDISON & HAIG, PAWNBROKERS, RESPECTABLE, DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one thing you've missed. On the watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<PALM_READER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reckon your future, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALM_READER>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond.

</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you.

She grabs his hand anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<PALM_READER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to hear what I have to tell you.

</PALM_READER>
<DIRECTION>
Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of her tone that he doesn't pull away.
</DIRECTION>
<PALM_READER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see two men, brothers. Not in blood but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no... wait, a J.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you are clever don't you?

<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Watson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any changes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson shakes his head as he pays the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a new low -- even for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the wrapping aside, pleased with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you still have my cut from the fight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, do you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window: "Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes starts to look a bit nervous. As he follows Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PALM_READER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seen something in his hand. Darkness and great pain. Mortal peril. Warn your friend, he's not safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PALM_READER>
<DIRECTION>
Even Holmes is taken aback by this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LONDON EAST END - MINUTES LATER Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop behind them. Now Watson is smiling, and Holmes is not. Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes turns away, looks down at the TICKET he got from the pawnshop: an ADDRESS.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reordon's lodgings should be right around this bend. Here we are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He slows, looks up at a dark, dingy LODGING HOUSE. Some windows are boarded up.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh, well, give my regards to Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes heads for lodging house. Watson checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LODGING HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky stairs, finds a door with scratches on the keyhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock. It is fiddly. It takes him a while. He kneels to get a better angle with the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! Watson's boot flashes past him as he KICKS the door off its hinges. Off Holmes' pleased reaction, he gestures them inside.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can spare ten minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REORDON'S ROOMS - DAY The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms. Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior that stops them both in their tracks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew. Scrawled-on paper and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
They move further inside where there is a hallway and a basic bedroom. Holmes inspects it, moves through a door.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, come take a look at this --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson puts down what he was looking at, goes towards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REORDON'S LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, Watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(reeling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloody hell...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
The room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific and biological paraphernalia. Some of it gives off a distinctly electrical hum. Ungodly fragments of limbs and matter float in jars.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(inhaling deeply, loving it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ammonium sulfate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room, something ROTTING. An experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud of flies. Holmes and Watson step closer to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD FROGS. Eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies frozen in strange contortions, as if mid-death-rattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid perfumer. Watson does his best not to gag.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phosphorous... Formaldehyde... Hemlock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of BURNT PAPERS. He digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the rest. A CREST stamped on it, impossible to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has he any hydrochloric acid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson. Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another chemical on a clean sheet of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes senses something, moves into the next room. He stops at an open window, smells the CURTAINS:
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Irene was here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt paper.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. Something he was working on?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the lantern. Slowly, faint words APPEAR on the blank page. Ghostly chemistry. Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He worked for Blackwood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow. He starts walking back to the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one odor I can't put my finger on. Sweet, almost like perfume... or sugar....

BOOM! The door WHIPS open. TWO THUGS spill into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy).
</DIRECTION>

They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson. Holmes' eyes widen at the giant.

	Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man.

The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson.

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging at them. As they dodge and swing back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air, sending him flying into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REORDON'S LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler. Head butting one, kicking the other in the groin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade, which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REORDON'S LAB Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REORDON'S ROOMS Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement ring off the floor, just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson, knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by the efficacy of the weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson. Holmes cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS Dredger back twenty more feet. Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts running for it, frantic as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks at the sparking rod and races for the window as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as he's about to grab it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD! Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window. Watson picks up the ring, sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. TOOLEY IRONWORKS - GATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger runs down the street, knocking people out of his way. Holmes gives chase, darting around people, trailing Dredger through the gates of a huge commercial shipbuilders. Watson brings up the rear, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SLIPWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed to see it smoothly into water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - FIRST SLIPWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back around the shed that they just ran through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this network of struts. They weave through the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly. He takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile. A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FABRICATION SHED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson runs round the end of the building and sees Holmes scrambling under the half-built hull. Dredger in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - SLIPWAY A police WHISTLE echoes through the air. Dredger turns for a moment, just long enough for --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering another chock. It's the last straw for the support mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FABRICATION SHED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From his vantage point, Watson can see what's coming.

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship EXPLODE BACKWARDS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding down towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Holmes charges into Dredger again, pulling him backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his head, as the leviathan roars down towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over him. He's doomed. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the half-launched ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle and crack with the weight of the tethered ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The timber finally gives way. The ship is free again, falling through the air -- Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a sound like the side of the world being torn off --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a vast, frothy explosion of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds. A quiet beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet, but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of him and he sags back to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they find: Nothing. No blood or trace. The big man is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene. They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LONDON JAIL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change here and there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't slept all night. I deserve this... I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(theatrically indignant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self- defense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson shakes the notebook in Holmes' face.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and I've come to the conclusion that I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never complained about my methods before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>

<HOLMES>

	That was an accident...

<DIRECTION>
Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous- looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson snaps at the man.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who could forget that face? I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us!
	</DIALOGUE>

Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and drops Brownlee without missing a beat.
</DIRECTION>

	What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes' lack of understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson shakes his head in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Holmes. Not you. Me and her. You're not --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not human. You don't get it, do you? You are this...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touches his own head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... without this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He touches his own heart. They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<PRISON_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Watson? You made bail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRISON_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused. He steps forward. But the Guard shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PRISON_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just Watson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRISON_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- he leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary. She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson. The bars slide shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mob surrounds Holmes. He's never looked more alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LONDON JAIL - CORRIDOR Lestrade heads toward the holding room, flanked by prison wardens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door is opened, the thug blasts out backwards, having just been battered through it by Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing.

Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_THOMAS>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is on a roll.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as to the mystery -- the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place.

</HOLMES>
<SIR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, it's standard procedure, I suppose.

Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement on their part.

	I think we have the right man.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. They're almost interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<SIR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be as skeptical as you like -- but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries. The danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes.

Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems especially shaken.

Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the 1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN- YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.

	Wonderful. Case closed then. Your services are no longer required.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results? You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor perhaps?
	</DIALOGUE>

Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me who you're working for and what he's after.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's nobody's business but my own.

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I disagree.

</HOLMES>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, we are arguing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>

Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his case vehemently.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time.

Irene reaches for the wine.

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in over your head this time, Irene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Irene snatches up her gun. Holmes grabs her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe. Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else. Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that disarms Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kiss leads them to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>

Irene pulls him down to it. He doesn't resist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' eyes flare with surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK!
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock -- one in shackles, the other with the key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets off him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING. She's in charge now.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've NEVER been in over my head.

</HOLMES>

She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But free. And on my own terms. Just like you -- well, not you at this exact moment --
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>

She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but generally speaking.

Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his neck, moves to the doorway.

Sir Thomas enters the hall from outside, he looks tired. His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him.
</DIRECTION>
<PERIGRINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, sir. Some figs and honey with a nice glass of port? I've prepared a tray.

Sir Thomas sinks into his bath. Relaxing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic, as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up. Can't. Not all the way.

Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't fight it. It comes from a power greater than yours. You can only surrender.

</BLACKWOOD>

The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been imagining this moment for a long time...

The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.

<DIRECTION>
Holmes sits beside a COP, and opposite CONSTABLE CLARK.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely. This is why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling, there is no latitude for misunderstanding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>

He looks out the carriage window and sees signs of a spiritualist gathering.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith runs riot over reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a good thing she was offended or we'd never have found you. The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning.

The coach stops.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SIR THOMAS' HOUSE - DAY Holmes steps out of the coach, and is escorted inside by Constable Clark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've checked everything. No sign of a break-in. The Butler didn't hear anything. The body was in the tub, eyes wide open --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
-- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing Holmes isn't there)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- only his ring was missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTABLE_CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode. Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best -- this is, in fact, why he exists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you drain the water?
	</DIALOGUE>
<POLICE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of common decency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_OFFICER>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(incensed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up, opens it, sniffs it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<POLICE_OFFICER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhhhh... jasmine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_OFFICER>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's- eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill. Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances around the room, sees the chair where Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself. His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust. The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIR THOMAS' SECRET ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar, four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of paper, just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are startled by the secret room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea what to make of that.

:SC: INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS - DAY

Holmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door open. He is well into packing his things. The office is full of boxes, the walls and shelves are very sparse.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>

	Don't forget the wallpaper.

</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes steps aside. Two/three policemen enter carrying a large, heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on Watson's desktop. They unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of the thug from Reordon's lodging.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My new roommate. He's an inspiring conversationalist.

(alt: He has more humor than you.)
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's your friend from Reordon's. He didn't survive Dredger landing on him. Poor fellow. But there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body, starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and forearms of his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elbows and arms stained with blood, but older than his own injuries. Plenty of it, layer on layer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife, examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Though none of it human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to resist the mystery, but it's not easy.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A butcher perhaps...? What else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his nose at the smell.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his fingers like a connoisseur.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coal... river silt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson slows down further, struggling.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
A hanging beat. And Watson finally cracks, blurting out:
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine Elms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done. Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you?

</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson pulls it out of a box.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what Blackwood admits to owning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
As Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on his violin, thinking. Watson finds the page.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, Watson! This should lead us right to Blackwood.

Holmes leaps up and readies himself to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not us, you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>

This gives Holmes pause.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Well uh... best of luck with everything, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
A brief nod, then Holmes is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up, moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' PISTOL.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to himself, and sees their DOG giving him a disapproving look.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know. Don't give me that look, Gladstone.

He pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out.

A figure moves across the dark, Gothic courtyard. It is AMBASSADOR STANDISH. As he cuts through the shadows... A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised by the rain. He raises his collar, and keeps moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits the door to a building. It is locked. He bangs on the door, as the rain comes harder. The door finally opens. As he enters, we see the rain stops behind him, gone as fast as it came. A RAVEN flaps into the night.

The men in the room reel backwards, shocked, terrified.

Flames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a window out to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city blocks. People look up, gape, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage. Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flames flicker blinding white, as his body contorts, melting away. People scream, gasp, faint, cross themselves, as they witness this unnatural act.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS Blackwood turns away from the window, surveys them. They are terrified, but they are with him.

Coward produces a brimming silver chalice.

<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, drink your allegiance here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>

The members line up to drink from a CHALICE. It doesn't taste good, but it tastes like power. As they drink, Blackwood leans close to Coward:

	You control the police. Use them.

Coward nods.

:SC: EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just above the thump of industry we can hear a distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything all right, Captain Tanner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.
</DIRECTION>
<TANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little leak, nothing to worry about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very serious leak. He's soaked, and furious.
</DIRECTION>
<TANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a great one for the water, are you, doctor? Army type, aren't you? You wouldn't have lasted long in the Navy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope. He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<TANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's as far as we can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes starts clambering over the side. Watson's pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be fifty yards of mud out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the prow. He whispers at Tanner.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the police when you get there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears. Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind, watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know precisely how much money is in there.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more THUGS are loading the boat with something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance, where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes' GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing with my gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an honest mistake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was nothing honest about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing, the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's get this over with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one on the left seems more attentive, might prove easily distracted. The big one's been drinking -- whether for courage or from habit... Watson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun -- before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks. He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him. He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - TUNNEL

Holmes walks towards Watson who stands in the doorway, stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up, passing Watson into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it. Quiet:
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They cleared something out of here, not minutes ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes. You need to see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson, stepping into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now. An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I- beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled: 118.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One-eighteen. It's a date, a time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I am He that liveth, and was dead.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`And behold, I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death. Amen.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in the flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cautioned you to accept that this is beyond your control. Now you see the truth for yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely. Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes, as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to bear witness. At noon tomorrow, the world as you know it ends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls the trigger. Click. Misfire.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And because I appreciate your help, Holmes, I have a gift for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
(voice moving away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She followed you. You led your little lamb straight to slaughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial- strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking towards the processing line. Blades and gears and grinders churn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses with live flame).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then next carcass emerges --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled above her, her mouth gagged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense relief for a moment, then determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decision time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ASSEMBLY LINE Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly line towards the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes unties Irene's gag.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your turn in shackles this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this time no key, unfortunately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the next blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on a big canvas splatter cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been meaning to ask you something --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm a captive audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to Holmes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the flames hit them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he looks ahead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it all the way over --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the original speed, looks around for another possible off switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged into the boiling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes moving sideways, keeping pace with her.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying her best not to show the strain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past various obstacles --
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(same)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain you're not in over your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(panting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In some countries steam is considered excellent therapy for the skin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
-- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt, jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Holmes has Irene stable again:
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to say -- it's overrated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson yelling at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank -- and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson points at the I-beam running above them. Holmes nods. Irene sees it, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I- beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended upside down by her shackles and her feet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene. She swings off the I-beam, through the air --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal, facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of boiling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant- looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene rides the belt upwards. Holmes clambers the equipment, following her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt, catches up to Irene --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH. Whew!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps moving towards the giant band saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shit a brick.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sherlock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- smashes the shackle lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bandsaw whines viciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene swings aside, just misses it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets a free haircut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she can free her right hand (a move not possible with both shackles).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut- in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door, looking for Blackwood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you so much. I owe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
-- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson. Holmes grabs her, stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe me information.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more games, Irene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blackwood's manufactured large- scale weapons for years. Lately there've been rumors of something new. More powerful than anything else. And... magical. My job is to find out if the rumors are true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would say they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
And she's off, running toward the door. Holmes trails her, processing. They blast through the doors to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock. He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson. Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something on the planks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steel drums are dripping. A chemical. Holmes recognizes it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a trap and turns back to warn the others --
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
A metallic conductor SPARKS. Time slows. BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights up all of London.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is pushed back by the explosion as the rest of the barrels that line the dock begin exploding arond them -- it looks as it Watson hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is knocked to the ground by the blasts and flying debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally knocking him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover -- BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them down, but to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he opens his eyes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared. Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- is intercepted by Constable Clark.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTABLE_CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an order for your arrest all the way from the top, sir -- so you'll have to hit me now.

</CONSTABLE_CLARK>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>

Holmes cracks Constable Clark in the sweet spot, helps him gently to his knees. Holmes turns away, makes his escape fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes turns back to look at the explosion.

Mary returns past them, having unsuccessfully washed away tear-stained makeup; there is a smear on her cheek. The two coppers nod respectfully. Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room, reaches for the handle, pauses.
</DIRECTION>

THROUGH THE GLASS, she sees a white-coated DOCTOR, studying Watson's chart.

Mary stays at the door, unsure whether to enter or not.

WE SEE a newspaper on the nightstand next to a hospital bed, the headline reads: "AMERICAN AMBASSADOR STANDISH BURNED ALIVE!"

Watson is burned, cut, bruised, scraped, pock-marked with shrapnel. He mumbles inaudibly, his eyes still closed. He's delirious, sweating.

<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Mary's detective novels and magazines, coat, handbag, etc. already in the room.)
</DIRECTION>

The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.

We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the hospital is slumped down against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the Doctor is actually Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down, obscuring him --

:SC: INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes enters, disturbed, pained. Emotions swirling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone, hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12 o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock). The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross) then stands in the center of the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>

Holmes sways, fuzzy. He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man? He gestures towards the diagram on the floor.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting artwork. You look bloody awful.

</WATSON>

He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm is in a sling. He's been through it.

Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of him, sits opposite him with the other.

Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion. Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's observed over the course of the investigation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor. Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas' ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal. Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped cane. Next to the feather he writes America.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion -- he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big question mark. Where? Who?

Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang as if willing the flashes to come.

Holmes is excited, electric.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own.

	In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map!

	Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system.

</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map) draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>

Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room. Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.

<DIRECTION>
Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to, Sherlock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner turns the boat. Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson, did you bring my clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL. Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets it. He's never going to like guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starting early, aren't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
He offers the flask to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me, have a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
She can see this is more than a social invitation, she takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson, Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we doing in the sewers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY Expensive carriages fill the courtyard. The entire government is here. We see familiar faces from the Temple of Four Orders, heading into this epic building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEWERS - BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<TANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far as I can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought for him.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working their way around corners and through junctions back under the Houses of Parliament.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long tunnel to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it, a futuristic device:
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behold, Blackwood's magic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE. Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can tell that from here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I can tell it from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls something out of his pocket: the RAT TAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of the people inside that building --
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will be dead at the strike of noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the shattered ceiling, UP a channel, DOWN a bend, all the way through a GRATE TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Air blows UP through the grate. The chamber is now full of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats, Lord Coward steps up, checks the crowd. He sees a shadow up in the Lords' Gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEWERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven minutes to twelve...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the tunnel, faster and faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene trails them closely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt. It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They draw their guns. They burst into the area, completely surprising the three thugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson pistol-whips the nearest. Holmes front-kicks the next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns before he has a chance to fight or flee.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads straight for the device.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll keep these under wraps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson herds the three thugs away from the device.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson turns so that he can watch the action at the device --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- which puts his back to another tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife, looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE (where electric coils and circuits pulse).
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen anything like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's never been anything like it. A totally wire-free weapon. He must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by humming, sparking coils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes -- RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways, sending both guns spinning away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth- rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and Irene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes crushes the other's larynx.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Irene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes goes for Dredger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very emphatically.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_COWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_COWARD>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords' Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost. Blackwood is calm, commanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the doors as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEWERS - DAY The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect the device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to defuse it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard enough to dislodge some.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam as he loses air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine strokes left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger grins --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung with full force by Watson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson draws the sword from his sword stick. Deadly enough, but not very big.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe me for the ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more uneven than usual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the bullets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
BONG! The clock is ticking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his knife, pouring the gunpowder into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the bowl of his pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword from head to toe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword -- -- which shatters against the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer with a splash, then turns back to the device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOUSE OF LORDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked. Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of anyone going to open them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place. Shaped charge, Victorian-style.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need a light, a match --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle: her KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the device --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for long enough because --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three.

<WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES' GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the through-and-through) --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away, eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watson is face-down on the stones, still. The gun falls out of his limp hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade, redirecting the spark toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK! The shaped charge shears the steel rods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONG!

<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem surprised. Did you really take me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant? I see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption.

Holmes whips around -- sees Watson, seemingly dead. He goes to him, drops to his knees next to Watson, feels for a pulse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his face still pressed to the stones:
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty sure I heard the last chime.
	</DIALOGUE>

Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we made it. Just.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson rolls over, sits up. He's done, had enough.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this.
	</DIALOGUE>

Watson looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Irene?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holmes, I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Watson nods. He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness, face grim.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns, sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels and columns. She picks up speed. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM THE SIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood follows them. Sees something on the ground ahead -- pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous action with Dredger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood scoops it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn sideways to continue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head. The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into the pipe, into the unknown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PIPE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious breath the only point of reference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly claustrophobic as it gets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, almost imperceptibly, light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CELLAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PIPE - DAY

Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies TOWARDS us. An even tighter fit for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other -- reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this is a grind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full of construction equipment, and sees, yes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- more stairs, upward. The only ready way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the stairs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CELLAR - DAY -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY

<DIRECTION>
We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to maximum knee-buckling exposure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the (unfinished) window --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with scaffolding --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then the glory of London, the center of the world, laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --

And in that split second --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls, Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and KICKS DOWN and --

	I planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong... but now because of you thousands are going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before, his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self defense third.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I have to do is break this cylinder. The wind will do the rest. And you'll be the first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They continue to spar, now bound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood knocked from Irene's hand earlier).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a circle around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to Blackwood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking Blackwood around his ankle. Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes remains cool.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was never any magic. Only conjuring tricks.

</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.
</DIRECTION>

	Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(burial ground/ licking rocks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bath/Reordon flashback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained. That might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.

(Standish in rain/

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The death of Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid -- yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered your Temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Parliament/flask/ ceremony, dev ice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote -- at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
END FLASHBACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind whips harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops, hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to topple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another crane...
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut me loose, Holmes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at breakneck speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt. The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down, Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, the world will see you for what you are. Then you will hang... properly this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes through the floorboards --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see about that shall we. It's a long journey from here to the rope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
CREAK. Holmes looks up. Blackwood looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see about that shall we.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther... and finally --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see: the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a cloud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things that cannot be explained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Irene...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
His fingers move to take her pulse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes pop open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him. But this time, Holmes is ready for it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reverses the move, cuffing her instead. He takes a seat next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking out over the Thames.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like rain.

</IRENE>
<HOLMES>

</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
A bit of a smile and break.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were right, he is a professor. Moriarty. Key's in the watch pocket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close, near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and walks away. She smiles, calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll miss me, Sherlock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sadly, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword stick, keeps walking.

At the end of the top of the stairs. Holmes hands the Cylinder to one of the policemen.

<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't be by the time your boys get there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes keeps moving into the night. The storm curls around him, the rain falling hard. And he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of WATSON. Holmes can't help but smile. He joins Watson, no words spoken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick. Watson takes it. The two of them stand looking out down the Thames.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. 221 BAKER ST. - STAIRCASE As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger. Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.

<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still can't believe he's given us that ring.

Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a horrific scene: Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back to them. He looks dead.

	Don't panic, dear.

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson and Mary step in but do nothing to help Holmes.
</DIRECTION>
<WATSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself.

</WATSON>
<DIRECTION>
Watson pokes him. Turns him around.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on with it, Holmes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you manage it, Holmes?

</WATSON>
<HOLMES>
