Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain as Stump just stares.

Stump turns and steps into the open doorway. CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and barely lit. Taxidermied game hangs on the wall. Stump is terrified. A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news- paper. Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of place.
</DIRECTION>
<STUMP>

The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without speaking.

More CRASHING sounds from upstairs.

The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing.

ANGLE ON STAIRS Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just outside the half open door from which light spills. He hesitates...

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door. Stump is terrified -- he gasps for air.

	Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb, but I don't need this job that bad.

Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but -- ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP.

Stump freeses one more time. Silence. Then the voice --

POV SHOT - TY COBB Lying in bed in a robe. Unshaven. Bottles of booze and food everywhere. And bottles of pills sit on every surface. Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him. A small record player sits next to he bed. A record spins, filling the room with FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS. He places the gun on his night table, knocking pills and bottles to the floor with a crash he barely notices. When he speaks it is without a snarl, without threat -- simply, even sweetly, he says:

Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply, liquor spilling over him. Then, suddenly, he holds up his hand. A calm comes over him as -- He stares out the window into the snowy woods. His rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense, unsettling focus.

NEW ANGLE The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers -- and Cobb breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up slide. And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes across Cobb's mouth. Blood gushes. The ball pops free. Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at second -- he has bloodied Cobb's face. Cobb seems unboth- ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has stolen second. Both men seem satisfied.

nods, winds up, and as he does -- Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher digs in to take on Cobb -- Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm. A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe.

Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As the police rush out to break up the brawl...
