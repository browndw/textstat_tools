<MR_ZADIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. You are right. That's what's wrong with this club business. One day you are hot next day you are not. People get bored easily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ZADIR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know I had this great idea. You should make this place like a tropical jungle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, lots of silk plants and vines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but they're not real vines. They're bungee cords and people could like swing from one end to the other so if you left your friends at the bar, you could get back to them.

</DOUG>

Mr. Zadir is half listening to them as he drinks.

<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and the barmaids could wear loincloths -- but tasteful. Like the ones they wear in strip clubs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<MR_ZADIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could not insure bungee cords. People jumping back and forth. Too expensive.

	Okay. Hit delete on that one. Doug, tell him about your street idea.

	This is good. You're gonna love this.

</STEVE>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you make the outside of the club look like the inside. You know, you put down a rug outside and some couches and pipe out some music. People will love it. But, then on the inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this is the good part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>

<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Yeah, you know, if there were a big piece of glass you could put over the pool, you could use it as a dance floor. And it would be really sweet because people would feel like they were dancing on water.

	And you could put fish in the water and it would be like the ocean.
