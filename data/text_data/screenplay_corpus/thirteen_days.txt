EXT. STRATOSPHERE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glory of stratospheric dawn. The engines of a silver Lockheed U-2F rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet. Scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of sea far, far below. In the haze, the looming edge of land.

INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a giggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4. He's straddling and in the face of his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with a prodigious case of morning hair. Kenny awakens, red-eyed.

A SERIES OF VARIOUS SHOTS:

Photo Interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic viewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs.

Flying switches, flickering lights, humming motors. It's an eerie dance of technological black magic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side by side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare of the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMAGES FILL THE SCREEN

Aerial shots, flashing by. Cuban countryside from 72,500 feet. A MAGNIFYING GLASS swings down on its arm in front of us, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas covered OBJECTS among them.

INT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS

Kenny, briefcase in hand, weaves his way through the empty, ornate hallways of the West Wing. Past magnificent doorways, early American furniture, paintings. He finally reaches a doorway, goes through into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A long, narrow affair, window at the back looking out into the Rose Garden. Kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk, shucks off his coat, removes a folder from his briefcase, turns and heads back out...

<DIRECTION>
INT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

And into the warren of offices and halls that is the working White House. He takes a right, passes the doors to the Oval Office right next to his office, goes down a long, straight hall, into...

INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

The formal main building, the executive mansion. He passes the busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator. The doors close.

INT. 3RD FLOOR - FAMILY QUARTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR, the third. He heads down the long, posh hall of the family quarters. Fine furnishings, art. The living White House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded by a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. An agent opens one of the doors.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top o' the morning, Mr. President.

The figure lowers the paper.

It is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. He's wearing boxers and a tank top. Unshaven. Bed-head.

Kenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man, is his Chief of Staff...

A luxury hotel crowded with LOCAL POLS: the Democratic machine of Buffalo. Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling windows, a CROWD. The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s Americana. High School bands blare Sousa. The scene is deafening, boisterous. Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the room: fast, tough, on-the-go.

Kenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way through the crowd for a police car on a side street.
</DIRECTION>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's my favorite President?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Busy. But you've got his heart.

	Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.

<KENNY>

	Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.

</KENNY>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're giving the Brits Polaris instead. But a story'll just aggravate things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Scotty stares at Kenny, determined. Kenny looks away. And his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. She is talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. What they're saying is lost in the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scotty follows Kenny's gaze. Then the two men share a look, a silent understanding. Kenny glances at the Secret Service guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not today. He's got tight schedule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful Woman. Scotty acts like nothing has happened.
</DIRECTION>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it, Scotty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>

The formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear. He pretends to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you're in. Half hour.

Reston's won. But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel tough in the bargain. People like Kenny.

INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

In the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade goers. The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman. Disappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd. It's an eerie moment. Something troubles Kenny, and he glances up at the sky. A premonition. But it's a clear, clear blue. A day like this, all is right with the world...

Briefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and finds THREE MEN. Standing there. Thin-haired, bespectacled, academic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security Advisor. The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS.
</DIRECTION>

Kenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black display cases. And suddenly the world is slightly off kilter.

Kenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy. They head down the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail guarding the doors at the end. But the familiar route feels strange, and lasting an eternity. Kenny eyes the package under Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

WE ENTER from a different angle than we usually enter in movies: through the side door. The President's ornate desk sits on the right, windows looking out on the Rose Garden behind it. Kenny's gaze swivels to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM where the Interpreters, their crewcut chief, ARTHUR LUNDAHL, 50's, and Bundy stare at him. They're surrounded by PRESENTATION BOARDS propped up around the fireplace. The President's rocking chair and sofas.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You used to look down a bomb sight for a living, Ken. What do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
In eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way among the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects. It unleashes a wave of memories.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45.

They turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's younger brother/Attorney General, enters. Bobby shuts the door behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly grappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.

SWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS, CUBA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sweltering Cuban countryside. Shouting SOVIET ROCKET TROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNDAHL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our analysis at NPIC indicates the Soviet Union has followed its conventional weapons build-up in Cuba with the introduction of surface-to surface medium-range ballistic missiles, or MRBMs. Our official estimate at this time is that this missile system is the SS-4 Sandal. We do not believe these missiles are as yet operational.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNDAHL>
<DIRECTION>
A bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth. FILLING THE SCREEN. A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded cargo.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States, Cuba visible in the lower corner. An ARC is drawn clearly across the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNDAHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a 3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles. So far we have identified 32 missiles served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly all Soviet personnel. Our cities and military installations in the Southeast, as far north as Washington, are in range of these weapons, and in the event of a launch, would only have five minutes of warning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNDAHL>
<GENERAL_CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five minutes, gentlemen. Five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CARTER>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In those five minutes they could kill 80 million Americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases, degrading our retaliatory options. The Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move, upsetting the nuclear balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arthur. Are. You. Sure?

</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Lundahl looks around the room. Everyone is hanging.

<LUNDAHL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. President. These are nuclear missiles.

The men come to grips with their own fears, own anger.

General Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES:

EXT. FIELD TABLE - MISSILE SITE, CUBA - DAY

SCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table. A group of Soviet site ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground from a shaded hillock. CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and sweat in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>

	GMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days. However, a crash program to ready the missiles could cut that time.

Taylor sees the grim looks all around.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>

	I have to stress that there may be more missiles that we don't know about. We need more U-2 coverage.

</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny lets out his breath. He catches Bobby's eye. This is unbelievable.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at present, sir. But I think the prudent answer is we don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CARTER>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we have any sort of intelligence from CIA on what Khruschev is thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. President. We don't. We just don't know what's happening inside the Kremlin at that level.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CARTER>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They lied to us. Two weeks ago Dobrynin told me to my face Khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into Cuba. They said themselves, this is our backyard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
There's angry agreement. The President cuts it off.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, I want first reactions. Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start World War Three, what are we looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Rusk glances to his team at the end of the table. Ball, Johnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, I believe my team is in agreement. If we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a Soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate. The Russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want, wherever they want, and we're powerless to stop them. If they succeed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be Munich all over again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive. Confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter, allies will become unsure in the face of Soviet pressure, and the Soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder. We must remove the missiles one way or another. It seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit them. An air strike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<DIRECTION>
There's silence at the table. Some nods. Understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
And there it is. The clock is running.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir. We need to consider... if we decide to act, there's a good chance we'll end up in a general war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
The room falls silent. The President leans back in his chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny and the others watch him in silence. A long, dramatic pause. A course that will change history is about to be chosen. The President leans forward, folds his hands on the table. Fated. Grave.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's clear we cannot permit Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. We must get those missiles out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROSE GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the Rose Garden. The shock of the morning has worn off. The President stops, looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's going to matter what Khruschev's intentions are. I tell you, right now... I don't see any way around hitting them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
A long moment of silence as they move along again.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians, they'll move against Berlin. They attack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're at war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The guys stop again. The autumn day is bright, warm, alive. The air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train of logic for a beat. And in their faces we see that all three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its shadow over everything. It's only a couple of steps away. Steps that they're seriously contemplating.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in six months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Pained, the President turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if there are alternatives that make sense - and I'm not saying there are - we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other thing is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.

Kenny snorts a laugh. Bobby shoots him a cross look.

The President stops. Bobby and Kenny stop, too.

	Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kenny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule - your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bobby)

	Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing. Suddenly, Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Kenny! Who died?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a window. A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way it's going, the Democratic Party. DNC strategy session. If you can call it that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Scotty chuckles. Kenny moves off, leading him away. Kenny's assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>

Kenny tries to look him away.

	The number you asked for.

That shuts Kenny up. Reston eyes the slip, then looks to Kenny's face. And he knows something isn't right here.

	Gotta go, Scotty. See you tomorrow.

INT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car jolts to a stop. The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament revealing half of EXCOM inside. Kenny stands nearby waiting for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns: Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen, Stevenson, and Nitze. They're sitting in each others' laps, banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.

INT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

A steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel. It's the infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House. Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others.

<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out. It's too slow, and they'll have the missiles finished.

INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other EXCOM members draw near the board, its order of battle, strike maps. They're grim, but fascinated. Empowering. Intoxicating. Sexy. Kenny sees it in the faces, even the President's. Adlai does too, is upset.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still think there are diplomatic approaches we haven't considered yet.

	We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An invasion...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of general agreement, senses the consensus building and is agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at the far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary of State. He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dean. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.
</DIRECTION>
<ACHESON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option. The Soviet will only tie you down in negotiation, and leave us short of our goal, the removal of the missiles. Negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational, complicating the necessary military task we have at hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his presence overshadowing the room, oracular:
</DIRECTION>
<ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last fifteen years, I have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the Soviet. Gentlemen, I do not wish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity. A lesson I have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Soviet understands only one language: action. It respects only one word: force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny stares at the old man. Acheson's gaze finds his through the cigarette smoke. Acheson's eyes travel to the President.
</DIRECTION>
<ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I concur with General Taylor. I recommend, sir, air strikes followed by invasion, perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor nods, vindicated. The others murmur their approval. Bobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades a dire look with Kenny. This is happening too fast. Bobby holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it appears we have three options. Number one. A surgical air strike against the missiles themselves. Two, a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny eyes Bobby. Bobby is writing something.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And three, invasion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny, and REACHES BACK to him with a folded NOTE. Kenny takes it, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads NOW I KNOW WHO TOJO FELT PLANNING PEARL HARBOR.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're certainly going to do number one; we're going to take out these missiles, so it seems to me we don't have to wait very long. We ought to at least be making those preparations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny gives Bobby a curt nod. Bobby tilts his head at the President: pass the note on to him. Kenny rises, slips the note in front of the President.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The President unfolds the note, and we HOLD ON IT and his reaction as in the b.g., out of focus, Taylor speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, we're preparing to implement all three options, though I must stress again, sir, there are risks to the strikes without the follow-on invasion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Bundy clears his throat. Speaks from somewhere down the table.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to be clear, Mr. President, that we have definitely decided against a political track.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby. A beat, the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dean, how does this play out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<ACHESON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your first step, sir, will be to demand that the Soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours. They will refuse. When they do, you will order the strikes, followed by the invasion. They will resist, but will be overrun. They will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world, most likely Berlin. We will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there, defeating them per our plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what is the next step?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache. A dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:
</DIRECTION>
<ACHESON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hopefully cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
A chill runs down Kenny's spine. He looks in shock to the President. The President remains calm. But in place of the fated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEST WING HALLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Acheson strides down the hall, Taylor, Sweeney, Carter and Bundy swept along behind him. Bundy is on the defensive, the others grim.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If McNamara'd get off the fence...

</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<BUNDY>

</GENERAL_CARTER>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bombing them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<ACHESON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember that the Kennedys' father was one of the architects of Munich. The General is right. There is only one responsible choice here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<DIRECTION>
Bundy just nods. Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson.
</DIRECTION>
<ACHESON>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's pray appeasement doesn't run in families. I fear weakness does.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimacing in pain. He opens a pill bottle, takes two pills out. He takes a whiskey in a shot glass from Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff. He eases into his rocking chair. Bobby lies sprawled on the couch. Kenny sits down. They all look at each other. A beat, something like shock.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ Almighty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
They burst out laughing. An absurd, tension draining moment. They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills.

	Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.

	Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing is, Acheson's right. Talk alone won't accomplish anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says:
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's bomb the shit out of them. Everyone wants to, even you, even me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(there's a point)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sure would feel good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional response, not necessarily the intelligent one.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain. Kenny and Bobby aver their eyes. When it passes, the President is hushed, grave.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny nods, moved. The President reaches out for the reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through. Bobby hands them to him. The President looks them over. And when he speaks, there's humility. And resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't let things get ahead of themselves. We've got to control what happens. We're going to do what we have to make this come out right. EXCOM is our first weapon.

EXT. AIRPORT - BRIDGEPOINT, CONNECTICUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH. DAY 2
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed platform. The President, barely recognizable at the distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to work today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes nuts. Kenny paces, checks his watch, impatient to be done with the necessary diversion. Kenny gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with half the White House press corps suckered along. Scotty catches Kenny's look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over. The President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<DIRECTION>
But Kenny stands there, mute. Reston just shakes his head, knowing for sure something's up. He turns and heads back for the press corps.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential plane, the crowd cheering him. He gives a final wave.

	Let's get out of here.

INT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the State Department. Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head of the table, very, very alone. All eyes are on him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. No. There is more than one option here. If one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
McNamara squirms. The others react in frustration. CIA chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank God when it's clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're talking about a sneak attack! How'll that make us look? Big country blasting a little one into the stone age. We'll be real favorites around the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<ACHESON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bobby, that's naive. This is the real world, you know that better than anybody. Your argument is ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACHESON>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing Castro over at CIA.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
And there's nothing Bobby can say to that. He props himself up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its shiny surface somewhere. There is only the reflection of his own face.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let my brother go down in History like a villain, like a Tojo, ordering another Pearl Harbor.
	</DIALOGUE>

McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look. The last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling. Finally, Bobby looks up at McNamara.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it to me.

McNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table, weighing the situation out. And finally he ventures.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six months ago we gamed out a scenario. It's slow. It doesn't get rid of the missiles. There are a lot of drawbacks.
	</DIALOGUE>

	The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba.

SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18TH. DAY 3

<DIRECTION>
INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a debate. Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor, General Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The situation is worse than we thought. We count 40 missiles now, longer range IRBMs. They can hit every city in the continental U.S.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps, that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and McNamara. The pressure from the military is almost physical.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the air strikes. All you have to do is give me the word, sir, and my boys will get those Red bastards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
The President continues staring out the window. Kenny eases over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing himself between the President and the soldiers. Bobby joins him, side-by-side.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long until the army is ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can begin the strikes, now. The plans call for an eight-day air campaign. It'd light a fire under the army's ass to get in place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
That makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General LeMay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, I believe it is the only course of action. American is in danger. Those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent. Without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war. It's our duty, our responsibility to the American people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation. The Big Red Dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
Taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational. The other options...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
He spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms folded, serious.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee. However, the more time that goes by, the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
The President, partially defused, looks from Taylor to McNamara. LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC is 'Peace is our Profession.' God forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange. But if launched, those missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of Americans. That's why I'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them. Destroying them immediately. Hell, even Mac agrees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
Bundy is uncomfortable. Everyone turns to him. He nods. Kenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military. McNamara does too, lets out a deep breath. The President eyes Bundy, then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General, what will the Soviets do when we attack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to believe what they just heard.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Because the only alternative open to them is one they can't choose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those aren't just missiles we'll be destroying. We kill Soviet soldiers, and they will respond. How would we respond if they killed ours? No, they will do something, General, I promise you that. And I believe it'll be Berlin.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and their staffers.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those goddamn Kennedys are going to destroy this country if we don't do something about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<DIRECTION>
There are dark looks on the faces of the other officers. They agree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the meeting next door disperses, the President rummages through Kenny's jacket which hangs on Kenny's chair. Kenny, bemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the President is looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping LeMay pushed you. I wouldn't mind going a few rounds with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The President glances up, takes the proffered smokes.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We knew it was coming. I tell you, Kenny, these brass hats have one big advantage. We do what they want us to, none of us will be alive to tell 'em they were wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<SORENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his way by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORENSEN>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to go over what you're going to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.

</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEST WING HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the crewcut, bullet-headed Press Secretary, PIERRE SALINGER, in the crowded, busy hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<SALINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenny, I'm getting funny questions from the guys in the press office. As Press Secretary, I need to know. What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny wheels back into his office. It's filled with people. But he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're planning to shave you bald next time you fall asleep on the bus.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Pierre's get-serious look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office, waiting for the Gromyko photo-op. Kenny stands shoulder-to shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RESTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they going to discuss the military exercises going on in Florida?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESTON>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at hiding his reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Scotty. This meeting's been on the books for months. It's just a friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Fortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
over the reporters. The President, unsmiling, enters the room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO. Gromyko pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny reacts. At last, the face of the enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has gone long. The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing in the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his chair across from Gromyko on the sofa. Rusk, Ambassador ANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that there should be no misunderstanding, the position of the United States, which has been made clear by the Attorney General to Ambassador Dobrynin here, I shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated September 13th.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in Cuba, it would present the gravest threat to U.S. national security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes translating. Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold, unreadable. The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English.
</DIRECTION>
<GROMYKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, this will never be done. You need not be concerned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROMYKO>
<DIRECTION>
The President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his glasses, asks:
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I do not misunderstand you: there are no offensive weapons in Cuba.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:
</DIRECTION>
<GROMYKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. President. We have sent defensive weapons only to Cuba.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROMYKO>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of Gromyko's head. His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny emerges from his office. The Soviet delegation disappears down the hallway with Rusk. Kenny turns as Bobby, haggard, comes up from the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being HARANGUED OC by the press.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?

<DIRECTION>
The President comes out of the next door down the hall, the Oval Office. He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby. He's livid.

<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.

</THE_PRESIDENT>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I can't?

</BOBBY>
<KENNY>

The prospect disturbs the three men.

<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?

Kenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of the hotel they've taken over. From one of the rooms emerges Salinger.
</DIRECTION>
<SALINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenny, all right. What's going on here? There's rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to Cuba. I'm the Press Secretary. I can't do my job if I don't know what's going on. So what's going on?

INT. RECEPTION HALL - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner band's tunes. The President and Chicago MAYOR RICHARD DALY make the rounds among the fund raising CROWD. Kenny follows them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies.

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a MESSENGER hustles over to Kenny, hands him a note. Kenny makes eye contact with the President, nods and leaves.

INT. HOTEL ELEVATORS - NIGHT

Kenny waits at the elevator. Scotty saunters up behind him. He sizes Kenny up, clears his throat. Kenny turns around.

<KENNY>

	Cuba? You're fucking crazy. We are not invading Cuba. Nobody gives a rat's ass about Cuba. Not now, not ever. If you print something like that, all you're going to do is inflame the situation. Nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations. Assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop.

Reston is taken aback. Stung silence for a beat. Kenny's response is far louder than any "yes." Now Kenny realizes it.

The President emerges from the hotel, a HAT on his head. The Press and a CROWD surge forward, crying out for the President's attention. Kenny slides into the limo first as the President waves to the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salinger waits on the sidewalk, and after the limo pulls away, the Press pushes in on him. Pierre's face is pale - he's just been told everything.

The White House Oval ROOM: opulent, filled with priceless art and furniture, but cramped. EXCOM members crowd around the center coffee table and the President. Kenny stands behind him with Bobby. Rusk rises from his seat, formal.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that, for the moment, a blockade of offensive weapons to Cuba is our best option. But we'll still need a strong showing of support from the Organization of American States to give us an umbrella of legitimacy.

</RUSK>

At long last... Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved. They've bought time to find a settlement. Bobby smiles a small smile: what were you so worried about?

The President. He listens, looks over the briefing papers as McNamara continues. Everyone watches the President.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A quarantine prevents more missiles from reaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the ones already there. It gives the Soviets a chance to pull back without war. If they refuse to remove the missiles before they're operational, we retain the option to strike or invade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We believe that a surprise attack would be counter to what the United States stands for. We believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver, and the inevitable Soviet response will force us into a war we do not want. A war that, this time, will really end all war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes. With the blockade, we lose strategic surprise and we run the risk of a first strike if the Soviets decide they have to use the missiles or lose them.

	So I guess I'll be. Our third choice is to cut a deal. We trade Guantanamo and our missiles in Turkey, get them to pull their missiles out. We employ a back channel, attribute the idea to U Thant. U Thant then raises it at the U.N.

Adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony gazes. From McCone and General Taylor, contempt. Dead silence for a long, long beat.

Kenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man commit political suicide. Even Sorensen, standing behind him, unconsciously moves away. At last the President speaks.

A crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his patio. Kenny steps INTO FRAME. He looks at the PARTYGOERS, the Washington social set. He stands out, oppressed by the knowledge he's unable to share. He takes a stiff drink.

Suddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand. Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him.

Kenny shrugs. Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes.

AVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded Sunday mass. Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left.

The President sits nearby, head bowed. But Kenny knows he's not thinking about the mass. And when the President at last lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise.

Kenny, Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and half of EXCOM stand to the side of the room. General Sweeney and LeMay stand in front of the President's desk.

<DIRECTION>
The President, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand years old. The shadow, the composition of the SHOT tells us all. It's down to what's in the heart of one man. Kenny is deeply moved at his friend's Gethsemane.

<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all the missiles?

</THE_PRESIDENT>

Sweeney glances at LeMay. LeMay's stern, frozen look wills him to say, very simply, "yes."

But then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the eye. It would make Machiavelli himself tell the truth.

Tracers and flack pepper the air in front of Ecker's Crusader. METAL PINGS, TINKS, RATTLES off the fuselage. Anti-aircraft and small arms fire comes up from all over, hitting the planes multiple times. He surveys the shapes in the target zone dead ahead.

EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast over the missile site. Over trailers. Over tents. Over trucks. Over trenches. Over bulldozers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then they're out over forest again. It's all over in seconds. The triple-A stops. In unison, the two planes bank right, heading for the distant blue, blue sea.

Kenny paces by the phone. It rings. He picks up, listens, reacts. Relief. And we know the planes have made it back.

EXT. RUNWAY - CECIL FIELD, FLA. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to his battered, pock-marked plane. Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW CHIEF come running up, the Chief letting out a whistle.

Wilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make of him. The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more impressed GROUND CREW come up.

<ECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are bird strikes. Sparrows to be precise. Got a problem with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ECKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time, and shakes his head, 'No.' Ecker takes the Chief's maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker: BIRD STRIKES. He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	World War One. Thirteen million killed all because the militaries of both alliances were so highly attuned to each other's movements and dispositions, afraid of letting the other guy have a theoretical advantage.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And here we are, fifty years later. One of their ships resists the inspection. We shoot out its rudder and board. They shoot down our planes in response. We bomb their anti-aircraft sites in response to that. They attack Berlin. We invade Cuba. They fire their missiles. We fire ours.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS

Kenny makes his way through the dim, deserted halls. Somewhere in the distance a phone rings. He reaches a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North Entrance. The cool air invigorates him. He eyes the fence, Pennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world from the living city beyond. He starts for the main gate.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

A WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches.

	No. No, I'll let her sleep. Let 'em sleep.

Kenny says it with a certain finality. The Police Officer nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering the weight of the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White House. A 24-hour drug store's doors are open. He pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the store employees - talk in undertones at the counter. Behind it, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem. Sober voices, sober looks. Kenny moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEWS STAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand. They're waiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's Washington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the sidewalk from the delivery truck. Kenny approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem so young, Kenny so old. Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire headlines, every story about the crisis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street. Up ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church. Lines of CHURCHGOERS are at the door. Kenny stops, surprised at the sight this late. And then he sees the hand-painted banner: CONFESSIONS 24 HOURS. PRAY FOR PEACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny is moved. He glances over his shoulder, and then... joins the line himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Kenny's WATCH reads one minute til ten o'clock. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House Situation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room. A long, central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and screens built in. T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in the corners. There are no windows, just oppressive bunker like walls. It's far underground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room the President paces, phone in hand. Half of EXCOM is in their seats. The other half, along with a steady stream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going. Kenny steps aside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President.

THE CAMERA TRACKS AROUND HIM, REVEALING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control. Big screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of communications equipment. A massive LIGHT TABLE on the floor at the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and Atlantic. Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH OFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the latest ship positions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McNamara's in a booth overlooking the room. It's open to the next tier below where Admiral Anderson is giving orders.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGE WING - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- between the destroyer, U.S.S. Pierce and the SOVIET FREIGHTERS Gagarin and Kimovsk. The Pierce's bridge wings are crammed with helmeted OFFICERS and LOOKOUTS. They peer through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead, straight for them. The CAPTAIN lowers his binoculars, determined.

</THE_PRESIDENT>
<MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>

All around the room frustration. Bobby shakes his head. Kenny sinks back in his chair. The President hesitates.

Admiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER. The man makes the connection on a switchboard.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room EXPLODES, victorious. Kenny and Bobby break into big grins, grab each other. Kenny pumps the President's hand. Rusk and Bundy slap each other on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked.

The ruckus goes on for a minute. McCone comes back in.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
His voice is lost in the celebration. McCone calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
The hubub dies away.

<MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, we have the tally from NSA. We have twenty ships stopping and or turning around. Six, however, appear to be continuing for the line. Including the Gagarin and Kimovsk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
The elation goes out of the room. Kenny looks at the President. The President picks up the phone again.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, have the ships you're observing changed course?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. President. They've just crossed the quarantine line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an accident. They must not have gotten their orders yet. Let 'em go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlikely, Mr. President. We've been monitoring transmissions from both the Gagarin and Kimovsk. Their radios are working fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One ship, an accident maybe. Six: this is intentional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
The President looks to Bobby. He has no answer. Kenny's mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense, suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're right. This is intentional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He glances around the room. All of EXCOM is looking at him. Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which are carrying contraband, and he's letting the ones which aren't go through, hoping for an incident. I think we should let them go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby relaxes. Around the table there are nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we do, it erodes the credibility of the quarantine. He'll just send more through tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
The President looks at Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we deal with it tomorrow. But today he's stopped most of them. He's done something smart here. We gave him an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of it, preserving just enough room to save face. We need to do something just as smart now.

Bobby's nodding, following the argument. Kenny looks around the room for support.

McNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, I agree. Let them go. Four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line. They've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard. It would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby likes getting under Kenny's skin. Bobby aims a punch at his head which Kenny knocks away. The President changes gear, serious.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
	</DIALOGUE>

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>

	We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.

<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's move the quarantine line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
It's a simple suggestion. The President considers him a beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads for them. The three friends assume their more reserved, political faces as he comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President. Bobby. Kenny. The Essex battle group has the Gagarin, Kimovsk and the sub escort under their thumb. We've got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could use a few more hours. I think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to 500 miles.
	</DIALOGUE>

Bobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of Svengali. Kenny just stands there, poker faced.

Kenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn. They stride down the hall, side by side.

	Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
(snappish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
They turn a corner, silence for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chiefs are looking for a provocation out there. The President's going to come under enormous pressure. You have to keep 'em on a short leash, Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
McNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>

	You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
	</DIALOGUE>

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --

	-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides me.

That gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the tension.

-- and sees the President leaning over his desk, jabbing his finger at General Taylor.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>

<DIRECTION>
(noticing Kenny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Kenny, did you hear me give the order to go to DEFCON 2? I remember giving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but I must be suffering from amnesia because I've just been informed our nuclear forces are DEFCON 2!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>

Kenny realizes he's not joking as he spots Bobby sitting on the couch behind Taylor, pale as a ghost. Taylor, embattled, wants to die, but stands there like a man.

The President punches his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
	</DIALOGUE>

<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General, the Joint Chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signalled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
But Taylor knows this very well. And the way he's suffering, it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings. From over on the couch Bobby chimes in:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LeMay... he's history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>

The President glances at Kenny who stands there, speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here, Max.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The General leaves. Kenny closes the door, wanders deeper into the office. He looks from the President to Bobby. There's a long, long beat of shocked silence.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.

</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't do that, Bobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McNamara won't be able to handle them. It's too much for one man...

(knowing look to Kenny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...with all due respect to our heroic fifth column.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The President collapses in his rocking chair. Kenny leans over the back of the sofa next to Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got Khruschev's attention with the blockade. If we want a political solution. I think it's time to turn up the diplomatic heat. Cause if we let this go on too long, we're going to find ourselves in a war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks at the President, meaningful. The President turns to Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>

The West Wing looms behind Kenny and Bundy. Kenny, poker faced, takes a drag on his cigarette. Bundy nervously flicks his, looks away from Kenny a beat.

<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<KENNY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bundy turns back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>

	Thank God. Look, everyone is furious about it. We trade away our missiles in Turkey and we're fucked politically.

Kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything. He agrees. Bundy steps up to him, confiding.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea - they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.

Kenny gets in his face, intimidating.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' And you think I'll play your Judas. You WASPS and blue-bloods never understood us, thinking we want into your club. Well we got our own club now.

Kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting area, newspaper in hand. The President, buttoning his shirt in a full-length mirror, sees him. There's a TV on. The President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper.

<THE_PRESIDENT>

</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai lowers the phone to its cradle. An ANXIOUS STAFFER sticks his head in the door, a concerned, questioning look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai adjusts his tie. HIS HAND IS SHAKING. He notices it, and manages a brave smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL, U.N. - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai, briefcase in hand, marches down the hall at the hand of his team: Staffers and Photo Interpreters with large leather portfolio bags. The big double doors to the council chamber loom, and he gestures to the Photo Interpreters.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
And then a DOORMAN throws open the door for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai enters. He is instantly dwarfed by the enormous room. Lights, T.V. cameras, the imposing circular arrangement of delegation tables. And the entire world is watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai pauses. Then as the first SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS begin to notice him, he heads for the vacant seats for the American delegation. The ROMANIAN DELEGATE saws the air.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANIAN_DELEGATE>
<DIRECTION>
(through translator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we call upon the world to condemn this purely American provocation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANIAN_DELEGATE>
<DIRECTION>
But as the Romanian wheezes on, all eyes are on Adlai. Adlai takes his seat, his Staffers behind him. They pass him up papers, and he spreads them before him, taking no notice that the entire room is staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai finally glances up. Across the circle sits Zorin, in the flesh, at the head of his own tough-looking DELEGATION. He acknowledges Adlai with a superior smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANIAN_DELEGATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We, the people of Romania, stand in solidarity with the people of Cuba and their revolution in the face of this American threat to world peace. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANIAN_DELEGATE>
<DIRECTION>
The Romanian Delegate leans back from his microphone. Zorin leans forward, begins in Russian, and the Translator's voice catches up with him. His tone, body language, composure are all that of complete confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
(through translator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are glad you could join us, Mr. Stevenson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai nods, returns to his notes, as Zorin continues.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last couple of hours I have heard nothing but questions from the world here. The United States has led us to the brink of calamity. The peoples of the world want to know why. We are told again and again of this so called incontrovertible evidence of offensive weapons in Cuba. Yet we are not allowed to see this evidence. Are your spy planes so secret you cannot share this evidence with us? Some planes?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
The audience laughs. Zorin basks in it. And then grows stern.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or perhaps there is no such evidence. Perhaps the United States is mistaken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXCOM watches the coverage on the situation room's T.V.'s. The President and Bobby sit side by side, Kenny just behind them. Bobby checks his watch, looks at the President.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I make the call, and Adlai is out. McCloy goes in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks back at Kenny.

<DIRECTION>
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zorin stares at Adlai. Adlai studiously ignores him, works on his own papers.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The United States has no facts in hand. Falsity is what America has in its hands - false evidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
Zorin leans back in his chair. Adlai finally looks up. He meets Zorin's icy bravura. He notes the cameras around the room. This is the grandest stage of all.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The chair recognizes the representative from the United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
And in that moment, Adlai becomes the spokesman for America.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let me say something to you, Mr. Ambassador, we do have the evidence. We have it, and it is clear and incontrovertible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai's tone is definitive. A tremor of interest passes through the various delegations.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And let me say something else. Those weapons must be taken out of Cuba. You, the Soviet Union, have created this new danger, not the United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXCOM is transfixed by the continuing debate.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Adlai!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
They all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight. Except for Bobby. Kenny glances over at him. He has the phone pinned between his ear and shoulder. Kenny looks back to the T.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai fixes Zorin in his seat, his voice rising.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Zorin, I remind you that the other day you did not deny the existence of these weapons. But today, again, if I heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
Zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but doesn't respond, acts bored. It gets Adlai's goat, and he begins to lose his cool. A rumble from the U.N. The CAMERA FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXCOM is worried.

<DIRECTION>
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Adlai's tremors are not tremors of fear. They are tremors of anger. His voice goes hard and cold.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, sir. Let me ask you one simple question. Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in Cuba? Yes or no - don't wait for the translation - yes or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
The diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of civility, all statesman-like grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXCOM's excitement mounts. In the chorus urging Adlai on, we find Kenny edge toward the screen.

	Yeah. Yeah.

<DIRECTION>
Zorin shoots Adlai a testy look.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor puts questions. In due course, sir, you will have your answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
There's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a tete. The RUMBLE in the room grows louder.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in the courtroom of world opinion right now, and you can answer yes or no. You have denied they exist, and I want to know if I have understood you correctly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
EXCOM ROARS! Fists in the air! Bobby lets the phone dangle a beat, covers it. And then he lifts it again.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, I'll get back to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers the phone to the receiver. Kenny shoots him a triumphant smile. The President looks at Kenny, shakes his head, a big smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai presses on.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm prepared to present the evidence in this room, proving that the Soviet Union has lied to the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>
<DIRECTION>
And Zorin cracks. He looks uneasily to his delegation. They bend forward to consult. Adlai sits back in his chair, draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of someone who knows he's kicked ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his answer, managing not to smile. The diplomatic world is scandalized. At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his huddle.
</DIRECTION>
<ZORIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you do not choose to continue your statement, the Chair recognizes the representative from Chile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZORIN>
<DIRECTION>
The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands.

<CHILEAN_DELEGATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I yield my time and the floor to the representative to the United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILEAN_DELEGATE>
<DIRECTION>
The room explodes in laughter. Not just nervous any more, not just polite. They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary ploy blowing up in his face. Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed. And he looks like the biggest fool in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain. At last, Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing boards.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, ladies and gentlemen, since it appears we might be here for a while, shall we have a look at what the Soviets are doing in Cuba?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADLAI>

The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to approach Adlai.

EXCOM celebrates. Phones ring at several of the chairs at the conference table. The President and Kenny meet as Bundy picks up a phone in the b.g.

<DIRECTION>
McNamara leans against the wall, closes his eyes in exhaustion and stress. And when he opens the, we PAN AROUND TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A G-d-like view of the flag plot, covered with HUNDREDS OF SHIPS, PLANES AND MARKINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McNamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols, living men behind each one. Each tangle of red and blue symbols a powderkeg. A G-dlike view indeed. And it is far more than any one mere man could keep control of. And he begins to realize it.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're kidding ourselves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
And not only that, in his bleary, sleep-deprived fog, he begins to understand something happening down there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map, over the scrolling cryptic numerology. THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds in from the background. The overhead platform swivels on its motor, like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the Watch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McNamara stares, at the verge of grasping something. Through the door-crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander thing, some grander design.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ANDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well. Load your guns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_ANDERSON>
<DIRECTION>
That starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie. He goes to the railing, looks down on Anderson.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that, Admiral?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson turns, gazes up from his tier below, distracted.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ANDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.

	What are you doing?

</ADMIRAL_ANDERSON>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admiral, I asked you a question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson holds the phone aside, turns around again, looks up at him, impatient. His answer is hard, cold, dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMIRAL_ANDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to follow the Rules of Engagement. The Rules of Engagement which the President has approved and signed in his order of October 23rd.

The Destroyer's forward 5-inch twin guns swivel, train on the Groznyy. A beat. They OPEN FIRE with an ear-splitting BAMBAM, ripping the air in front of the muzzles, the Groznyy so close a miss isn't possible.

The Destroyer's guns hammer away at the Groznyy, at point blank range... but the Groznyy IS UNHARMED.

Suddenly, in the air above it appear BRILLIANT FLARES. They light up the ship, brighter than the sun. The destroyer isn't firing deadly rounds... it's firing harmless starshells.

Everyone's eyes are on the two men. Only the chatter of teletype breaks the paralyzing silence. McNamara blinks, looks down at the plot on the floor. Anderson's voice drops to a deadly sotto.

McNamara turns back. And all trepidation, embarrassment, hesitation are gone. He coldly appraises Anderson.

	With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.

OFF THEIR REACTIONS, the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength, ad hoc EXCOM - Kenny, Bobby, Taylor, Bundy, Sorensen, McCone, Ball and the President. Guarded hope all around. The short, balding, pugnacious Scali looks discomfited.
</DIRECTION>
<SCALI>

	I have lunch with him maybe once a month. Way he talks, he acts like he knows Khruschev personally, but he's never elaborated. I've used him as a source in a couple of stories.

</MCCONE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.

	That may be what they want us to think.

INT. FBI, COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FILES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! A STACK OF FILES slams down beside Kenny on a large paper-covered conference table. WALTER SHERIDAN, Kenny's investigator-buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like Kenny. Kenny and Walter RIFLE through the folders, super fast, super proficient. A half-dozen FBI AGENTS work around the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. So, what we've got is this guy Alexander Feklisov, aka Alexander Fomin, declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy, but in reality the KGB Papa Spy. An illustrious tour of duty during the Great Patriotic War gets him on the Party fast track, various tours of duty in KGB, American postings. He's an expert on us, and... that's all we've got on Papa Spy.

Walter pushes a typed dateline of Khruschev's major career moves, and one of the Agents hands Kenny a list of Fomin's postings. He lays them side by side. And for every step of Khruschev's, there's a step for Fomin. Not only that, but the DATES ARE IDENTICAL or nearly so.

INT. STATLER HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few lonely BUSINESS TRAVELERS hang out in the dim coffee shop. Faint music plays. Scali and ALEXANDER FOMIN sit with steaming cups of coffee. Scali, nervous, unfolds a note. Fomin, an expressionless gray spectre of a man, eyes him. He is, in his boredom, a spy's spy.
</DIRECTION>
<SCALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALI>
<FOMIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOMIN>
<SCALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALI>
<FOMIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is from the Highest Authority?

</FOMIN>
<SCALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.

<FOMIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - STATE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a cluster of folding metal chairs, Kenny, Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen watch a TELETYPE hammer out the message as it comes off the wire. It's painfully slow, like watching a bad typist type a manuscript. Ten pages of this is an eternity. To top it off, it's in Russian. A TRANSLATOR reads it off, word by word to a TRANSCRIBER.

Kenny slams a page of Khruschev's letter on the table. He jabs his finger at it. EXCOM listens, intent.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but he's saying right here. He'll remove the missiles in return for a no-invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin's overture was genuine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The President turns to McCone.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our early analysis says this was probably written by Khruschev himself. It's a first draft, and shows no signs of being polished by the foreign ministry. In fact, it probably hasn't been approved by the Politburo. They wouldn't have let the emotionalism go by. The analysts say it was written by someone under considerable stress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>

EXCOM chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad to hear we're not alone.

</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
There are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. Except from McCone and Taylor. The President takes his copy of the letter, flips through it. He shakes his head, almost unable to believe that Khruschev has given in. A long beat.

EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway. The door opens, and Kenny steps out. He says an inaudible goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off. He turns, facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard, the lights out. And he smiles. Home at last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. O'DONNELL PATIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A screen door squeaks open. Kenny steps out into the darkness of the back yard. And there, in her robe, sitting startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the kitchen window, is Helen. Kenny stands there tired, his coat slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his. For a silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines of each others' face for the changes of a long separation. They see them. But they've been married a long time, and the awkwardness passes.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

Kenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty Officers race past him, almost bowling him over. He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval Office, DISCOVERING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOTAL CHAOS. EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the offices and halls. On all their faces grim expressions. Kenny stands there a beat in confusion. And then Bobby swings out of Kenny's office. There's a desperate edge to Bobby's voice.

INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny as he and Bobby enter. Kenny can only bear his look for a second: he blew the call on Fomin. But the President is clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile. Half of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor barely notice them as they're already there arguing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins the conversation in mid-stream.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup. A puppet Khruschev, and a hard-line Soviet government pulling the strings. No deal. And the missiles are almost operational.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Bitter silence. They all look to the President. Imminent victory has turned to ashes. The President studies his own folded hands. Ball and Thompson enter, take seats. One by one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the group.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem reasonable to everyone. We remove our missiles, they remove theirs. Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway. They're obsolete, after all.

</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny shakes his head in mute anger. McNamara and Rusk seem to sense the President's feelings, too.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom. They'll put a gun to our head again, and expect us to pay again.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night, we looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess. Today, the Soviets are reneging. We're going to try to salvage the situation, but a lot of things are going wrong today. It's making everyone nervous, and it will be very hard to avoid going to war. Don't get shot down, Major. Beyond that, whatever else you can do to help us, I'd really appreciate it.

INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Major Anderson waves his NCOs away. They leave the room. The Major sits on a bench in front of his locker, thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_ANDERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're up there at 72,000 feet, there's a million things that can go wrong. Is your oxygen mix right? Will your cameras freeze up? Are you leaving contrail...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those million things are beyond your control, mostly... But you know, when you realize that, there's a kind of peace. You don't need to be in control. You never were in control in the first place. If you're a good man, and your ground crew are good men, it's all you can ask for. And with the grace of G-d, it'll get you through.

With a click, the line goes dead and Anderson walks the phone over to the receiver on the wall.

END INTERCUT

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNWAY - MACDILL AFB - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel. Beside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up. He adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight. Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson switches over to the U-2's oxygen supply as his NCOs belt him in. They slap him on the helmet for good luck and lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_ANDERSON>

SMASH CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere. Far below -- clouds, shining blue day. Above, stars and the indigo depths of space. We hang in utter silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silver glint appears in the center of the horizon. It grows larger. Then larger still. It is the U-2. We barely have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson's gloved hand reaches for the CAMERA HEATER switches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The belly door whines open like a silver eyelid, exposing the camera's lense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson double checks his position, switches to the autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide, then hits the CAMERA ACTIVATE button on his joystick. BAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter spool down. He stares out the window. The towering clouds below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rapt, Anderson stares. And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT. It shocks Anderson around to the controls. It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the cameras, disabling autopilot. He banks the U-2 hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds, barely visible, rises a CONTRAIL. It arcs lazily toward us. A beat, and then another CONTRAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then ANOTHER. The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are too small to be seen with the naked eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon outside tilted. Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he does his strains going into the high-g turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now. He waits. Waits. Waits, still in the turn. The black head of the missile now visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for dogfighting. They BEND terribly in the rollout. And then the first missile STREAKS past, tries to correct its miss, but can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second missile rises up, now visible. He puts the throttle as far as it goes, trying to outrun death. Every second is a tenth of a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane, levels off, and closes on it at a tremendous rate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third missile rises up in the far distance behind the second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind it, can't miss. Then at a hundred yards, the contrail suddenly peters out, and the missile, out of fuel, drops away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the third missile closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anderson glances out the window, sees the spent missiles fall away, and spots the third missile still seeking him aft. Hand pinning the throttle forward, he prays under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third SA-2 rides its billowing column of exhaust straight for the tail of the U-2. This one is not out of fuel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Major Anderson opens his eyes. He stares out the window at the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the missile looms. We have time to realize it's almost as big as the plane itself before it SHEARS right into the U 2's tail and EXPLODES in a BLINDING FLASH.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE BUNDY'S OFFICE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Kenny, jogging down the hall, hears form an open door.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenny!

</BUNDY>

Kenny goes over to the threshold. Inside the office Bundy stands up from behind his desk, grave. And Kenny knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of EXCOM is there except for Bundy. Kenny sits behind the President, deeply distraught over Major Anderson.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, taken with the events of the past few hours, I believe this confirms our worst fears. We're now dealing with a hard-line Soviet government, perhaps with Khruschev as a puppet head, perhaps not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
In the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room. They're convinced by McCone's pronouncement. Kenny's not.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could be a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
McCone gives him a get-serious look. But Kenny presses on.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to be positive before we react.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bundy enters the room. Everyone looks up. He stands there in the doorway, his face tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny sags in his chair. Bundy, of course, has more bad news, and they all know it. A hopeless beat. The President just stares at Bundy, unable to ask. Bundy nods, affirming what everyone is thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission over Siberia got lost and penetrated Soviet airspace. The Soviets scrambled MIGs in pursuit, thinking it was a bomber. It got out okay. Somebody forgot to cancel the mission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammitt. There's always some sonofabitch who doesn't get the word. All we need is the Soviets thinking we're bombing them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(facetious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The humor falls on a cold audience.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, our pilots are in danger. We must order punitive airstrikes against the SAM site that shot down Major Anderson per our rules of engagement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
And finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has come to pass. He looks at Bobby, then at the President. The President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if trying to read the Fates' design in it. A long beat, and everyone holds their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I want confirmation there wasn't some sort of accident first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
LeMay clears his throat. Everyone looks at him, expecting him to scream or jump up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's a good idea, Mr. President. It'll be safer for my boys to get those SAMs on Monday when we get the rest of the bastards. I can wait a day and a half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMAY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, then.

But he says it without any belief in the words, realizing they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone in his office, shattered, Kenny stares out the window, viewing the distant Ellipse through a gap in the trees. Kids are out there playing football. He glances at his watch, and grabs his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the bright autumn day, walking away from the White House. It drops behind him -- his step is faster, more urgent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the Ellipse. The sixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running play. Kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELLIPSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the edge of the open field. And then he spots the name on the jersey: O'Donnell. It's Kevin. The players relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field. Kevin sees his dad.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over. Kevin pulls his helmet off. They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, sport. You winning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
But Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything going to be okay, Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny's forced smile is answer enough.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Kev. Everything's gonna be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
But Kevin knows. Together they know. The end of the world is at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a car HONKS. Kenny turns around. Bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo. And he sees what Kenny is doing. He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenny! We need to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks back at his son.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you? Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin puts his helmet back on his head. Kenny watches as Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team. Kenny turns his back on his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the restaurant's parking lot. Bobby's Secret Service Agents maintain a discreet distance.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we're going to make a deal, we're going to have to do it fast. This is only getting out of control. The only reason we're not at war this very minute is he's been able to stretch, bend and break his own rules. He won't be able to keep it up forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth. A beat. Kenny looks him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby is speechless with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole, you're so wrong. It's a deuce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's beyond furious. They catch their rising voices.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's not just me who thinks that. Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is telling you exactly the same thing: make the trade, and they're going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won't trade like Berlin, and we do end up in a war.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to mention, that long before that happens, this government will be politically dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking. And boy, does this guy hate admitting he's wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny stares off at the city, agonized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen talking with the President. The President gives him a brief, meaningful look.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever response we send, it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the Kremlin. So we're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before Khruschev could respond.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<DIRECTION>
As Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby. Bobby whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gets it, but he's pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<SORENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends on if we really believe there's been a coup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORENSEN>
<DIRECTION>
That strikes a cord with Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree. If there has been a coup, and there's a hard-line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. The end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war. But what if there hasn't been a coup? What if... what if what is happening is a series of accidents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<SORENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second letter is an accident?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORENSEN>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then these accidents have happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<SORENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Guns of August.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORENSEN>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<SORENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we reject the second letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORENSEN>
<DIRECTION>
And Kenny looks at Bobby. The world stops.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We don't reject it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... We accept the first letter and pretend the second doesn't exist.

The President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

HOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire assembled EXCOM. Finally McCone breaks the spell.

<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't work --

<DIRECTION>
Bobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises his voice over theirs.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

McNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.

Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara, grateful.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

</MCNAMARA>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we have to make them agree to it. So how do we do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<DIRECTION>
The President leans forward. Sensing he's about to speak, all eyes turn to him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Most EXCOM is nodding, agreeing. McCone shakes his head in disgust. Taylor sits in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever carries the message has to hit the nail on the head. Come across as too soft, they'll push us. Too hard, they'll be cornered and even more dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSK>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They could pre-empt.
	</DIALOGUE>

It's a terrible responsibility to bear. The room is silent. At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. The President stares back. There is nobody else who can do this. Only Bobby. His brother.

A LONG SHOT: Bobby emerges from the West Wing in his overcoat, briefcase in hand. He pauses, tiny, alone. The West Wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him - reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour mission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, out of the shadows, in the f.g., steps Kenny in his own coat, his breath frosting in the late-night air. Bobby sees him, and knows he is not so alone anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DRIVEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They meet in front of the limo. Bobby stops, shuffles his things, awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want? A good-bye kiss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny opens the driver's side door. The Secret Service LIMO DRIVER peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<LIMO_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Kenny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIMO_DRIVER>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Joe. Listen, I'll take care of him. Go ahead in, grab some coffee. We'll be back pretty quick.

</KENNY>
<LIMO_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIMO_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny's nod and look -- there's no arguing. The Limo Driver hops out, and Kenny gets in. Bobby stands there outside for a beat. He tries to hide how touched he is, but can't completely.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you? Forget how to open a car door?

INT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby recovers, opens his own door, gets in the front seat next to Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you rich people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny starts up the engine. Bobby smiles a twisted smile. As the car pulls away, the two men sit in silence, neither willing to admit how glad the other is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The limo wheels out into the street, carrying the two friends into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights the lives behind those windows. As the car drives on and on, the tension returns. Bobby feels the weight of all those lives. On him. A long beat. He gazes at Kenny, the only man he could ever admit this to:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I can do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny glances over at him. Bobby stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nobody else I'd rather have going in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody else I'd trust Helen and the kids' lives to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny means it. He looks away. Bobby shifts, awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks him. This isn't the way to the Justice Department. But he complies.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
And Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know... I hate being called the brilliant one. The ruthless one. They guy who does the dirty work. The one everybody's afraid of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate it. I'm not smart, you know. And I'm not so ruthless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right about the smart part, but ruthless, well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
That breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Appears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY. Police cars line the streets outside it. All the windows are dark. A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated entrance. On the opposite side of the street lounge two dozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny gives Bobby a look. Bobby rolls down his window.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down. Smell that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOVIET EMBASSY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the Embassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up to the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of the Embassy's several chimneys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA races into it. It engulfs us all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice Department. The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump out, head up the steps to the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL OUTSIDE BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall, Staffer #1 taking Bobby's coat.
</DIRECTION>
<STAFFER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already here. We have him waiting in your office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAFFER_1>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop. Bobby faces Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll whistle up some luck for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
And before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes. In its place, a severe confidence. A grandeur Kenny has never seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It makes Kenny pause. He beholds his best friend become a man of the ages. And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history. HOLD ON Bobby's waiting room. Silent. Cavernous. Dim. Plush carpet. Heavy drapes framing dark windows. And abandoned secretary's desk. A row of sofas and chairs on either side of the room. Two doorways, one at either end of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors. Dressed in gray. Prim. But beautiful. A secretary of some sort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. Kenny glides in. He sees the other door shut at the far end of the room. Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny WHISTLES two notes. Stops. And then he begins to WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo. He gets a bar into it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny stops. Then notices the Woman in gray across the room. He didn't see her. It's dim over there. She looks at him, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel. A RED HAMMER AND SICKLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny reacts. Dobrynin's assistant? His opposite number? A friend? Or more than a friend?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here is the face of the enemy. Not a smile between them. Kenny resumes his ease. And begins to WHISTLE again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling, filling the dim room. Strange, sad, beautiful. The woman listens. And her face begins to soften.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving to fill the empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming... and the Woman's voice breaks in. Kenny stops, looks over. Her voice is tremulous and beautiful. Just a snatch of some song in Russian. She stops, awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny stares. The Woman stares back. No smiles. But in their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's beauty, the other's humanity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So this is the enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny glances to the door. He considers for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny breaks the gaze. He begins to whistle again. The CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office, Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... to the other side of that DOOR. Dobrynin sits in a chair opposite Bobby behind his desk. The room is equally dim. And far more tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of O'Donnell Aboo. Dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Bobby, unseen by Dobrynin, can't help the flicker of a private smile. It's Kenny's presence, and Bobby is the stronger for it. And then the tune is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby leans forward, cool, controlled, masterful.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ambassador Dobrynin, we are aware that at this moment your missiles in Cuba are at the brink of operational readiness...

EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS

Floodlights illuminate MISSILES, vertical on their erectors, support VEHICLES, clustered across the man-made clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the nearest missile. Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others. They've already been fueled.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>

Dobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.

	My brother, my friends, my countrymen and I cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise you that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin looks out the window. And then, pained, looks back at Bobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBRYNIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I fear our two nations will go to war. And I fear where war will lead us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBRYNIN>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby acknowledges him with a nod.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the missiles do not become operational, if you remove the missiles, then there will be no war.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At this moment, the President is accepting the terms of Secretary Khruschev's letter of Friday night. If the Soviet Union halts construction immediately, removes the missiles, and submits to U.N. inspection, the United States will pledge to never invade Cuba or aid others in that enterprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin stares at Bobby. Stares hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBRYNIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were removed also, such an accommodation could be reached.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBRYNIN>
<DIRECTION>
The two men move their argument forward with the deliberation and formality of chess masters.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(tired sounding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The United States cannot agree to such terms under threat. Any belief to the contrary --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- was in error.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin reels internally. The only sign on his face is a slight tremor. Bobby looks up, registers the calculated effect. And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes:
</DIRECTION>
<DOBRYNIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want war...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBRYNIN>
<DIRECTION>
But not so fast. Bobby folds his hands. And he smoothly goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the United States can offer a private assurance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin holds his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are obsolete, and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time. This withdrawal should be completed within, say, six months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin lets out his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the ramifications. Still he hesitates a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBRYNIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBRYNIN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DOBRYNIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBRYNIN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line. Dobrynin struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to hug him. It comes across as agitation.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.

Dobrynin rises from his chair. Bobby rises with him.

<DOBRYNIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBRYNIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dobrynin heads for the door. Half way there he turns back to Bobby, deeply moved. Deeply grateful.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBRYNIN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war.

<DIRECTION>
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny enters the Oval Office through his side door. The office is dark, only the desk lamp on. Kenny's gaze moves over the trappings of power: the carpet with the Presidential Seal, the rocking chair by the fireplace, the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And on the desk, tucked almost out of sight, sits a small, humble wooden plaque. It's turned to face the occupant of the chair behind the desk. Kenny reaches out, turns it around. It is the Breton's Fisherman's Prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads: OH LORD, THY SEA IS GREAT, MY BOAT SO SMALL.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORTICO - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- onto the portico. Standing there in the dark, by the white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are Bobby and the President. They're holding drinks. Kenny joins them.

The President gestures out across the South Lawn to the gleaming Washington Monument.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks at the President. The President feels it, and gazes back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them stare out at the glittering city. The grandness of the world lies before them, and they are deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. The silence is beyond power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it. There is nothing left to say. The President, at last, finishes his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, we never did control it. Not really. Not like we think.

EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the bottom of his driveway. He watches it go, silently urging it to return for him with some call from the President telling him he's desperately needed. But it doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to his house. The lights are all out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase. His knuckles are white. With conscious effort, he unfolds his hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of Armageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny rounds a corner. McNamara, Bundy and McCone are talking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the hall. Kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they notice he's approaching. Bundy nods him over, confidential.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been talking. We can play this big in '64. It's the foreign policy trophy we've been waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny sickens. He tries to listen, but it all begins to blur.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we can ride it all the way home next election. Bet you're way ahead of us, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
Bundy slaps Kenny on the back. Kenny is pale. Is what they're saying possible? But Bundy and McCone are too wrapped up in their schemes to notice Kenny's distress.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've ordered crash reassessment of our major geopolitical hotspots. We've got a lot of new clout, and we can run the table on the Soviets. Middle East, Southeast Asia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
And Kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes it is possible. They haven't gotten it. He is speechless, helplessly shaking his head. Bundy finally sees something isn't right with him.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, O'Donnell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny can't speak. Can't find the words. But tongue-tied finally manages:
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
McNamara and Bundy look at him funny.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understand what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow. They begin to feel uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sun came up today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It shouldn't have. But it did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<MCCONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were lucky we were able to keep it under control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCONE>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks away, unable to bear it.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Says what, Kenny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny looks back at them.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something... amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
They just stare at him. And with secret smiles, superior smiles, they nod.
</DIRECTION>
<MCNAMARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Ken. I understand. Feels good to win, doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCNAMARA>
<DIRECTION>
But they don't understand, and together turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<BUNDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later, Kenny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUNDY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into the labyrinth of the West Wing. Kenny turns his back on them.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The President stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux for some Sunday special event. Kenny gathers up his folder from nearby breakfast table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny meets the President's gaze in the mirror, and the two men know they have been to the same mountaintop.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for some necessary thing. Ready to go back into the game.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...never mind. See you around, Kenny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny starts to leave, but at the door, turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The President looks at him in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this was what we're here for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The President smiles an ever-so-faint smile. Kenny turns and leaves the room, vanishing, and as we HOLD on the empty doorway, the simple, whistled melody of O'DONNELL ABOO drifts from the hallway beyond, becoming our END MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shortly after the crisis President Kennedy ordered a reassessment of U.S.-Soviet relations, ushering a brief thaw in the Cold War. During this time, the Washington-Moscow hotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis, miscommunication would not lead to nuclear war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after the crisis ended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUPER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby Kennedy ran for president in 1968. After winning the California primary, he called Kenny from the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles and told him, "I finally feel like I'm out from under my brother's shadow."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby was assassinated minutes later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN SUPER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The members of EXCOM continued to serve with distinction in government in various capacities over the next three decades. As Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara urged containment of the Soviet threat in every theatre of conflict around the world. He ultimately advised President Johnson to increase the U.S. military commitment to one of these minor backwater conflicts: Vietnam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND FINALLY SUPER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny O'Donnell witnessed the President's assassination from the car behind. He went on to head the Peace Platform at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, fighting to end the Vietnam War. He died in 1977.
</DIRECTION>
