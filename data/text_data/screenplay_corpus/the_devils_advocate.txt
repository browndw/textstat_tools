INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an efficient man with a good case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been carefully rehearsed.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... we go back to our homeroom for dismissal, unless you have a pass for sports or something.

<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class.

	What happened next, Barbara?

</PROSECUTOR>

<PROSECUTOR>

</PROSECUTOR>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In your own words, Barbara, can you tell us exactly what happened during the next few minutes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<DIRECTION>
KEVIN LOMAX. Defense counsel. Taking it all in.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him I was afraid I would miss my bus. He promised I would get to the bus on time if I would help him to do something...

<DIRECTION>
Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom -- taking inventory -- assessing damage --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Then he put -- before I could say anything -- he placed his hand inside my blouse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin -- checking the jury and --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I was so frightened I didn't move. I thought if I was just quiet it would be okay...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops him cold --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Then his other hand went up under -- inside my skirt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... his hand then, it started, he started, moving back and forth -- farther and farther inside my skirt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... he said he was testing to see if I had any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings I had...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg -- absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I didn't know what to say, I was trying to think of something to say but I was confused and he just kept on -- with his hand -- moving it -- under my dress -- higher and higher...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin is rocked. Trying not to show it.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... then I, I was asking him to stop but it was like he couldn't hear me -- he just kept on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and then I screamed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him. Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... then he, he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did he try again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>

	That's a veal roast, Your Honor. U.S.D.A. approved and stamped. Eight days ago, in Kansas City, two men pushed a calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high- voltage staple-gun into the animal's skull. Men kill animals and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez killed a goat. He killed a goat. And he did it at home, in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs. Now some people may find it bizarre. It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone. It's not as common as, say, circumcision. It's certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into blood. It's not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to prove one's faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't two thousand miles away in a stockyard. He doesn't use electricity to kill.

(buzzing here)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, what I like, you got in there with him. Inside the cage. That's instinct. Can't be taught. You gotta hear that on your own. It's gotta be in your blood. It's molecular. I bet I've got five thousand lawyers working around the planet. I couldn't name ten -- couldn't name three -- I'd trust with Moyez.

</KEVIN>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they doing? They're corporate lawyers, what do you think they're doing? They're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon. They're doing needlepoint. Push button battles. Push button wars. Armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won. No pain. No sound. No smell. One big, multinational circle jerk. You, on the other hand, you're on the slaughterhouse floor. You can't help but smell your clients.

	I figure you came to court to make sure I didn't fuck this up.

	Maybe I did. But don't get too cocky. No matter how good you are. Don't let them see you coming. That's the gaff, my friend -- make yourself small. Be the hick. The cripple. The nerd. The leper. The shit- kicking surfer. Look at me -- I've been underestimated from day one. Do I look like a master of the universe? That's your only weakness as far as I can tell.

	You know what you're missing? What I have? This beautiful girl she's just fucked me every way she knows how -- we're done -- she's walking to the bathroom -- she turns back -- and there I am. It's me. And she smiles -- it's like a veil coming down across her face -- and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen? And see, right there, from that moment on, she's got a secret. I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the whisper in Nefertitti's ear. I'm a surprise. They never see me coming. That's what you're missing.

	Because I knew it was gonna be good. Because I knew I was gonna like it. That you would shine -- that we would take this walk -- that we'd really talk. Why I came down? You want the truth? I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat. I came up from nothing. From dirt. I'm warming my hands on your talent --

	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_POE>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence'. What he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now, Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don't like. He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. He's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children. He's cheated the city. His partners. His employees. He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. I don't like those things. I don't expect you to like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody. The state is going all out here. They've got a whole team over there. They're throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case. I need one thing from you. That's it. One thing. I need you to ask yourself, 'Is not liking this man reason enough to convict him of murder?'

But someplace completely different. Older. Dark. Empty. Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS approaching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead. There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects. More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is his frighteningly grim determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out. Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the suitcase.

<MRS_LOMAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He talked to me. Nobody'd ever really talked to me before. Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home, somebody takes an interest... Working so hard, putting himself through school, I'd never met anybody like that. Knew the Bible, every word, just knew it by heart. Every meal, there he was, at my ear and I just... I didn't want that week to ever end. But it did. He came to say goodbye, it was late, and I started to cry and he said not to worry, 'Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.' And that just stopped me cold because we'd spent that whole day at Bible study reading Matthew Ten and there was just no way for him to know about that, so I was... I took it as a sign. I let him in. And then everything was different. He was cruel. He was so cruel and I was so ashamed, I thought I'd die...

Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase. Mary Ann...

<MRS_LOMAX>

	I promised right there if God would let me back into His grace I would never leave again. I prayed there was a reason this terrible thing had happened. There had to be a reason. And there was. It was you. You were my blessing. You were reason enough to endure anything. How much I love you.

	Come on. You're not listening. Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope you're kidding. You could've saved her any time you liked. She only wanted love. But you knew it wouldn't really work out, didn't you? Mary Ann in New York? Face it, you started looking to better- deal her the minute you got here.

	Don't be such a fucking chump. There's only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self- delusion. I told you to take care of your wife -- that the world would understand. And you made a choice. 'You know what scares me, John? I leave the case, she gets better and I hate her for it...' Remember?

	Who told you to pull out the stops for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez -- the direction you took -- Snake handlers, Popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough -- whose ideas were those? And then Cullen -- knowing he's guilty -- seeing those pictures -- putting that lying bitch on the stand... What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was time to lose, right? You didn't think so.

	Vanity is definitely my favorite sin. Self love. It's so basic. What a drug. Cheap, all-natural, and right at your fingertips. Pride. That's where you're strongest. And believe me, I understand. Work for someone else? -- Hey, I couldn't hack it. 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.'

	No. That's the other guy. I don't judge anybody. As far as I'm concerned, everyone's a winner. God's your prankster, my boy. Think of it. He gives man instincts. He gives you this extraordinary gift and then, I swear to you -- for his own amusement -- his own private, cosmic gag reel -- he sets the rules in opposition. It's the goof of all time. Look but don't touch. Touch but don't taste. Taste but don't swallow. And while you're jumping from one foot to the other he's laughing his sick fucking ass off! He's a tight-ass. He's a sadist. He's an absentee landlord!

INT. MILTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're coming out, guns blazing. The two of you -- all of us -- acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it reaches so high into heaven it chokes the whole fucking lot of them! What we cannot legislate we will buy. What we cannot buy we will degrade. We will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a vandalized, neon sign! And while God is busy at his peephole -- as he deigns us with his disapproval -- as he lumbers around his empty kingdom like some overfed colonial governor -- as God sleeps late, we will win. We've got a winner here, kids!

Kevin moving quickly down the aisle.
