Edmunds is sitting at the bank of computers which are all blank. She looks relieved. Suddenly numbers start scrolling up on the monitor directly in front of her. She hits the keyboard to clear the screen, but the numbers keep coming...on another computer screen, then another and another, until all the screens are scrolling numbers. She frantically hits keys, but the numbers remain.

</NORMAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know. The attack on the habitat?

<DIRECTION>
(off Harry's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know there was an attack on this place?

</NORMAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must've slept through it.

</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You slept through it.

<HARRY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I was dead tired.

</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a good thing you don't have a living will, Harry. We would've had to have given all your organs away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the smoke didn't bother you? All the leaking...you know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(with book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever read this? Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea? I found it in the john -- probably somebody's misguided attempt at levity. I always loved this book. I could never get past page eighty- seven, though. Too scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to be, uh, strangely detached, Harry. Given our predicament.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno, Norman. With all your panic and running around, what have you accomplished?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Norman looks at Harry's unnerving, serene smile. Then eases back into the corridor, looks up and down for Beth...
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew I was running around?

</NORMAN>
<HARRY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I thought she was with the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What others? Barnes and Ted are dead, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Harry's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nobody down here who knows how to run the place anymore. The fire screwed up the electronics. We've used up most of our reserve gas...you're reading your book...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Harry is saddened by the news of Barnes and Ted. Then his gloom lifts suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look on the bright side, Norman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Barnes and Ted dead, we don't need as much gas. And with half this place flooded, we don't have to worry about filling that space with gas either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a helluva bright side, Harry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<HARRY>

	It is what it is.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Beth hustles inside. Heads for the refrigerator for a bottle of water...
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody has to go reset the minisub. If we don't reset it every twelve hours it floats to the surface. Remember?

</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

	See, there's another bright side, Norman.

</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?

</NORMAN>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Barnes and Ted dead -- the minisub only holds three people!

Norman looks at Harry, grinning at him.
</DIRECTION>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth, could I talk to you for a second?

<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think he'll leave without us?

</BETH>
<NORMAN>

	Oh, I think he's already left without us. I think Harry's in a whole 'nother place.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know he slept through the attack? You don't think that's a little strange?

</NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat between them as Beth considers this...
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess it's me and you, Norman. Just like I said at the beginning. It's good I have someone down here I can trust.

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and me Beth.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Norman...it's not like swimming, it's walking.

</NORMAN>

Then, up above the dashboard, he finds a flashing red button marked "TIMER HOLE" beside a digital clock that's running down... Norman presses it and a small screen glows...
</DIRECTION>

TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00

It starts counting down... Norman smiles with satisfaction.

NORMAN'S POV - THROUGH FACEPLATE

Of the habitat in the distance... Then the faceplate starts to fog up... Norman's view is a little woozy... Then he LOOKS DOWN at his gas hose as bubbles slowly start leaking out.

<NORMAN>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth, something's happened to my hose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>

ANGLE ON NORMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fumbles, all thumbs with gloves, his faceplate fogged...trying to tighten the valve where bubbles are coming from. Instead, he loosens it, and more bubbles are released.

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

Heavily fogged, he can dimly MAKE OUT the shaft of light coming down from the airlock.

The sea SNAKE HISSES, then snaps at Norman as Norman lets go, falls to the ocean bottom...

As the snake swipes at his face, its forked tongue smearing slime across the faceplate... then the snake scurries away as...

Norman and Harry exchange a look.

	You were supposed to be watching, Beth. That's the facts. You think Harry said something he didn't. That the cupboards are empty when they're full...Clinically, we would call that a psychotic break.

	I'm not crazy, Norman. What're you gonna do? Write me a prescription? Just get rid of me? Well, it's not that convenient down here, Norman, okay. I am not psychotic.

	Wait a minute. Now you want me to believe that the man set me up. Why? This isn't 'Alice in Wonderland'. Remember 'just you and me babe'? Is it unrealistic to think that at this point you are a danger to yourself - you are a danger to us...that your misguided anger towards me for something that I don't know what it was that happened decades ago is spewing out like poison. I was out there. You almost got me killed. The man tried to save my life! You now want me to disbelieve Harry?

	He makes it real for you, he makes it real for me...he has made it real for everybody. It's really frightening because you don't know whether it's really real or whether he's made it real for us to believe it's real, and it's because of the Sphere.

<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like an E-ticket ride for Harry's subconscious. It's the wildest ride you could imagine. It's the ultimate acting out. It's not that different when you're a child. A child when it imagines something, thinks that it's real, but it's not. In Harry's case, it's in fact so real that it's not only real to Harry it's real to all of us...and what I can't understand is that ever since he went in the Sphere, the Sphere has some kind of power that projects every subconscious thought that Harry has, out to the computer. It prints it out, and we interact with it. We thought it was Jerry. It's not Jerry, it's Harry. Harry's Jerry.

	So, what are we going to tell them?

</BETH>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't tell them that we found an alien sphere on an American spacecraft from our own future, and we definitely can't tell them we discovered the power to manifest, just by imagining, killer jellyfish, a giant squid, sea snakes --

<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They're definitely not ready for that.

</BETH>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The greatest discovery in the history of mankind, and we destroyed it. And it's better that we did. What if it fell into the wrong hands?

</HARRY>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were the wrong hands. That's the scary part, isn't it? All three of us, relatively enlightened, ethical, educated. We think of ourselves as good people. But when The Sphere gave us this power, what did we do with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORMAN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We freaked out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We were given the greatest gift in the history of mankind. We were given this magic ball and it says: "Imagine what you will and you can have it", and we're so primitive, we have so many fears that we carry with us, that we manifest the worst in us rather than the best in us....and that ain't gonna change.
	</DIALOGUE>

(off her look)
