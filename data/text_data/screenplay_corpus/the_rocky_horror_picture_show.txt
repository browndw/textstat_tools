It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom. They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear. They are a distorted version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding. A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium. It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator. A chandelier hangs above the tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone. Near the podium are some weights. Behind the tank is a vaulting horse. These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And paradise is to be mine.

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
GUESTS and everybody applaud. JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that she shouldn't.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was strange the way it happened. One of those quirks of fate really. One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost: you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He cracks the bones in his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the pieces seem to fit into place. What a sucker you'r been. What a fool. The answer was there all the time. It took a small accident to make it happen. An accident!

MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

	And step up the reactor power input three more points.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is lowered. It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquids bubble and change colour. The thing inside begins to look like a human form.

ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head. ROCKY looks at RIFF RAFF then at FRANK. With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.
</DIRECTION>

At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle. He winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the tank....because...

ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages.

	And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.
