<DIRECTION>
SIMPSON, an exec of about 45, balding on top wearing a three piece suit, is sitting on a 1890's style park bench. He is out cold. He starts to stir. He lifts his head, it appears as if it is day time. He looks around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMPSON's P.O.V. - The overhead lights are so bright, it simulates a mid day noon sun. There are even Dusk sky colors and clouds painted on the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMPSON is very confused....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around him to see several multi colored buildings and he appears to be on a checkered red and white brick road between two rows of buildings. He sees a miniature castle at the end of the road that is about 1/50th scale of another similar theme park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole room is about 600 yards long and it gets small as you go near the castle. There is a Merry Go Round just to the left of castle and there are only four doors on the entire street. One labeled "Movie Theater", the second labeled "The Old West", the third "Fantasy Land" and the last labeled "The Real World". The ceiling is as high as a high school gymnasium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From beside the miniature Castle comes a giant human sized SCRAPS THE DOG. A theme song starts to play over the intercom.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, the official mascot of Murderland.... Scraps the Dog !

</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Scraps is a human sized fluffy human in a dog suit. Scraps looks friendly as he waves and moves stiffly like he's animatronic. SIMPSON starts to laugh to himself. Then as the song is playing, Scraps pulls out a Tommy Gun and starts to shoot at Simpson.

Simpson is forced to go toward the Movie Theater. He goes in, barely missing the bullets.

INT. CONTROL ROOM, MURDERLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the action on television monitors. This room is set up like a Newsroom with about twelve T.V. monitors and computer counsels and mixing boards. At the controls in this dark room is BRUCE, late thirties, unshaven and cold as ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him are JOHNNY, his assistant, mid twenties and semi Italian looking, and lurking in the shadows is ZACH, a corporate ass kiss who wears $600 shoes and wears GQ glasses with his Armani suit.

The room is colored with blue light from the monitors and the electronic lights surrounding all the computer consoles. Behind the two seat console is the couch where Zach is sitting. This room is impeccably clean.

<DIRECTION>
Simpson is limping his way down the hall. There are doors of varying sizes and shapes on either side of him. Some have light emanating from behind them, some don't.

<DIRECTION>
It's important to note that there is no other light other than the light coming from behind the doors. Other than that it is pitch black in here. Only the doors present themselves.

Zach exits the elevator. He must go to the other end of the building to take the elevator to the penthouse.

He sees SAUNDRA, a mid twenties brunette who is wearing a very mini skirt. She is all business, but definitely has sexuality oozing from her pores. She is standing at the water cooler with another exec named JUDY, 38 and a little heavy set.

Saundra is at the table with about twenty other N.D. executives. They are watching the latest internal video from CEO JOHN C. McCAY.

This goes way beyond posh here. There are exotic paintings (originals) and lots of open spaces. Elephant tusks and other hunter type trophies. This is definitely a man's office from a man who suffers from penis envy. He has all the high brow, multi millionaire furnishings in dark wood and an outside fountain and arboretum. This room is at least three thousand square feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZACH enters with his briefcase in hand.
</DIRECTION>

From outside enters, John C. McCay, president of First Bank. He's in his mid to late fifties and all gray hair and a little portly. He wears glasses and presents himself as having power.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_C_MCCAY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACH>
<JOHN_C_MCCAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.

	I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?

<DIRECTION>
(starts to pace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir.

</ZACH>
<JOHN_C_MCCAY>

	I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_C_MCCAY>
<ZACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACH>
<JOHN_C_MCCAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_C_MCCAY>
<ZACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACH>
<JOHN_C_MCCAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_C_MCCAY>
<ZACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACH>
<JOHN_C_MCCAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_C_MCCAY>
<ZACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.

The CEO contemplates this for a while.

There is astro turf on the ground, bright soccer field lines and giant metal poles each one with either four, three or two "players".

The "players" are giant six foot tall versions of their three inch counter parts. They are lightly padded, but with enough force, they could be lethal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A five foot tall, white inflatable ball is already in play on the field. The ball could knock the wind out of you, but not fatally.

Bruce is waiting next to a hole that leads into the field. Saundra and Matthew drop down from the vent to see him waiting, gun in hand.

	I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.

	This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag.

As he passes a fax machine, it shoots out little white tubes (just like the old cylinders that fax paper used to be wrapped on). He trips and falls. His glasses fly off of his head.
