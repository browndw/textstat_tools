:SC: FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desert wind moans sadly. From somewhere within the wind comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after another on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen. A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain Of being a man." Dr. Johnson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred miles an hour. THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL, BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead. GONZO froths up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember saying something like: "I feel a bit lightheaded. Maybe you should drive..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO starts shaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face. The reflections of bats swirl within his eyes. We push in close to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and a voice was screaming: Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air. No bats anywhere. GONZO casually looks over...
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you yelling about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road. The sudden wrench makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind. It's your turn to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No point mentioning these bats. I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats, frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB. DUKE desperately rifles through the impressive stash.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had two bags of grass, seventy- five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi- colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives back into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground, weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A BAT?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RED SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a lousy driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_NEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death for pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_NEWS>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer. The RED SHARK fishtails.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a thumb. The RED SHARK roars past. Then, fifty yards down the road...
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's give that boy a lift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't stop here - this is bat country!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS. The HITCHHIKER races to the car. A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.
</DIRECTION>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot damn! I never rode in a convertible before!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DIRECTION>
Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER- NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right? Well, I guess you're about ready, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're your friends. We're not like the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(hissing sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED SHARK screams down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO sings along to the tape player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out and taking his chances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long could we maintain, I wondered. How long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling down GONZO's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with the words, sometimes not.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If so - well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(out loud to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Did I say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER giggles nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I better have a chat with this boy I thought. Perhaps if I explain things, he'll rest easy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(roaring over the road noise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(yells)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CAN YOU HEAR ME?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified. DUKE climbs into the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Because I want you to have all the background. This is a very ominous assignment -- with overtones of extreme personal danger. I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddamnit! This is a true story!...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(WHACKS the BACK OF
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE DRIVER'S SEAT
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
with his fist)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your hands off my fucking neck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom. DUKE GRABS HIM BACK DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our vibrations were getting nasty -- but why? Was there no communication in this car? Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(to HITCHHIKER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(HITCHHIKER shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about some ether?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<HITCHHIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HITCHHIKER>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD. They are the ELOI. HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS. ACTRESSES sip Singapore Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in the patio section, of course, drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and shades. GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank top undershirt. They are in the middle of a serious conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, the Salazar story is getting too complicated. The weasels have started closing in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The DWARF sneers.
</DIRECTION>
<DWARF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWARF>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A MOVIE SPY.
</DIRECTION>
<DWARF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was headquarters. They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda. He'll have the details. All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he'll seek me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWARF>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(GONZO tucks his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	khaki undershirt into his white bellbottoms -- he
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
means business!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE and GONZO are up and off. The DWARF chases after them with the (very large) check in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE and GONZO emerge.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing parking ticket to Valet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas... at least that's what the press release says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels. They jump in.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to have to drum it up on our own. Pure Gonzo Journalism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose- bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PINTO races through shot.

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back window full of Hawaiian shirts.

<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but the car and tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood.

INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE. DUKE carries over four Singapore Slings.

	O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take any guff from these swine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(GONZO slams the phone down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust. DUKE BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we were delayed en route when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrain.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We had trouble, again, at the car rental agency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with satisfaction -- checking it out. A nervous AGENT holds out a clipboard. DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say... uh... you fellas are going to be careful with this car, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good god! You just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you didn't even slow down! Forty-five in reverse! And you barely missed the pump!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No harm done. I always test the transmission that way. The rear end. For stress factors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say. Are you fellows drinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me. We're responsible people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic. The AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's another worrier. He's probably all cranked up on speed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL. In the moonlight: the silhouetted figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

	We spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the car. Then we ate some mescaline and went swimming.

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean. He lets himself float up through the silvery bubbles...

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING MOONLIT SURF.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our trip was different. It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with true grit...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

GONZO clutches his heart. The car veers off the road and screeches to a halt. He slumps over the wheel.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY. GONZO falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun. The HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits. The RIDER staggers off his bike. The PIT CREW gas it up and sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

	By 10 they were spread out all over the course. It was no longer a race, now it was an Endurance Contest. The idea of trying to "cover this race" in any conventional press sense was absurd.

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL. The radio blares: "THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS. A slant-eyed Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and stripes. A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side. They yell over the roaring engines.

An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.

DUKE and GONZO stagger in.

LACERDA drops his smile. He's standing beside the BLONDE TV REPORTER. A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.

DEAD SILENCE.

The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.

	Las Vegas at dawn. The racers are still asleep, the dust is still on the desert, fifty thousand dollars in prize money, slumbers darkly in the office safe at Del Webb's fabulous Mint Hotel...

DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD, MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES. No joy. DUKE watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are these people? These faces! Where do they come from? They look like caricatures of used car dealers from Dallas. And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at four-thirty on a Monday morning. Still humping the American dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute predawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino.

<DIRECTION>
He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub. Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface. A large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor. The shower is on -- the tub overflowing. THE TAPE RECORDER PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED UP WHITE BLOTTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

No answer.

<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.

</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.

</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
(coolly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a check?

</DUKE>
<GONZO>

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and leaves, closing the door behind him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want that fucking radio!

	Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE stares down at GONZO.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You're right. This is probably the only solution.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holds the PLUGGED IN TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me make sure I have it all lined up. You want me to throw this thing into the tub when "WHITE RABBIT" peaks. Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on. GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A TIDAL WAVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE slumps onto the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE.

GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused. HE WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at DUKE. DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MACE! YOU WANT THIS?
	</DIALOGUE>

GONZO stops -- hisses.

</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>

(mumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(menaces him with the MACE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back in that tub. Eat some reds and try to calm down. Smoke some grass, shoot some smack -- shit, do whatever you have to do, but let me get some rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, yes. You really need some sleep. You have to work. Goddamn. What a bummer. Try to rest. Don't let me keep you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom. DUKE wedges a chair up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next to the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE turns on the TV. WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM. He collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom. Just another ugly refugee from the Love Generation.

	My attorney had never been able to accept the notion -- often espoused by former drug abusers -- that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them. And neither have I, for that matter.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL LIGHTSHOW PATTERN. With DUKE still sitting in the foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I decided to eat only half at first. Good thinking. But I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do. C/U of the door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in slow-motion.

	Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD.

<DIRECTION>
The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm. A long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean- cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters. He freezes in horror. We cut to his POV. DUKE is standing in the middle of the men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side... sucking on his sleeve. A very gross tableau. The STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gets up, pours himself a drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has it been five years? Six? It seems like a lifetime -- the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains. Light streams in.

	THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE SPARKS ANYWHERE. THERE WAS A FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT, THAT WE WERE WINNING. AND THAT, I THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL. NOT IN ANY MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T NEED THAT. OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY prevail. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave...

Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN with a smile. The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves at the CAR BOY.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay calm. Stay calm. I'm a relatively respectable citizen -- a multiple felon, perhaps, but certainly not dangerous.

</DUKE>

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech. DUKE jumps in. The back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint 400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O CONT'D)

	Luckily, I had taken the soap and grapefruit and other luggage out to the car a few hours earlier. Now it was only a matter of slipping the noose...

Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition. A young CLERK arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. does that make sense?

<DUKE>

(barely able to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... It makes sense.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous stash inside.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.

	He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

<DIRECTION>
SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word or two.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

DUKE signals right. The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

The patrol car comes skidding around the corner. DUKE stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DUKE>

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer -- glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK. Amongst the bars of soap... A case of warm beer. DUKE smiles back at him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>

	You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.

	I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he signals to turn right into Baker. As he approaches the turn he sees the HITCHHIKER! As DUKE slows to make the turn their eyes meet. DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER drops his thumb.

	You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.

	Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

	Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

	NO! Stop talking like that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER -- waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings. She's starting to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands together as if washing his hands of the situation.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman type -- speaks from the podium. A banner behind him reads: NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod dress. Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be WITH IT! However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around 20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

	Now, there are four states of being in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square. The square is seldom if ever cool. He is not "with it," that is, he doesn't know "what's happening." But if he manages to figure it out, he moves up a notch to "hip."

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the bathroom. Immediate sounds of retching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone message light is blinking. DUKE opens a beer, picks up the phone.

	What's the message? My light is blinking.

	Holy shit!

DUKE slams the phone down. GONZO emerges from the bathroom -- looking like death.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucy called.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.

The telephone rings. DUKE answers.

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.

He hangs up. GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.

</DUKE>
<GONZO>

	She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?

	Wait! You can't leave me alone in this snake pit. This room is in my name.

DUKE KEEPS PACKING. GONZO is looking worried.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.

	Relax. Let me handle this.

<DIRECTION>
(dials the PHONE, snaps angrily at DUKE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd make a piss-poor lawyer. ...Room 1600, please.

	As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.

(nods towards bathroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE goes in the bathroom. He finds a little bottle -- a label: "DRINK ME."
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adrenochrome...

</DUKE>
<GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
(into PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it's me. I got your message...what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what? No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
(to PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But here's the problem. That bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference. They'll be looking for both of you. Yeah, I know, but you can't judge a book by its cover, Lucy. Some people are just basically rotten... Anyway, the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again; they'll trace the call and put you straight behind bars... no, I'm moving to the Tropicana right away. I have to go, they've got the phone tapped. Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but it's all over now... OH MY GOD! THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(throws the PHONE down; shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Get away from me! I'm innocent! It was Duke! I swear to God!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stomps the PHONE; moans)
</DIRECTION>

	No, I don't know where she is. You'll never catch Lucy! She's gone! I swear, I don't know where she is! DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!

<DIRECTION>
(slams the PHONE down)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. That's that. She's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now. That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fumbling with the hash pipe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the opium?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck. SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get this?

</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs -- struts
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	round DUKE -- eyes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
bright with expectation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they nailed this guy for child molesting. He swore he didn't do it. "Why should I fuck with children?" he says. "They're too small." Christ, werewolf is entitled to legal counsel. I didn't dare turn the creep down. He might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal gland!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE. DUKE'S BODY IS GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(spitting words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extract of pineal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
(STARING AT DUKE WITH A STRANGE SMILE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.

<DIRECTION>
GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.

<GONZO>

	Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...

<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fantastic!

<DIRECTION>
DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. His heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED, EYEBALLS SWELLING.

<DIRECTION>
GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.

GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.

	FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily... towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, that stuff got right on top of you, didn't it.

VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead. He is purplish-red. OVER THE TOP! Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you could just... shove me into the pool, or something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I put you in the pool right now, you'd sink like a goddamn stone. You took too much. Jesus, look at your face, you're about to explode.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles. Strokes, aneurysms. You'll just wither up and die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO PARALYSIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.

(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song -- right now, at this moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in. He lies, awkwardly twisted -- unable to move. He could have been there days -- months.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I came to the general back alley ambiance of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul. How long had I been lying there? Hours? Days? Months? All these signs of violence. What had happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving whisky and gorillas. Blue and red Christmas tree lights replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere, pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered on a shattered mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 AD.

<DIRECTION>
DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet -- HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds? Would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries? These puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau? Maybe so, but then why all this booze? And these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>

	These were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie. It was too savage, too aggressive.

DUKE unzips and pisses. THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE MAGNUM .357!

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE looks into the room. He sees GONZO's ass sticking out of the closet. He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF... sleeping on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE. He sees GONZO grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head. GONZO is muffling her screams with an ice bag.
</DIRECTION>
<MAID>

	Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...

DUKE shakes his head.

	Nobody. I'm the maid!

</GONZO>
<MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAID>
<GONZO>

</GONZO>
<MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAID>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MAID>

GONZO laughs.

GONZO stops -- turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<GONZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GONZO>
<DIRECTION>
GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live and too rare to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY. PULL BACK WITH THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky. Pull back to find DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM. He is typing on his typewriter.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled that 60's. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling "consciousness expansion" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT. The CAMERA slowly rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30 FEET HIGH. DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force -- is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN. The camera pans down to DUKE DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE. A piece of the fence flies out of the back seat as he takes a bump.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was only one road back to L.A. US Interstate 15, just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the Hollywood Freeway straight into frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity, just another freak in the Freak Kingdom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon sign that flashes beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh. Wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks. Gets out and walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR. Scattered all about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES. A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE RAFTERS. The sunlight shafts through high windows. AN OLD MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden bar. A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.
</DIRECTION>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll you have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(doubtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ballantine Ale...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold. DUKE SMILES AND RELAXES.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to find it served like this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER. The logo on the rack reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where ya comin' from, young man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Las Vegas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
(trustingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
A LOVELY GIRL appears. Seeing DUKE, she smiles. CAN THIS REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY? She approaches him... and... KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(caught off guard... muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
(not understanding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my granddaughter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans forward in confidence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(winks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just another good American like yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
A MOMENT. THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHO FEELS ASHAMED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE. Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE switches on the ignition. Something rolls off the trembling dash... DUKE catches it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES. THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP -- TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HOLY SHIT!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT THE MARINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE ROARS AWAY. AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My heart was filled with joy. I felt like a monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger... a man on the move... and just sick enough to be totally confident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</DIRECTION>
