<DIRECTION>
A very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. They are the trustees of the National Gallery. LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To his right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON fidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to speak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to fidgeting. So does everyone else.

:SC: EXT. MR BEAN'S STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks up the street, tutting slightly at a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes. The street is totally car-free except for a very visible lime green mini. A policeman strolls by and glances down at a pair of legs sticking out from under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on, satisfied that someone is mending their car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN approaches the car and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then unlocks the big padlock that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside, fiddles with something else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening speed with a smug look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound fault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight- line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But at the end of the alley, the traffic's just as bad. BEAN notices he's outside Harrods. There's a tail-coated Security Guard at the 'front door. BEAN watches him stroll a bit down the street - and takes his chance. He turns and drives straight through the double doors, into the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HARRODS. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and leather glove racks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a Security Guard. As he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car just shoots behind him. The Guard continues through the Children's section there are giant elephants and teddies, children's size cars, then two huge plastic tractors - and then, stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the Lime Green Mini with BEAN in it. The Guard walks straight past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see what it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street.

:SC: EXT. KNIGHTSBRIDGE. DAY.

Out in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: EXT. THE STRAND. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off, and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery and the mini.

BEAN gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and takes out a "Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the back window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re- locks the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work.

As he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that Board meeting was taking place.

:SC: INT. NATIONAL GALLERY. CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The Virgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. There are silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work, listening to a female GALLERY GUIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a coin. The coin drops and rolls into the special room. BEAN follows it into the darkness.

The camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. We hear the squeak of a tiny door open, then a click. The room is suddenly flooded in blazing white light. The onlookers gasp in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin. As an afterthought he pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. He scuttles away. The GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation. CUT TO: :SC: INT. NATIONAL GALLERY. BOARDROOM - DAY

CUT TO: :SC: INT. NATIONAL GALLERY. ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other people. He gives himself a long squirt of breathfreshener. Then offers it to the others, who politely refuse him. So he stands still again. Pause. BEAN then smells something unpleasant. He leans and has a little sniff of the person to his left. All right there. Then he sniffs to his right, and reels at what he smells. He again takes out the breath freshener, and forces it upon VINCENT, an elderly gentleman, who is mortified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the camera follows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters. He is another trustee. This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door.

BEAN, with cup of tea, walks along a corridor. He can't not interfere for tidiness sake. One empty room he switches off the light. Another he shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing in a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the door to his office. A sign reads: 'STORAGE & CATALOGUE'. There is a huge padlock on the door. BEAN takes out a big key and enters his domain.

:SC: INT. NATIONAL GALLERY. STORAGE OFFICE - DAY.

<DIRECTION>
BEAN enters. He's been here for years and made it his own. It's an odd little world. There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and Airfix planes hang from the ceiling. Also a large cosy armchair and a T.V.
</DIRECTION>

A pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in.

<SUIT_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht. Still Life. Circa 1670. Can do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUIT_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet high and long, the walls completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings. At the end of the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts, modern abstracts, men on horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's like the giant storehouse at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has now reached the sculpture area, but the painting heels looking for is on the other side. He crosses the room by using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course. In front of him is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as a slide and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern thing. He then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the mouths as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty eyes as finger holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then triumphantly pulls out a painting. It's the one!

BEAN walks along the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then comes to the room where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van Gogh portrait, is on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity, goes in to switch it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room - with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly going to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the back the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the Programmer comes back in.

With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on white, then pop out completely.

<BEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah.... Ahm....

BEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly. But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides down the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to breathe.

BEAN rounds a corner and walks towards us, imitating a bowlegged cowboy. The Theme from Bonanza plays. He whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters, spins them on his fingers and returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making gun sound effects. He's very happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws his gun on him - zero reaction the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are having a good giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting they're inspecting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the third girl heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting - but now has to try to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real long stretch away. He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which gives him the extra 3 inches. Again, safe. Just.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3 Graces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off his
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to cover all six nipples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other side of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what is on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others - with literally 40 graphically naked people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At which moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and scream in chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence and is in outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that they are screaming because he's beltless trousers have fallen down. CUT TO:

THOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks with DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to show he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance. Huge sign: 'THE GRIERSON GALLERY' with a silhouette of Whistler's Mother taken from the painting, as an incorporated logo.

Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze. No-one's going to get in through that door.

The Grand Man lights up a cigar. This doesn't please Mr "No Smoking BEAN. First, he waves the smoke away, in small, then big, then huge wafting motions. Then he tries, miming, to cut it up into segments and move them aside. The man pays no attention at all.

7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a bum-fluff moustache.

DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them.

The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON, has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are laughing in the car as DAVID walks up.

He is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID.

Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better - she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
9.30 p.m. U.K. time. A black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house with its motor idling. Its driver looks fed up waiting. BEAN appears at a downstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. MR. BEAN'S BED-SIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. BEAN is ready to leave his room. Battered old
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock. Even
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bean's old G.P.O. phone has one on its dial.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN looks across to his TEDDY, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside an up-sided cardboard box. The box is sits on an armchair. A hand-written sign, taped to its roof reads: 'TEDDY HOTEL' followed by three stars. A smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'FULL'. BEAN is just about to leave but stops to consider. Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars on the hotel hoarding, as a treat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various objects in the flat. The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg.

BEAN leaves his flat. lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door saying 'NO SMOKING". He now turns his attention to the pieces of string hanging out the letter box in his door. Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO back inside the flat. we now understand the string - as all the furniture starts to move across the flat. It works incredibly neatly the chair reaches the door
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN acts fast. He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's cup of tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A horrid experience for both.

:SC: INT. AEROPLANE - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns right, into the body of the plane. After walking right down the plane, he is directed by a hostess back up to first. As he walks back, we notice the' ridiculous contrast, from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of children and muzak, to the elegance, and space of First class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN couldn't be more thrilled. There follows a sequence of short moments from this nightmare flight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage. A hostess slides it into the compartment above her head.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful. It's for my Grand-daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
The next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the same locker, and tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes it violently. We hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there - BEAN slams the locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash. The OLD LADY looks at BEAN suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man, whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Champagne comes round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of nuts, and clinks glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress him by throwing nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well practised art). No response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face - straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his mouth, chews it into a spitball
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under high pressure, shoots
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS. Not a good start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But even he is wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards sleep. Next to him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and unfortunately, as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact with REYNOLDS' flies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked, comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him. Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open. He sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son isn't very well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill to be impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea. He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes, that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment.

</DIRECTION>

But soon he gains greater confidence. He stands up straight, both hands off the rail. There are a couple of COPS leaning against a wall, chatting. BEAN notices their guns. Slipping into role-play mode, he reaches into his breast pocket, ready to bring out his imaginary shooter ... The last security guard he tried this with just yawned ~ so BEAN thinks it's safe. But this time, the COPS turn and stare at him tensely..

Flustered by their interest in him, BEAN needs to get away. He turns, but finds that he is walking in the opposite direction, on the spot.

Key hiding is something he knows about - and people are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN picks up the FROG to reveal the front door key. It glints in the porch-light.

4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work. Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's working excellently.

5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from a booth and sees him in the mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising sex-with-machine position.

But as he exits, BEAN's face transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers on the scorching bulb.

He heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall - and BEAN and DAVID follow, still totally glued together. A strange sight.

<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very exciting stuff ....

</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Punching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery, and when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile. Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room. He moves
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
around the room, always facing straight to the wall. When he reaches the fan, he switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan - so to keep the wind on his trousers, BEAN has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following the arc of the fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very good Bernie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.

<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad, eh? What do you think, Doctor? Ah.... Doctor Bean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIERSON>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN turns, shocked to have been observed. He looks down at his trousers and, HOORAY!, they're dry at last. He's delighted, and moves back across the road towards them, hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin- thrusting, dry-trouser boasting walk.
</DIRECTION>

End of the day.. ANNIE perks up at the reception desk as DAVID, but especially BEAN, approaches from the gallery area. She has a pile of tissues near-by and draws a heart on one of them. She arranges it on the counter-top where BEAN could not fail to see it on his way to the exit.

CUT TO: :SC: EXT. THE GRIERSON GALLERY. BY PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask, performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman quickly moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass wall, and hits the MIME's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TP: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last. He
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the terrified MIME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50 yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded, leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same as this morning).

DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good. Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right, Bean, or ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Bean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just stay out of trouble, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods. DAVID gets out and heads for the mall. Nearby woman tramp (BAG LADY) goes through a trash can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to them as if to say: "Are these yours?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall, weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask. As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old friend, the MIME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his pockets ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN leans into shot. He holds out the keys, grinning.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme the keys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBBER>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman. He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, give me the keys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBBER>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground, the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face, ticking him off for breaking the rules.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBBER>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around. He does, sure this sicko is going simply to shoot him in the head. But instead BEAN puts his back to the ROBBER's back, and starts to count
</DIRECTION>
<BEAN>

ALISON and CHARLES are sitting up on stools, in the window of a coffee shop. ALISON laughs at something that CHARLES says. Their body language suggests a certain closeness. DAVID is saddened. He hurries away.

<ROBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, I'11 do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBBER>
<DIRECTION>
He draws. BEAN draws too. They fire. And BEAN really fires. To his amazement. Onlookers scream. BEAN throws the gun away in startlement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROBBER lunges for it ~ BEAN kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a dangerous implement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder. The ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and niftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few dollar notes spill out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his car. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the ROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles for the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car sirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has BEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting to their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS explaining what a hero BEAN has been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the fuss is about. He notices the BAG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LADY wandering away with her bags. Should he tell her that he has swapped one of them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered. A COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.

BRUTUS, the huge black detective from earlier, sits opposite BEAN at a table, smoking. He is looking at a photo. A close-up reveals it to be a full length one of BEAN and the ROBBER outside the mall with the ROBBER's face unmasked. BRUTUS eyes BEAN for a while. BEAN is terrified. BRUTUS taps the photo.

DAVID heads for Mr BEAN's room, and knocks cautiously on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(o. o. v)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAN>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID enters - Camera follows as DAVID finds his way through BEAN's washing hanging from strings across the room. BEAN is sticking things in a picture album.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, am I disturbing you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a kid. Always standing on his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16. DAVID smiles. BEAN mimes stupid disco dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID turns another page. It is a sequence of pictures of BEAN at famous UK locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street. They are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him at arms length with his Polaroid - so he never quite makes it squarely into shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on labels, going way back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a whole page of garden gnomes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of your folks here - Family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN starts to look for something in particular. DAVID uses the pause to broach the awful subject.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've been here twelve all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN has found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family that he took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the Polaroid of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck next to it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's anything sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no, he cant do it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... to say good night. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods. DAVID smiles and goes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	Spineless.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first morning without ALISON. "She's Gone" by Hall & Oats begins to play, a song full of yearning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID feels the other side of the bed. No-one there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the bedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it " He takes a towel from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone - she's gone" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all. BEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself, wearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.

DAVID sitting down at table, with BEAN, who is tucking in happily ~ eating a burger & bun with knife and fork. DAVID speaks after a longish pause.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bean can I ask you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?

BEAN thinks hard, then looks at his watch, makes his excuses and simple walks away.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
10 am U.K. time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on the T.V. A morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet away from a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles, stretching out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an angel. It rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied to its handle becomes taut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TP: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it. The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket. The T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard hotel'.

</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just ... take today shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods. He is not on David's emotional level here.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame. She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the flesh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

Sure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's Mother. BEAN nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors - in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green and a buzzer sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELMER>

He salutes, glares at BEAN and walks away. BEAN and DAVID enters the room. BEAN looks warily back at ELMER

<DIRECTION>
The room is very dark, only tiny lights in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay there. Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card. Buzz - click! The camera holds on BEAN, his eyes tight shut. The lights go up on BEAN's face, a magical golden glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Open now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Cut round - and there is this beautiful and very famous painting, lovingly shot. Music. Atmosphere. Glory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN opens his eyes and looks at the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmm. Nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods. DAVID leaves him. BEAN is still for a while and then goes up and inspects it closely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame. He blows it away fussily. He steps back to admire the painting. There is dust up his nose and... SNEEZE - all over the painting!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic. Then looks back at the painting. Unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark right across Mrs Whistler's face..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN checks his handkerchief. Yes, there's wet ink all over it. He finds the leaking pen in his pocket. 0 God. He takes out his shirt, spits on it and tries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it. He takes the painting down from the wall and has another go. NO GOOD! The ink just spreads right over Whistler's Mother's pure white collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN now looks round in panic. What the hell can he do? He goes to the heavy door - and looks out into the corridor. He hears someone coming, hides and sees a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley past, covered with a white cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back in - and has an idea. He goes to a little table in the corner and begins to take thing off it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. GALLERY. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, and BEAN emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered with a white cloth. Although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually has no legs. It is the painting covered with the table cloth. To make it a bit more convincing, BEAN makes an apt squeaky noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly similar trolley coming right towards him.' A problem. As they get close, BEAN suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming man.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(silently mouths)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the ... !!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAN>
<DIRECTION>
When the man turns, BEAN just twists his painting sideways and shoots past him. We see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when he looks back and BEAN is no longer there. He turns round to BEAN, who turns back to him with a totally blank and innocent look. BEAN sees an elevator and heads for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE GRIERSON GALLERY. ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the elevator, BEAN relaxes for a moment. He leans the painting against the wall and presses the third floor button. The bell dings.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEVATOR_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEVATOR_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open to a group of six very fat middle aged people. They all wear large badges declaring them to be members of a 'Diet Club'. They squeeze into the elevator along both sides of BEAN's trolley. There is a very, very, THIN WOMAN behind them who can't fit on.
</DIRECTION>
<THIN_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'll see you up there, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THIN_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The doors close. As the painting is wedged against the fat people's stomachs on both sides, BEAN is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking his watch. He nonchalantly, drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the trolley'. The bell dings.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEVATOR_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Third floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEVATOR_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. BEAN flips the painting onto its side and strolls out of the elevator. The 'Diet Cub, members stare, after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN heads on, squeaking - and at last sees what he's looking for. A men's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN enters, relieved. It is small, just a little sink, a towel and a toilet. About a yard wide - but the picture fits in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo!! The ink starts to come off. Massive relief. Then, alas, someone tries the handle of the door. BEAN speeds up. A knock. He peers out the keyhole. There are now 4 people waiting. BEAN is very worried.

DAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds. We can see the side of the whole gallery in shot as they talk.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping DU. Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'11 mention it to him. But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howls he getting on with the family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
We will be slightly distracted by the observation that Whistler's Mother, America's most valuable painting, is at this moment balanced on a very thin ledge three floors up - where Bean has put in, outside the Men's room window. A bird and then a couple more birds perch on it.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And howls Alison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's ... well, she's good.

	Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking.

	Isn't it?

</DAVID>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that way, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see BEAN's plan - he has emerged at a nearby window. He can't reach the painting at first. So he stretches further and further out the window. No good. Finally he has to go out on the ledge. He shoos away the birds, who then decide to settle on him instead. Finally he gets a hand on the painting. As he does so, he loses hold. He just manages to grabs a window before he falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, David. Always a pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Period.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way. Don't know what you think, Mr Vice President, but I've been hinting to the old man that someone's got to have the balls to take some sort of emergency measures around here - or we're all in the crap house. What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not necessarily. That's where this ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough.

<DIRECTION>
BERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and ....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: :SC: INT. GRIERSON GALLERY. STOREROOM - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through the window. He has the picture and is safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the picture down on a table. Darn! The birds have done their business on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs. This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening. The liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror, America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought. Removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back on Whistler's Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks a little like Danny de Vito.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately, there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more. Total destruction.

cloth. He closes the doors and rests a moment to catch his breath. He takes a step into the room and freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The very fat 'Diet Club, people are seated at easels, paint brushes poised. The very THIN WOMAN is standing in the centre of the room in her underwear with a Greek urn perched on her shoulder. All eyes are on BEAN, who exits very quickly.

BEAN gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him.

<DIRECTION>
He stands frozen for a second - and at that moment, a hand tries the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN leaps at it and stops. the handle turning. Then there's a knock. BEAN moves the big table in front of the door - he's barricading himself in. There's a famous Rodin sculpture in there - he shoves it along to block, the door as well. When he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it - and a door on the other side of the room calmly opens and .... DAVID walks in.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods, knowing he deserves his doom.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the picture?" And I say - "me". And they say "you're fired". And I say ' right'. And so I get fired and you go to jail and no one's any happier.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then they say, "firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute him for negligence. And they prosecute me and it turns out I was negligent and I go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a cell with Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse, I end up in the same cell as you!

BEAN shows it to him.

	Jesus!!! I'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise. 5 minutes ago - just walking along, shooting the breeze with my old pal Bernie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN then he has a brilliant idea. He hangs the painting back up in the security cupboard and closes the doors. Then he removes from his pocket a small note book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on the cupboard door. It reads `OUT OF ORDER'.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brilliant. Brilliant. Problem solved!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is delighted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the cupboard will say -"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's Mother- let's kill them".
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is less delighted.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it. Ever again!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He locks the cupboard with his plastic card key-

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the first thing. Then ... that's the first thing.... Next ... next is the next thing which is... obviously... ritual suicide. Look, let's get out of here. Try to act natural.

BEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The colours are beginning to fade. However ~ if you give me just one little year I can restore the picture to its original glory, the way it looked when Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said.... 0 Actually I'm not sure you've got the hair right, darling." By the way, your hair is looking great today, sir.

<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIERSON>

	is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.

	No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

DAVID lets out a little yelp.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their drinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the sports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much whisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit and paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite, slurs his words:
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job - lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He fills his glass from a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't get it. The New Artist exhibition-this year - people might not all have liked the dead sheep, but ... the place didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't full but I saw people. I just don't understand how the gallery can be so bankrupt they have to sell the Whistler.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril. DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely ....
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's English, okay? You wanna make something of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought, taking a huge swig from his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then, I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut high into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it with his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine. Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself. Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I tell you something, Beanie ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Bean has been interested all this, even looking to check whether David does indeed have no spine. But now the baseball on the TV is making it hard for him to concentrate on-this important confidence. He raises a finger, for DAVID to be quiet for a second. He blows a peanut from his, nostril at the T.V. - it hits the button, and changes station to a pleasant quiet-music station.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods his head, very curious, listening hard.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it. Because you moved into my house, my wife has left me. She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton weight that broke the camel's spinal column.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN stares at DAVID - something is getting in he's actually registering this.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's point one. And point two - is that you've destroyed Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where I work. So within a week, I'm going to lose my job as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods, seriously dispirited.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been better if I'd never been born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on BEAN'S shoulder. BEAN looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very sad. This is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that his actions have really effected the life of another person. BEAN looks up sadly. Sad music plays.

BEAN is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back. Thinking. Worried by what he's heard. Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes. The music is like his brain He jumps off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence. But the 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre. BEAN picks up his suitcase, and in quick cuts, rushes through the house and collects....

BEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan will be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee, watching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is a massive gorilla of a man.

Inside, BEAN is casually pouring the entire contents of DAVID's large laxative tin into BUCK's coffee. He also swaps two keys on the board of keys by the desk. He then takes the opportunity to put the oven gloves on his feet, one shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so he can move silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUCK returns. He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. Pause. BEAN watches. BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. He takes a key from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen, BEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor BUCK is at full sprint. BEAN giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key- rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRST: BUCK - his next 10 minutes are not happy ones. When he reaches the toilet, the key he chose does not unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all the keys, and charge back again to the door. Then he has to try out every single key. We never see him find the right one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECOND scenario - all the activities of the night shown on the security monitors. BUCK sprinting desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about his business and, on one occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not seeing him - he has other things on his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4 encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with DAVID's key card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The job is done. He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off.

The final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, "we're getting ready" music.

1. Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc. And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in the gallery flickers and starts up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3. ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational. She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an imaginary V.I.P.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4. ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat with scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them proudly with his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5. GRIERSON watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out from the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car.

Close on the bottom of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs, wearing black shoes and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As they walk purposely up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to reveal that this is BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by GRIERSON at the main entrance.

BEAN at the computer. He's actually quite enjoying himself now. In fact, he's rather hogging the thing. This is, after all, an animated catalogue - his area.

<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything. Truth is, she smells kinda nice. okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN smiles and gives KEVIN a thumbs-up. KEVIN returns the gesture and exits..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to the computer, BEAN clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground floor gallery. He clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting of the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt. BEAN clicks and enlarges the painting to fill the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He happily hums the catchy tune from 'GOBLINS 2' and homes in on the tiny padlock on the chastity belt. Padlocks interest him. He clicks on the keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in GOBLINS 2).
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Click! click! click! click! click!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
.Suddenly, to BEAN's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red...then the whole screen starts to flash ... before going dramatically back to black ... Now flashing in the .centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key. Beneath it, a row of six dashes appears (e.g - - - - - - - ). A cursor is flashing over the first dash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is totally absorbed. He loves these kinds of puzzles. With one finger, he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of them). As he does so, they appear over each dash in turn:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G-O-B-L-I-N A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" BEAN tries something 0 else. G-N-O-M-E-S The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making BEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How goes it, Bean? Ready for the Governor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN smiles and nods nervously. He knows he's probably up to something he shouldn't be.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more. Period. Oh, And put this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE throws BEAN a name badge with 'Dr. Bean' on it. BEAN nods. BERNIE exits. BEAN goes back to the code. He types in the first thing that comes into his head:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B-E-R-N-I-E
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That damned message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. Then, as though something is dawning on him, he punches in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P-E-R-I-0-D
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up comes a message: "CODE ACCEPTED". Close on BEAN's face as light from the computer plays on it- He reads it carefully and with interest. We cant quite read his expression - but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle. Long meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before heading on.

BRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him. They are the Police presence today.

BERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and follows the Governor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door, thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to delegate.

BEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact. Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the one he's used to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't large enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process. BEAN looks a tadge concerned.

BEAN sitting in the wedged car. He tries the door - but it won't open a centimetre. He's totally stuck. He looks up at a small window in the roof. If only he could get that open. He pushes various buttons, which set of windscreen wipers, squirters, radios. He pushes the cigarette lighter. Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet pops up an inch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the seat beside him. Not good news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN panics a bit, turns and half climbs over into the back seat, when he spies a drinks cabinet. He has a very good idea - he finds a cut crystal decanter of brown liquid, opens it and uses it to douse the fire. Not a wise move with brandy. Before the cut, we see the WHOOOSH! of a major fire in the front seat of the car.

We see the car from above. Full throttle. Totally still. Totally still. And then WHOOOOSH WHAM!!! It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing violently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens, Bernie's car.

BEAN is inspecting the car. He's not too happy with it. '.He tries to get the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. He shrugs his shoulders and gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by leaning his head out. This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that appears out of the ground. When he hits it, the car stops dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN gets out, leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the attendant would be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. Inside he pushes a couple of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier. Less hurrah, he has forgotten to put on the hand brake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the outside of the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly sharp turn, smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. We hear a crash - but do not see where it lands.

A chauffeur driven, open top limo, pulls up next to DAVID's car. BEAN looks out of his window to see the BAG LADY, from the mall robbery, sitting in the back. She is still wearing her filthy clothes. She raises a glass of champagne to BEAN and smiles.

Inside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position. There are 3 attending nurses and an assistant doctor. They all look up to BEAN as he enters, fully kitted up.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<NURSE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's coming round.

<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him a T 70, straight away.

</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
The victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time. It is the police officer, BRUTUS. He is in great pain. As the sedative shot goes in, BEAN takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. A look of total panic goes over BRUTU'S eyes, as he loses consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I do the cut, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN nods - he's not going to argue with anyone. The assistant cuts. BEAN is horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. He can't believe this maniac has just cut through another personas flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support systems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
EVERYONE turns to get on with their particular jobs. BEAN is left with the body. A pause. He gets a little bored. Takes a sweet packet out of his pocket. Only one sweet left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he always does - throws it up into the air, to catch it in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask. It hits the middle of the mask and bounces into the cut in the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN looks down annoyed. Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy. So he puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers. ..Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. At which second the X-ray arrives.

<ASSISTANT>

	Here we go, doctor.

BEAN tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers.

Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first. He's young, confident slightly arrogant.

<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice- President.

CUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this.

	Thank you, sir. Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIERSON>
<DIRECTION>
BEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods sagely.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So, surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say, one helluva little man. Watch this.

<DIRECTION>
Everyone is totally at a loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster of Whistler's Mother on the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An electric motor starts to whirrrr ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original oil of Whistler's Mother.

There are gasps from the room. BEAN is open mouthed.

GRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively. He's saved!

<GRIERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best security in the world is no match for a master criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank you all.

happening. GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression.

	Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite bathroom.
