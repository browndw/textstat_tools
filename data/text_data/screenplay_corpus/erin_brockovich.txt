EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops, Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE- HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop. So high it hurts to look at them. As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see they're leaving a 99-cent store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS. Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break. The men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman. In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the tops of her thighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle-eyed. Eye-catching is an understatement. All those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A side street. No pedestrians, just parked cars. A PARKING TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice. Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally CLATTER to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hyundai starts it up, signals. Then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median. It SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost. And stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded by strip malls. Definitely not where the power lawyers work.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSALIND>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Mr. Masry. How you doing today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALIND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Generic. Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art. A sign over the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand. He's in his mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM -- already rumpled.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated. He trundles off toward his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner. She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony Marvin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His dry cleaners. You want him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think? What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tequila. From your drug dealer friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a low-life. Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Ed peers into his office. It's a mess -- papers everywhere, unopened mail. Standing in the middle of the room is Erin, in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress. As she jiggles a spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously. Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Brenda)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her fault, she says.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Lap-dancers are people too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't find him, Tony. We'll have to call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin -- hi. Sorry you had to wait. Here, sit down, sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He clears a stack of papers off a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she sits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you, I never thought just standing would take it out of me, but ever since that shithead hit me, it feels like my whole body's put together wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you poor thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, listen, you came to the right place. Whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make him pay for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>

	Why don't you tell me what happened?

INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to Ed, who's questioning her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was pulling out real slow, and out of nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits nobly in surgical scrubs. His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS are behind him. A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck. I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
STILL LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
STILL LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
STILL LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I know.

INT. COURTROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is still on the stand. But now the doctor's lawyer is questioning her.
</DIRECTION>
<DEFENDING_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventeen thousand in debt. Whew. Is your ex-husband helping out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning shock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's more than one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. There's two. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin looks over at the jury. The personification of conservative family values. Oh, shit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(getting defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... not like a career, cause I had my babies. But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't have this neck thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem. Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. No doubt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances. Great.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STILL LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive. Erin's starting to feel the case slipping away.
</DIRECTION>
<DEFENDING_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(pointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.
</DIRECTION>
<DEFENDING_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Broke, three kids, no job. A doctor in a Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good meal ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEFENDING_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement. She's on a sinking ship.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Hey -- he hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DEFENDING_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you say.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came tearing around the corner, out of control --

INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out, furious. Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open and shut? Open and fucking shut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you hadn't used profanity --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please, it was long over by then. God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you the questions might get a little personal --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. You told me I'd get half a million dollars. You told me I'd be set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Settle down? I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry! I can't afford to settle down!

Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Erin.

</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well, fuck you. Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge. The Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white baby. This is MRS. MORALES.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MORALES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Erin! You're back so soon. How was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORALES>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Erin the baby. It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old. Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where are Matt and Katie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<MRS_MORALES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORALES>
<DIRECTION>
The truth is too depressing to share.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be fine, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<MRS_MORALES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORALES>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<MRS_MORALES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her.

</MRS_MORALES>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're moving away? When?

</ERIN>
<MRS_MORALES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next week.

</MRS_MORALES>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(stunned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, that's soon --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<MRS_MORALES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But it's good for me. Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too. Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MORALES>
<DIRECTION>
Oh, God. In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin carries Beth up to her house. As she nears her door, she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG. It crunches under her sole.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Insult added to injury. She heads up to the house, dragging her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as dull inside. Salvation Army furniture. A lot of beige. Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are at the table. Beth is in a baby seat. Erin spoons some Mac & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.
</DIRECTION>
<MATTHEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like this part, it's all crusty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATTHEW>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the crust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Erin switches the plates.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you're not eating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Cause there isn't enough food.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mamma's gonna eat later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more. Thick, sick-sounding coughs. Erin looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go getting sick on me, baby. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with STEAM. Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap, trying to steam the illness out of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
But her face doesn't look like she believes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles. She stops at the medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself, glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, remember me? I was in yesterday. Bought a whole mess of stuff? Round about five?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<CHECK_OUT_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, it's a zoo here at five. I'm lucky if I even see a face, much less remember it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHECK_OUT_LADY>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough. Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here some medicine, and by the time I got home, I realized I'd bought the adult stuff by mistake. And now, wouldn't you know, I can't find the receipt. I was wondering -- could I maybe exchange it anyway ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just remember. No matter what your Mamma does, lying and stealing is real bad. I don't ever wanna hear you doing something like that ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
On the table beside her sit the classifieds. Row after row of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red. A WATER BUG crawls across the edge of the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear me? No excuse at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Midday. Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand. As he heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files. Coffee sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it!

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She pops her head in.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>

	Yeah?

</BRENDA>

He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this doing here?

</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's those files you asked for.

	I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office, he notices, on the other side:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's mentally challenged office boy. Mario heads away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

</BRENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<MARIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She works here.

</MARIO>
<DIRECTION>
Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all stealing glances at Erin. Ed comes up to her, all friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin! How's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never called me back. I left messages.

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did? Wow, sorry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Mario's a little not so bright. He seems to think that you said --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to. You did both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of this. Ed lowers his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never lied. I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said things would be fine, and they're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need pity. I need a paycheck. And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn. So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I have a full staff right now, so --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. If you had a full staff, you'd have time to return your damn phone calls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's backing him into a corner here. He shifts gears.

	I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry. I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on. I trusted you. With my kids' well-being. Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything. But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.

Ed glances around the room. Not a whole lot of options here. He looks back at Erin.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves. ANNA, the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files. That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that. We file 'em all here, alphabetically --

</ANNA>
<ERIN>

	Oh, hell.

He turns, sees her.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>

	Yeah?

</ED>
<ERIN>

	I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck? Just -- for the weekend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane's the office manager. She handles payroll and petty cash. But she leaves early on Fridays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Okay. That's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>

Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Christ's sake ...

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out his wallet, looks in.

He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves. When he's gone, she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a great big kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's. Katie and Matt pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag of groceries in the other. Katie and Matt are each carrying a bag of groceries as well. They are all singing and moving with the jaunty step of the newly carefree. Katie spots a flower display outside the store.
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy, can I get a flower?

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A small room with Salvation Army furniture. A BUNCH OF DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table. Matt and Katie are asleep in bed. Erin looks down at them, smiles, then kisses them good-night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door. But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING. It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be Mrs. Morales's house. A few MOTORCYCLES are parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
But of course he can't hear her. She walks over to him, stands right in his line of vision.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
He sees her and kills the engine. Everything about GEORGE HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long hair. Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hello to you, darlin'.

</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm the neighbors. There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
The guys on the porch chuckle. Erin turns and starts back to her house. George hops off his bike and follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different. Let's start over. My name's George. What's yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Gimme your number, I'll call you up proper and ask you out and everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops at her porch, turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

	You want my number?

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got more than one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a little girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is. Seven is my son's age. Two is how many times I been married and divorced. You getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and heads inside. He calls out after her:
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell do you know your bank balance right off the top of your head like that? See, that impresses me.

</GEORGE>

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morning. Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb. She passes the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling. Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge. They both check out her short hem. Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well. Erin glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at her judgementally. She stops in her tracks and stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'all got something you wanna discuss?

The women go back to stirring their coffees. Erin walks on.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>

He plunks the box of files on her desk. She stares at it, with no idea of how to go about that.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Okay.

</ERIN>

He sees her staring at the box.

</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.

</ERIN>
<ANNA>

Katie and Matt are running up to the house. Erin follows, toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the other. She steps on another water bug.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, why're you giving me such a hard time? I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Erin turns to him. The kids are waiting at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a good neighbor, George. She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free. Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need help with your kids? I could probably do that.

George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.

<ERIN>

	I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<GEORGE>

	Yeah, and whose fault is that?

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He's got a point there. After a beat:

	How?

	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Another deadbeat.

<GEORGE>

	I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>

	I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.

	It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.

</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She starts cleaning up the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. I like how they keep it all simple, you know? They don't get all complicated about life, like grown-ups do. A bicycle and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Erin thinks about the offer.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're around every afternoon?

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. Usually working on my bike.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she's tempted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Tempting. Erin looks him over.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wee hours. Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress on the floor. The paperwork from the box is now spread all over the floor around her. She's reading a letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE LETTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving. We see the phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a list of comparable house sales in the area. Owner, cost; owner, cost. Every house is in the $65,000 range.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING. Still reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib. Beth quiets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest. She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE FILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It contains a letter from a Dr. Howard Reeves. The first paragraph contains the phrase "... medical examination of Donna and Peter Irving ..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns. One is headed: "IN RANGE". The other: "OUT OF RANGE". Under that head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin stares at it, confused.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was in this real estate file I'm valuing. And -- see, I know they're the medical records from the people selling the house -- but it talks about things like lymphocytes and T8 suppressers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane. She lowers her voice, so he won't see her asking for help.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are. I thought maybe you'd know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I look like, Erin? A library?

And Jane walks away with her coffee.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. UCLA MAIN LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large. Looming. Very establishment. Through the windows, we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN. She has the file in her hands. Over this:

</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she talks to the LIBRARIAN. He checks something on the computer. A couple of WHITE-COATED MEDICAL STUDENTS pass her, double- taking. They don't see many like her around here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UCLA SCIENCE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents. Erin gets off an elevator and heads down the hall. She finds a door with a nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and KNOCKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears. He's a classic scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses. Nothing like Erin has ever shown up at his door. He reels at the sight of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Paulsen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<PAULSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<PAULSEN>
<DIRECTION>

BAXTER, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<BAXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAXTER>
<DIRECTION>
Baxter and Erin look at each other. No recognition, of course. Paulsen is immediately embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<PAULSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(mortified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! Oh, gosh, of course --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Orderly chaos. Dr. Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's file in his hands. Erin is sitting across from him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names? Shanna and Ashley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, I guess those are the kids --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<PAULSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong. And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<PAULSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wow. That's more serious than Erin was expecting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE FILE on the kitchen counter. The Irvings' phone number is written on the front. A PHONE IS RINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa! Easy, easy, easy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the table. Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi! You've reached the Irvings. Leave a message and we'll get back to you just as soon as we can. Bye-bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BEEP. Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the file. Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in Hinkley, California.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A. DISCO MUSIC blares from its speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a dry, desolate part of California. No downtown, no community. Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA. POP: " but the corner where the number would be has broken off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin looks around. The house she's passing has been razed. A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road. Erin passes it without noticing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops at an intersection. The house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood. Erin notices it -- depressing -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing. There's a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property. No landscaping. Dull, but clean. A few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops. Erin gets out. As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into the dirt. She rings the bell. It has a melody chime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DONNA IRVING opens the door. She's 35, petite, with a scrappy, high-strung manner. She's wearing tight jeans, and her dark curls are piled on top of her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Donna Irving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lawyer?

	Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care. Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows. Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a real nice place you got here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I think so too. That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing. I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it. And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains. Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy. You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up. I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records. They kinda surprised me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self- pitying. But not Donna. Life's handed her a shitload of lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease. That's a kind of cancer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know. And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy. Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts. All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say. Holy moley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can see that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Donna tops off their iced teas.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding? With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk. I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet. Paid for a check-up for the whole family. And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either. They just took care of it. Just like that. We never even saw a bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Why would they do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause of the chromium.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A BOX, with "CHROM INFO" scrawled on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PG&E came around a few years ago, told us they put chromium in our well by mistake. And since we shouldn't have to drink it if we don't want to, they gave us free spring water and offered to buy our house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's chromium?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor. But hunh-uh. Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She rifles through the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the info they gave us. You'll see if you look through it, chromium's good for you. When I saw what they charged for it at the health-food stores, I about fainted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Erin a printed fact sheet. Erin scans it.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not around here. This is a rough part of the world. Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin's driving away from Donna's house. A street lamp throws light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at the massive COMPRESSOR STATION. Six stories high, lit up like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it. Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns onto Community Boulevard and drives away.
</DIRECTION>

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George settles in, helps himself to sugar.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

	I was talking to this lady -- she and her husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's cause they live in a bad neighborhood. You think that's possible? That living in a bad neighborhood could give you cancer?

George laughs a little at the thought.

	I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff. And their pets are fine. So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<PAULSEN>

EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus with him. He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia, Birkenstocks, bushy beard. He's as dry as dust, and as much as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of chromium is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKEL>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's more than one kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<FRANKEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKEL>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<FRANKEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKEL>

He rattles it off coolly. Just facts. Erin's stunned.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that stuff -- it kills people.

Drab, government-issue. ROSS, the bored desk clerk is thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK. Just as he stops to stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew! Goddamn, that's a heavy door.

	I wish I knew. It's for my boss. He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. Would that be okay?

She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files. They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande, Helendale -- in no particular order. Finally, Erin spots one that says Hinkley. She pulls it down.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house. Erin shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of stuff off the seat, and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs into the MAILMAN. He hands her a packet of mail.
</DIRECTION>
<MAILMAN>

Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh -- Jesus --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps and brushes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>

She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard. Erin chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it, I'll get it later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into killing that one bug.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, you little motherfucker --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt, the pepper, the napkin holder. Erin keeps after it, BANGING the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, whoa -- relax --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
The salt and pepper skid off the table. The napkins fly from their holder. Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears. Erin hurls her shoe at the crack. It SMASHES into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GOD DAMN IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears. She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.

He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very close. He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on her foot. Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm no good, George. I make people miserable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
But he kisses her anyway. And for the first time in so long, she feels like something other than a failure. He pulls her into him, and she lets herself be pulled.

Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top.

<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fax these to this number, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of 'em?

</BRENDA>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of them.

He continues into his office and closes the door.

Brenda types in the number. The recipient's I.D. comes up on the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands. She's on her couch with Erin, reading them. Outside, Donna's two daughters are playing in the pool. She reads the last page and looks up at Erin, bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An on-site monitoring well? That means --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me. They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. But the toxicologist I been talking to? He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Donna resists this idea hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said. He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this. The only sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back. Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing -- her kids playing in toxic water. She jumps up ...
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ASHLEY! SHANNA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
... and runs out to the pool. Erin follows her.

EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool in a frantic response to this news.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OUT OF THE POOL! BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE POOL, RIGHT NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<SHANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANNA>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT! OUT! NOW!!!

Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids out of the contaminated water.

It's morning. Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his reflection in the window. Erin is on his couch, high-heeled legs stretched out in front of her.

Jane is delivering paychecks. When Brenda gets to her desk, Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it out. Brenda peers in and sees Erin.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hired her back. With a raise.

</JANE>
<BRENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRENDA>
<JANE>

	Well, let's see. It's not cause she's smart, and it's not cause she's professional. That leaves ...

Brenda's stunned. Takes a beat. Makes assumptions.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you think we got 'em scared?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.

Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.

	David Baum from PG&E is at reception.

Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.

	Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.

<DIRECTION>
Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception. Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of twelfth grade. Not a hair on his chin. His suit and shoes look brand new.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to question your judgment or anything, Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look like sitting up and taking notice to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement. He doesn't talk; he squeaks.
</DIRECTION>
<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in the interest of putting this whole thing to rest, PG&E is willing to offer the Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAUM>
<DIRECTION>
Ed laughs a little in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	250,000?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAUM>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAUM>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Baum doesn't answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Ed shoves them across the table. Baum doesn't look at them.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything the Irvings have had is a proven reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium. They've had ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He stalls a moment. Erin jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma, chronic nosebleeds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously the party line:
</DIRECTION>
<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A million things could have caused those problems. Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle. Our offer is final and more than fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAUM>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will present your offer to my clients. I doubt they'll accept it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
As Ed starts out:
</DIRECTION>
<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here. PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAUM>
<ED>
<DIRECTION>
(containing his anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

And Ed leaves the conference room. Erin follows him out.

Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least they made an offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get why they'd do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you think I'm made of money?

Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.

<BAUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you know where I can get a cab? My plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.

</BAUM>

Ed turns and looks at him. He gets a tiny smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<BAUM>

</BAUM>

Baum heads out to the reception area.

	Yeah. Isn't that a shame?

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

End of the day. Most everyone has left. Erin is at her new work space near Ed's office. She's poring over a fat file of documents. ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSALIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been reading for hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALIND>
<ERIN>

Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's. These are MANDY and TOM BROWN. He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope under his arm. Rosalind points to Erin. The Browns enter the office and approach her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve, maybe thirteen.

	It sure could, yeah. Thanks a lot.

	She doesn't know. No one does. It's not something you want to talk about, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<MANDY>

	Look, I know you're mad. But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them. Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.

	You think I could leave without kissing my babys? Okay, here you go.

He kisses into the phone. Swerves. A car barely misses them. Erin's eyes widen. Not fun at all.

	If PG&E messed with our water, why would they bother saying anything about it to us? Why not just keep quiet about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To establish a statute of limitations. See, in a case like this, you only have a year from the time you first learn about the problem to file suit. So PG&E figures, we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the people the water's not perfect; if we can ride out the year with no one suing, we'll be in the clear forever.
	</DIALOGUE>

	But it was more than a year ago that they told us --

</DONNA>
<ED>

<DIRECTION>
(to the Browns)

Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's. Solid, family folks. But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that she's in a lot of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly what it was that you had --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they know what it is -- it's called fibrous dysplasia --

He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's chair in Matthew and Katie's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep. Erin hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something, George. What kind of God lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get brain cancer? Isn't He supposed to be in charge of stuff like that? Make sure it doesn't happen?

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy -- why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I said no. Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute. We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility. No, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>

They go into their office building.

Erin and Ed are riding up.

</ERIN>
<ED>

</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation. They'd completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

<ERIN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin's dogging Ed down the hall, to the office.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry. Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too. That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how DNA works, Erin --

	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>

INT. ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed goes over to his desk, sits down. He sees a stack of messages there, starts flipping through them. Then he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands. He sits like that for a moment, GROANS to himself. Then he pushes himself up and heads over to his door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly where he left her, arms crossed. She hasn't budged.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many families we talking about here?

	You think there's more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967. A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it. I'll take it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles victoriously.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He heads back to his desk. Erin follows him into his office.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a big job. A hell of a lot bigger than just filing. I'm gonna be working a lot harder now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a look. Knows what's coming.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another raise wouldn't hurt. And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?

</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOYS 'R' US - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You each can pick out four things. But nothing huge. Look at the price. Nothing crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Matthew and Katie fan out into the store. Erin keeps messing with the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but come Monday, when you split again, they're still gonna be pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Erin looks over at him, weary.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off. Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life. They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.

EXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY

Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch, scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic containers. Over this:

<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich. Tell me something: if I wanna find as much evidence of hexavalent chromium contamination as I possibly can, what should I do?

As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked "No Trespassing". Her arms are full of more containers.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what you have to remember is, if you have hex chrom in the water, you have it in anything that lived off the water.

She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the trunk of her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'd do is start a collection. Anything that existed in water, on water, under water ...

</FRANKEL>
<DIRECTION>
She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of rancid pool water and seals it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	anything that had water flow over or under it ...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WELL - DAY

<DIRECTION>
With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts shimmying down the well.

<FRANKEL>

INSIDE THE WELL

	Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them. But you know what? They're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She heads into the bedrooms.

	If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.

</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?

</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your voice down.

Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of files. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

</ERIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ross is speechless. He just stands there. Erin drags the box to the floor and goes to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin's car is parked in front. A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes rumbling up the road. When its lights hit Erin's car, it slows, then pulls over. The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to get a better look at the car. The truck sits there for a bit, a dark presence. Then, as the headlights of another car appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth? My Beth?

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway, feeling all hollowed-out.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd never seen that before -- someone's first word. Pretty intense.

</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking at her. She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.

Open pits, pony rides, watermelon. George is watching Katie and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped being fun hours ago. Now they're just hot and tired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they sign retainer agreements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN. The water is green.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was the community pool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>

Erin's trunk is open. She and Ed are clipping new clusters of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.

Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets. She sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.

</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin. He heads over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he dropped. It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET. He's in his 50's, strong and sinewy. Military-style dark glasses obscure his eyes. He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working the crowd. Watches her carefully. He slides the pamphlet into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.

<DIRECTION>
LATER STILL ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave, when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin, this here's Frank Melendez. He works over at the compressor station --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER STILL ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees her car drive off. George's hand sticks out the driver's side and flips her the bird. She watches him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. What were you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
LATER ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barbecue is winding down. Ed is heading for his Mercedes. Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.

<ERIN>

	I need a ride.

Ed is driving. He glances over at Erin, fuming in the passenger seat. After a beat:

<ED>

	You wanna talk about --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat. Then Erin's cel phone rings. She digs into her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can. Answers.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, asshole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a pause. Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the line, very strained:
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_AMBROSINO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, Erin? This is Mike. Ambrosino.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains are drawn; everything is dark. Ed and Erin are at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was about to take a handful of these --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a morphine thing -- for pain --

Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:

Erin opens the door. Very dark, very quiet. Laura is lying in bed. Erin goes over to her. They speak in whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm embarrassed.

</LAURA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. I understand.

</ERIN>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just -- the pain. It's only getting worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be a good mother.

</LAURA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm real sorry, Laura.

Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed. Takes a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin? A Jaguar.

</LAURA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jaguar's a darn pretty car.

	I don't even know how much they cost.

Laura shakes her head.

Erin watches her sadly.

INT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD, industrial plant. Erin and Frank Melendez walk through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress. Both in hard-hats. He's giving her a tour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the sidewalk. As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER. He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the stroller, Beth starts to whine. George reaches in his pocket, finds her pacifier. As he's leaning down to give it to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him. The roar grows. He stands, looks. A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN BIKERS has pulled up next to him. He looks at them. They look at him, then at the stroller. George feels ridiculous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out. George just stands there and watches them go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His office is all about Hinkley. A map of the plume area and a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive. Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They covered 'em over. And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what caused the contamination?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for a document, reads from it.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground. But guess what --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They skipped that step.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them. That was his job.

	No shit.

Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHIT! SHIT! Hot! Hot! Hot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tears spring to her eyes. She fans furiously at her mouth. Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her. She takes a swig. There's a nanosecond of relief ... until the tequila hits. Her eyes redden. She spews and gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed chuckles.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. This is some damn good work.

</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that. You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent. We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.

</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

	Oh, they knew. They had to know.

</ERIN>
<ED>

	Show me the document that proves that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't have one.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then they didn't know. And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is. Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and we're the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things? That's just not right.

Erin's giving George a guided tour. As they head down the hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?

She flicks on the lights. Brenda's desk is decorated and as a present on it. Erin's is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one?

<DIRECTION>
(it's obvious)

	God damn. I work so hard. The least they could do ...

George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little. He goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Fuck 'em, babe. Who needs 'em, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her. She leans into him. He kisses her some more.

<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? All we need is each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses back. She's gonna let him take care of her. Some more kisses, heating up. He slides her onto her empty desk.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thing there isn't a present there, huh? That mighta hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>

She laughs a little. He slides his hands up her skirt. She pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, George, it's a party.

She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall and crumples onto the floor. As she curls around Beth, Erin starts to COUGH. Deep, raspy coughs from way down low.

EXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Late, late at night. The plant is silent. The property seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone inside the gates, staring up at the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant. It misses. Not that it would do anything if it hit. He reaches for another, throws it. Then another, and another. He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant. Then, overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.

<DIRECTION>
Erin has no patience for this today.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, see, now that pisses me off. First of all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs. They may not be sophisticated, but they do know how to divide, and two million dollars isn't shit when it's split between them.

Mario and Anna exchange a look. This is getting interesting.

	Erin --

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no stopping her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And second of all -- these people don't dream about being rich. They dream about being able to watch their kids swim in a pool without worrying they'll have to have a hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a client of ours -- or have their spine deteriorate like Stan Bloom. Another client of ours. So before you come back here with another lame-ass offer, I want you to think real hard about what your spine is worth, Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez -- then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred. Anything less than that is a waste of our time.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents and files. She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on the page, and COUGHING while she works. Ed calls to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you. I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D'you get his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course not. Jesus, Ed --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the bottle. She checks her watch: 6:30. The GAS STATION ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the only station in town, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
He gets in his car and drives off. Erin sits down again. Looks down the road in both directions. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint of chrome. She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees: the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin looks around, realizes she's alone. As she looks back at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab. She realizes she's being watched. The driver's door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys. She jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it won't turn over. Panic. The Man in the Dark Glasses has gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around again. Not a soul. She tries the engine again. And again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages. Erin peels out of the gas station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus on the road. She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the train tracks. A train is passing. She has to stop. As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce off her rear view mirror. Truck lights, coming her way. Fuck. She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back at the headlights closing in on her. The train, the headlights, the train, the headlights ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last train car zips by. Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car over the tracks. The truck follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hyundai zips down the road. And behind it, the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks out at the landscape around her. It's black. No other cars on the road. She starts to panic, accelerates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hyundai going faster. The truck still following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin comes up on a stop sign. She runs it. So does the truck. A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST CAUSE SALOON. In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's Mercedes. She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door. She rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

	Someone's following me.

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed gets up and heads toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
<DIRECTION>
(to the counter guy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beer, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of truck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Big. Dark.

	No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just asking. Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Yeah, I'm ... fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed looks at her. She looks terrible. Shaky, tired, drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>

	Jesus, you look like shit. When was the last time you had a decent night's sleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crappy and pink. Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot. Erin's Hyundai follows. Ed stops, gets out.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ed swings by Erin's open car window.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'm getting two rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each rattling a key. They find their adjacent rooms and stop. Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock the door every which way you can. And if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever -- pound on the wall. I'll come right over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She nods a little. Then before she goes into her room:
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should know -- there's very few people in the world who don't piss me off 90 percent of the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're one of 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it. They look at each other. Maybe even considering. But after a long beat, she reaches for her door again. Moment over.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm triple locking my door, so don't even think of trying to take advantage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, goes inside. He watches her close her door behind her before going inside himself.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT

	Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen into a hellhole. You know you can't leave them alone like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't answer. Doesn't move. She notices this.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on? What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>

	About this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me. That's a long time.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard --

</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't leave my job, George.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say. I never had that. Ever. Don't ask me to give it up. I need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More than you need me.

He nods, then stands, to leave.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you didn't like who you were before, Erin, but I did. That's who I fell in love with.

Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already packed up your stuff?

</ERIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Erin is driving, looking weary. Her kids are in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matthew turns on the radio. Erin reaches over and turns it off. Matthew turns it back on. Erin glares at him, turns it off. On/off/on/off. A test of wills. Finally, when Matthew turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob off the stereo and throws it out the window.

You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once? Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing? Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?

</ED>
<ERIN>

	That's a fucking fortune, Ed. And you know I'm the last person on Earth to walk away from a big payday. But you and me didn't get into this to get rich. We did it cause we both have this voice in our heads saying, do the right thing; get these plaintiffs what they deserve -- the right to live and die in some kind of comfort and peace. If 50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta say no.

	What's a demur?

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case. Their lawyers go --

Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall.

<ERIN>

	Hey -- those are my files --

</ERIN>
<THERESA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we had them couriered over. And listen, good work. They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERESA>
<DIRECTION>
Okay, these people are starting to piss her off.

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me -- Theresa, was it? There are no holes in my research.

</ERIN>
<THERESA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No offense. There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERESA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay? I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.

</ERIN>
<THERESA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin. You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.

</THERESA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose number do you need?

</ERIN>

</THERESA>
<ERIN>

	I said, whose number do you need?

Ted's got Chron's disease, and Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and underwent a hysterectomy last fall. Ted grew up in Hinkley. His brother Robbie and his wife May and their five kids Robbie, Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on the plume too. Their number's 454-9445. You want their diseases?

<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She insulted me!

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the fuck should I respect her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed stops in his tracks, furious. He glares at her.

<ED>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY

Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention. Finally, rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses it at the barn. It hits the window and BREAKS IT.

Ted Daniels is on the phone. Rita is next to him.

<TED>

	That may be. But I don't want her coming to the house again. She's kinda stuck-up, and she upsets Annabelle. Now, I hate to say this, but when she left today, Rita asked if we should get a new lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, no -- don't do that. If you don't like Theresa, you don't have to work with her. Me and Ed are still here for you.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This band of PG&E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive of all. Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most senior PG&E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... we would enter into binding arbitration -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be between 50 and 400 million dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.
</DIRECTION>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any preconditions on the settlements?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<CORBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plaintiffs have to agree to it unanimously. And they're barred from ever discussing their settlement with anyone.

	Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I thought you should rest.

	And, what, I'm not serious?

</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Fun?" Jesus, "fun?" I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"

<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
	</DIALOGUE>

</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
By now the entire office is watching. As are the lawyers in the conference room.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>

	Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...

Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.

<ERIN>

	If this piece of shit is supposed to take the place of your respect, you can take it and shove it up your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>

She throws it at him and storms away. The phone hits the glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it. Ed just stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the splintered glass wall.

Erin gets to her car. As she opens the door, the ALARM SOUNDS. She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out. With the siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.

She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark. She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street. A CAR HONKS.

Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again. Holy shit, is right. It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk, blocking his path. When he sees her car, he turns and runs the other way. Erin leaps out and follows him.

<ERIN>

	So why would PG&E offer it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because. They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial. Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

	Hey, that's not so bad. Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime. So in legal terms, ten years is --

	No, I'm serious. You know what Kurt Potter is? He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million. He doesn't work like us, Ed.

<DIRECTION>
And still bigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK. A bunch more forms get thrown onto the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to some folks out there tonight.

</ERIN>

WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up. As she turns to get into her car, she finds herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit. She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, what're you gonna do? You gonna kill me? Dump my body in a ditch somewhere? Or maybe you just wanna inject me with some poison too -- why change tactics at this stage of the game?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta my way, you make me sick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes past him. But he grabs her by the arm. He's a big guy; it's a strong grab. Now she's scared. For a moment, he does nothing. Just looks at her. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DARK_GLASSES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If PG&E made someone destroy a whole lot of documents -- would that matter to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARK_GLASSES>
<DIRECTION>
Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him. She gently pulls her arm away.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ... I guess that depends on what the documents were.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she takes a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DARK_GLASSES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin and Embry are the only patrons. Erin's eating a burger. Embry has a beer. He's talking quietly, not looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse. We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he say why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. And I didn't ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. So yeah, I took a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds. The water in them. They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you were told to destroy those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Destruction of evidence. Pretty big deal. Erin plays it down. Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That I kept instead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Erin stops, mid-bite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents. Erin looks them over, stunned. Embry is standing apart from her, hands shoved deep in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<EMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college. I can't afford to lose my job. I told myself I was being honorable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there's nothing honorable in what I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosalind is at the desk. Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping themselves to coffee. Erin enters, with a big box in her arms and a whole lot of attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ros, where are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ROSALIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the conference --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALIND>
<DIRECTION>
But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can finish. Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her gait. They watch her with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated slew of paper that PG&E is sending them. Ed, Kurt, Theresa, Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin breezes in like sunshine.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin? What are you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring Ed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely forgot your birthday this year. And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight. So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She plunks the box down on the table. Potter opens the top of the box. Looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	635. They all signed. Every single one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering what's up. A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads across Ed's face.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ho - ly - shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed. I got a little something for you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin hands Ed a manila envelope. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Internal PG&E documents, all about the contamination. The one I like best says, and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes, the water's poisonous, but it'd be better for all involved if this matter wasn't discussed with the neighbors. It's to the Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters. Stamped received, March, 1966.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Potter and Theresa reel. Ed shakes his head in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did -- how did you do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what with me not having any brains or legal expertise, I just went on up there and performed sexual favors. 635 blow jobs in five days. Whew, am I ever tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed. The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads down the hall. She presses the elevator button. The doors open. As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing. He stares at her, in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say you were wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. Both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in the elevator. He walks toward her, stops right outside the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
<DIRECTION>
(with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Of course she will. She releases her hand so he won't see her smiling. Ed watches the doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PCH - DAY

One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.

Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH. DISCO music emanates from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Erin's at the wheel. Time has passed -- her hair's a little different. She's singing along with "Funky Town."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a little cluster. Donna's under an umbrella. Pete is slathering on sunscreen. The two girls zip out toward the water. Erin waves. Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her girls boogie board in. Erin comes up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you feeling today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Donna turns, sees her. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a good day. I feel good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin sits down on a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The judge came up with a number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A number for the whole group, or for us?

</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both.

Donna sits down next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>

	He's making them pay the maximum.

Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five million dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five million dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She reels. After a breathless beat:
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know how much money that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light flickering off her girls playing in the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can put them in a good school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any school you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And get someone to help around the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Oh my God.

Donna is overwhelmed. Erin pulls her close.

	Oh, my God.

Boxes everywhere. They just moved in. Everyone is unpacking at his or her desk. Rosalind is manning the new phones.

<ROSALIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Masry & Vititoe, can I -- shoot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSALIND>
<DIRECTION>
She lost them. Her reaction indicates this isn't the first time. The front doors open and Erin enters.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ros. Nice view, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ROSALIND>

He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check. Hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it.

</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Erin does. Looks at it. Her eyes bug out.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two million dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at it, speechless. He goes back to unpacking
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not enough. Well, tough, Erin. Too goddamn bad. Cause this is absolutely, positively where I draw the line.

FADE OUT.
