</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASPING for BREATH continues, more relentless, harder, heavier and into the FRAME we SEE fragments, slowed into special motion, dreamlike, surreal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dirty blonde hair lifts and tumbles;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bubbles POP through the murky water;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand and then its attached arm swims, in trouble, trying to climb;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then floats as if disembodied, momentary;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SWIMMER drifts, then a brief effort twisting, signs of struggle;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A leg pushes off the nothingness, threatened, an impossible fight;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the claustrophobic GASP, a last chocked back BREATH as other sounds begin to bleed in: the CRACKLE of a RADIO, a few VOICES MURMURING and then more clearly --

:SC: INT. FORD FIESTA - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

The cracked windshield of a blue Ford Fiesta. The clouded form of the drowning SWIMMER is replaced by a small plastic day-glo cross that sways as the Fiesta is lifted up on a tow truck hoist. A PARAMEDIC jogs over to the car as

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The Fiesta stops its ascent. The passenger side door opens and the Paramedic reaches in and snares the bopping cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Paramedic carries the plastic symbol over to a middle aged woman who's sitting on a stretcher, wearing a foam neck brace and looking totally relaxed. This minor fender-bender is an ignored sideshow on a quiet commercial street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the woman reclaims her crucifix, a lanky MAN strides by, over-coated against the fall weather. We FOLLOW the MAN as he rounds the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as he walks on, he gazes out at a small Catholic Church ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
St. Ursula's is a modest seminary sitting adjacent to the Church. And just in front, behind a chain link fence, is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An asphalt playground used by the Church's pre-school program. A group of CHILDREN play there in happy confusion, watched by TWO FEMALE DAY-CARE WORKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLAYGROUND - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the day-care workers alternately pushes TWO KIDS on the swings, using one hand. In her other hand, she holds a cigarette. Her clothes are worn, her sneakers frayed. A simple gold cross hangs loosely from her neck. She's got ancient holes in her ear lobes from another, earlier time, but no longer any earrings. This is MAYA LARKIN. The kids she's pushing are singing "Frere Jacques" as they soar up and down on the swings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second day-care worker, more nicely dressed, shoots Maya disapproving glances as she gives her swinging child modest pushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Latino BOY walks up to Maya, both his shoes are untied and his jacket's unzipped. He points to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(with mock severity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She moves away from the swings, puts out the cigarette and stoops down, tying his shoes. After she finishes, Maya watches him run back into the throng. He dashes past the LANKY MAN, standing just ten feet away. A powerful figure, CLAUDE LAREAUX is in his sixties. A stern, heavy expression glances his face. Maya stands back up slowly, looking at him, a more serious expression on her face now. She tosses her cigarette as we:

A non-descript Chrysler New Yorker as it winds its way down a rural road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHRYSLER MOVING - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car's driver is a fleshy man in his forties named JOHN TOWNSEND. He's anxious, a nail-biter, with the worn hands of a worker. Townsend's slightly nerve-wracked, but trying to settle it all inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya touches a fore-finger across her upper lip, warm, she moves forward, covering heat vents with a cupped hand, uncomfortable, then finally flipping off the heat altogether, which makes a final WHOOSHING GASP. She POWERS OPEN the electronic window, a rough hum as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lareaux, in the back seat watching her. Seated next to Lareaux is a dark haired, kind looking man in his 30's, JEREMY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya straightens the cuffs of her shirt sleeves - first the right, then the left. Then she repeats it all. Townsend notes the repetitive movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the RADIO is ON in the B.G.:
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_DJ_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it says here in today's news that science is looking for a lost minute of daylight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_DJ_1>

<RADIO_DJ_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they find that minute...
	</DIALOGUE>

Townsend FLIPS OFF the radio. There is an excruciatingly loud pause as everyone in the car sits quietly. Then Maya turns sideways, leaning towards the backseat, and whispers to Lareaux:

As Maya turns back around in her seat, Lareaux looks up, sees Townsend's dart of worry in the rear view.

:SC: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lareaux, his overcoat open, walks down the dim corridor. We now see he's a priest. He's wearing a black cassock with a waist-high surplice (belt) and a narrow purple stole. He carries a Bible. Townsend, Maya and Jeremy are right beside him. We see Jeremy is also a priest. Townsend is carrying a hard, black leather suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large windows, bordered by huge pillars, circumscribe the never-ending corridors. Thick doors line the walls, each with a tiny observation window, filled in with octagonal wire patterns. The foursome avoids looking directly at any of those windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass other rooms, doors wide open, lined with several beds each separated by worn curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT./EXT. SECOND CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting next to a door on this corridor is the hospital's Chief Resident Psychiatrist, DR. LESLIE ALLEN. She's casual, calm and intelligent. A mature woman in her late 50's, still attractive, at peace with herself. As she sips a cup of peppermint tea, she glances outside, through a window opposite her chair, at a huge old tree, the antithesis of the sterile, prison-like environment inside. She finds ways to remain grounded in this place.

As Lareaux and company approach, Dr. Allen switches her gaze and --

:SC: INT. PATIENT'S ROOM - MORNING

The room has been painted hot pink. The only furniture is a large table, a chair and a bed. A few books sit stacked on the table: Albert Beutel's Cryptology, George Fleck's Shaping Space and Claude Shannon's seminal Mathematical Theory of Communication, among others on advanced math.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slightly round man named HENRY BIRDSON is seated in the single restraining chair, compulsively writing numbers on a yellow legal pad. He wears green hospital pants and T-shirt.

He looks up and smiles at all his visitors; a blinding, angry smile.

Townsend opens the black leather suitcase. Inside: rolls of duct and masking tape, two Bibles, three rosaries, a scapular, bottles of holy water and a gold Chalice, sitting in foam-laden velvet, for the Communion Eucharist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya quickly and expertly locks in Birdson's chair restraints. Arms and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Jeremy pulls out a roll of duct tape, sealing the desk drawer shut. Then, he sets up a portable tape recorder on the table. Secures that as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Birdson restrained, Maya pulls large square-cut pieces of blackout cloth out of the suitcase. She grabs a roll of masking tape, TEARING two pieces of it with her teeth, right off the roll. A SEARING, jarring sound, unexpected every time. Moving to the door, she immediately tapes a square of blackout cloth over the observation window. As the cloth drops, Dr. Allen's face disappears.

Maya TEARS several more pieces of masking tape, continuing to block out each window.

Suddenly an ORDERLY bursts around the corner, sprinting toward her.

Dr. Allen and the orderly are jogging down the hallway. The sound of SCREAMING can be faintly heard in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Allen starts to run, leaving her patient, holding her stethoscope and pocket for anything that might fall out. Her BREATHING is slightly LABORED. Her patient SCREAMS after her:

From the room, a CHORUS of TORMENTED VOICES is heard. A hideous CACOPHONY that builds in intensity with each passing moment, punctuated by sharp explosions of wood and glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sounds like the room is being torn to pieces. Along with everyone in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something heavy hits the door on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the door BURSTS open. The screaming instantly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lareaux's at the door, pushing past the two orderlies and as he collapses against a wall, Dr. Allen sees he's shaking, completely devastated. Father Jeremy hurries after him, concerned.

<FATHER_JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, are you alright? Can you get up?

</FATHER_JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Laura Allen walks slowly over to the door. And bracing herself, she leans forward and stares inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is immaculate. Nothing's damaged, not a stick of furniture is out of place. Townsend and Maya slowly back out, careful not to look at Birdson who sits nonchalantly still tied to his chair...
</DIRECTION>
<BIRDSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right here, you know.

Birdson turns and stares at Dr. Allen with a chilling look of triumph.

Peter's in his early 30's, fit, handsome, well-dressed, even seductive. The ubiquitous success story, cynical, edgy and focused, he's all or nothing.

piece of notebook paper covered with a nonsensical collection of vowels and consonants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TILT UP to see Maya, who tosses the sheet onto a pile of rejects. She takes a sip of coffee. Stale. Maya reacts. Finishes a cigarette. Puts it out in a plain glass ashtray. Lying next to her pack of cigarettes, a vintage Zippo, inscribed, "peace and fuck you."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Maya's left is Birdson's legal pad. On it he has written rows of numbers in neat, precise handwriting. Maya has drawn red lines at regular intervals, showing a repeating pattern of 11 numbers in a row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., her used, always, "ON," 24" TV is airing a daytime talk show. Guy describes his girlfriend's affair AD LIB. Maya reacts to the insanity of the show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the wall above Maya's table that serves as her desk, is a varied collection of crayoned drawings from the children in her day-care class, a postcard from Louisiana depicting New Orleans, a postcard-sized copy of Modigliani portrait of a woman, and an old photograph of Maya and her sister.

The page she just discarded "IF R EQUALS ONE" at the top and letters of the alphabet matched up with a series of numbers. Birdson's cryptology book is visible to Maya's right, as she works off her newest piece of paper, labeled "IF S EQUALS ONE." Maya moves to her mini fridge. Looks inside. Pulls out a soda. Pops the tab. Spray startles her a moment. Wipes off her fingers. SLAMS the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comparing numbers and letters with a second piece of paper, Maya notes that the first number, 24, gives her the letter "P." The next number, 13, produces an "E." She writes those down. Flicks a long ash into a half-full ashtray. Gulps air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya continues the coded procedure. The next three numbers equal a "T," an "E" and an "R." Finally spelling "Peter."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya gets up. Stretches. Ashtray getting full. Taps out a single cigarette from her shirt pocket. Lights it. EXHALES deeply. Excited and scared at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya checks her newest numbers, adding the letter "K." Tamps out her cigarette into an ashtray with earlier cigarette debris. Small stacks of used up paper. Maya stares at her results, exhausted.

	As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for having me, Sally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case. You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers. I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the less mystifying. Good and evil are only illusions. There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E." That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(a bit mesmerized)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There weren't any voices.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As if there's another cause for little voices? No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean by that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying he's legally sane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one. Not even God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(steps ahead of her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. If you believe in God. As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders. He created the voices after the fact. In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.

A Range Rover double parks in front of an immense Catholic Church. Peter gets out.

Across the street, a group of Orthodox Jews walk by. On the steps of the church is an exotic woman, stylish in a yellow Prada dress with a matching yellow nylon zip jacket. CLAIRE VAN OWEN hugs the collar to her neck against a sudden winter guest. She's a magazine stylist and Peter's girlfriend. As Peter meets Claire on the street, he grabs hold of her, relaxed. He kisses her deeply. Claire still reacts, though it's been a year.

Peter and Claire walk down the center aisle, dwarfed by the vast vaulted ceiling and rosette stations of the cross. At the Travertine and Terrazzo altar, there's a solemn atmosphere. Choir practice is just about to end and the SINGERS are CHANTING A-CAPELLA in Latin.
</DIRECTION>

Standing before them, keeping time and tone, is FATHER JAMES MCKENZIE, a good-natured priest in his late fifties. He sees Peter and Claire and lets the choir practice wind down. Singers begin to collect their music as Father James moves toward his visitors, happy to see them, as always. He gives Peter a strong hug.

A JET ROARS overhead, DEAFENING momentary noise. Father Frank looks up a moment, then:
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (comforting tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before. Satan is not what you think he is. Satan is not some creature.

<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't there. Give me time to get some proof.

</MAYA>
<FATHER_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Maya. I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.

<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?

<FATHER_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.

Anxious, Maya rubs her cross between a thumb and forefinger, distractedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEMINARY STAIRWELL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya crosses through the dim hallway and heads up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SEMINARY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright, clean bathroom with new fixtures and fluorescent lights. Maya comes in, trying to contain her frustration. Turns the water on. She watches the water a moment. Then puts her hands in. Cool on her wrists. Splashes her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(despairing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid man. I can't do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, she hears something. It's faint, but unmistakable - the sound of SCRAPING METAL ON METAL. Then it stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM ABOVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya faces all six stalls. She walks to the first one, pushes open the door. It's empty. She repeats this at the second stall, the thirds, the fourth, the fifth. All are vacant. Now the last one. She pauses just a second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights HUM. She pushes it open. It's empty. Disturbed, she turns back to the sink and as she looks down, the water flows instantly backwards, disappearing up into the faucet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back again, watching the room change from pristine to rotting decay. The stalls behind her have changed. The doors are closed again. They're battered, chipped, scarred. Rusty water flows from underneath. She whirls around. On the stall directly behind her, the letters "X" "E" and "S" have been scratched into the metal in loose, flowing script. At the same time, the lights go dim. The HUM is uneven, more menacing. Alarmed, Maya closes her eyes, then opens them. The vision remains. Her breathing gets lighter, faster. Fingers appear on the top of the stall door behind her. The door is pulled open. A man in inside, wearing hospital clothes. It's Henry Birdson. His eyes bore into hers. He's got a knife in his right hand. Petrified, she stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
He leers and nods, "Yes I am." He steps toward her. Every instinct in her body screams at her to run. But she stays put. And we HEAR A CHOKED BACK BREATH and Birdson slowly extends his knife, just inches from her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer to her face. Then closer still. Until the tip of the blade is slowly creeping toward Maya's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the tip of the blade, literally millimeters from her pupil. Closing painfully slow. Maya braces herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the tip of the knife now only a hair away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Birdson. He smiles. And THRUSTS. She suddenly reaches up and grabs for the blade. The lights "flare" horrifyingly bright for a split second. We hear a surreal distortion of Maya's voice crying out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And "Birdson" vanishes. Maya's looking at a pristine bathroom, its unmarked stall doors pulled tight. Victorious but drained, she slumps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LAREAUX'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside Father Lareaux's Spartan room at the seminary, Lareaux lies in bed, his face turned towards the wall. He's MUMBLING. Maya has pulled herself together and sits by the bed with Father Jeremy and an irritated Father Frank. In the b.g., John Townsend is urgently riffling the books and papers on Lareaux's desk. Most of which we SEE are about demonic possession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unknown to anyone, Townsend slides two of the books under his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Maya doesn't want to hear that. She leans closer. The full wound of her childhood pressed back into her eyes.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, it's me, Maya. Tu m'entends?

Lareaux rolls over and looks at her. The change in his appearance is shocking. His eyes are red-rimmed and his expression is unfocused.

Maya slowly backs away.

<FATHER_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.

</FATHER_FRANK>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will. He has great faith.

</MAYA>
<FATHER_FRANK>

Maya moves over to a silent John Townsend.

<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John. I've got to head back to the city.

A list of names, all doctors. Some have bene crossed off. And as we PULL BACK, we see Maya's on the phone on a Bedford main drag and, as she DIALS, she pivots in the booth, anxious thought process, a pencil being lobbed between two fingers. Suddenly, a VOICE over the phone.

Maya crosses off another doctor's name from her list. DROPS in two more quarters, as several sit stacked by the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya glances around. As she checks her list, TAPPING out another number, she takes a deep BREATH as she sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN walking his dog. The dog suddenly stops, squats and takes a greasy shit right on the sidewalk. Maya can't believe it, wants to say something but the line picks up:

It's dark, except for refracted light from the building opposite. Peter FLIPS on the interior lights and we can see lots of money has been spent here; the interior's warm and tasteful. It's eclectic, evolved. Works of art pepper the surroundings. A small, luminous aquarium sits by the entry wall.

Peter heads into the open kitchen. The flood lights on the outside cast strange, distorted shadows of people moving. Peter reaches down behind the refrigerator and fishes out a pack of cigarettes. He turns on the vent over the stove and lights up, blowing the smoke directly up into the vent, tapping the ashes directly down the sink drain. Unseen by Peter, a cigarette ash drops and lands on the stove.

Peter reappears a moment later, holding a bottle of beer. Takes off his jacket, laying it on top of the sofa. He moves over to the CD player where he flips on some contemporary music. Then he takes a long swallow of beer and sits back down into the sofa.

Peter takes the remote to the CD, turns up the volume.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights on the equalizer. They go from the middle range of green and yellow up to the orange and occasionally red, indicating the volume is pushing "complain."

In response, Mrs. Levotsky BANGS on the wall a little harder.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETER'S LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter, all concentration, is bent over a magnifying glass, using two tiny precision hooks to wrap thread onto the lure. He's at a table in the corner of the living room. A colorful collection of finished lures are displayed on his work area, below a watercolor of a man fly-fishing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter gets frustrated as he repeatedly tries to hook a thread and misses. In the b.g., a leather framed photo of Peter with his parents at an exquisite lake. Peter pushes himself back from the table. Takes a beat. Walks over and picks up the tape Maya gave him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He studies it for a second. Then he naps off the CD player, puts the tape on the cassette deck and hits "play." There's no sound. He turns the volume way up. There's a HUM, but nothing else. Annoyed, Peter hits "forward," then "play." Still nothing. He pushes the volume to the top.

Peter bends down to snap off the tape, failing to notice that the lights on the equalizer are PUSHING HIGH into the red on all channels. He turns off the tape and puts on a Sonny Rollins CD. The music begins at an EAR-PIERCING volume. Peter scrambles to turn it down, then flops back onto the sofa.

Peter looks up and sees the shocked Guard staring at Viznick's bare back. It's covered by an enormous tattoo depicting Christ hanging upside down from the bottom of a cross, pinned there by a nail through his feet. His dangling arms end in stumps. His severed hands are still nailed to the crossbar. The effect is horrific yet mesmerizing. As Peter watches, Viznick puts on a shirt, covering the tattoo, and then sits with his back to Peter.

Peter moves into the bathroom. Claire's sitting in front of a mirror. Her hair's up in a smooth twist, and all she's got on is a bathrobe. We note a photograph of Peter's mother sporting a similar hair style on the dresser.

A glittering Italianate chandelier. As we look down we SEE: Men in black tie and women in high fashion chic form a mosaic of money and power beneath the chandelier's blazing lights. A lavish publisher's party is underway in the hotel's ballroom. In one corner, a CROWD hovers around Peter and Claire, the quintessential perfect couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's in a dramatic skintight dress. He looks great in the latest tux. Adrenaline BUZZ of admiration has soothed Peter, but he's still distracted. Claire, however, is her outgoing self. William in a rented tux and Susan, in a modest gown, hang on the edge of the golden crowd. A JADED YOUNG MAN is leading the conversation.

He points it at Peter's face. Peter is in shock. Everything around him seems to blur, except the gun floating a few feet away. But Townsend hesitates, obviously conflicted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly, the woman to Peter's left SCREAMS. The waiter's tray goes flying. With astonishing speed, William flings himself onto Townsend. They both go down. A SHOT RINGS OUT. Pandemonium. Screams & shouting. Peter sees that William has Townsend in a brutal headlock. Townsend looks panicked, helpless. Peter is pulled back, as the two men disappear beneath a swarm of other bodies.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An angry Peter walks to his Range Rover. The wind is up and it has started to rain. Peter's under-dressed, hunching his shoulders against the elements. He's parked a distance from the Seminary. As he begins a slow jog to his car, the rain begins to come down a bit harder. Suddenly, Peter slips on the wet pavement and falls, scraping his hand. A moment, while he gets his bearings and then he picks himself up, the rain now shooting down the side of his face.

An anxious Maya sits at her desk. Suddenly, there's a hard knock on the door and Father Frank enters. Maya looks up, unprepared.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had it. Townsend's dead. The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.

:SC: INT. FATHER LAREAUX'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Lareaux sleeps quietly, quasi fetal. Maya moves to the room soundlessly. A renewed sadness stabs her at the sight of Lareaux. She studies him a moment, then cups his face in her hands. Slight disturbance in Lareaux's body, like a child's startle reaction. Maya lets go and leaves as quietly as she came.

Upscale. Claire and Peter at lunch. Peter is clearly agitated. His clothes are still wet and pretty wrinkled. Claire looks at him with tenderness.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you. You look a mess. Why don't you go home and clean up before you go back to work.

Claire kisses Peter, brief but deep, as she gulps in a short gust of air.

Maya is sitting on an iron bench outside the playground. A shoulder bag with some of her belongings lays beside her. She stands, picks up her sack and walks across the street to a small diner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's warm, crowded and NOISY. WAITRESSES banter with longtime customers about the ups and downs of everyday life. Maya enters in a state of complete distress. She sits at the counter next to a MOTHER and her LITTLE GIRL. Their drinks and sandwiches are spread out everywhere. The little girl cusp her hand around a tall glass of milk. She wears black patent shoes, a red jacket, hood attached. Maya bows her head and covers her eyes. She's losing it...
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this anymore.

</LITTLE_GIRL>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Gina, that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Maya sees the little girl wants an answer. Moved, she bends close and whispers in her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have someone who takes care of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls back. The little girl looks up at Maya reprovingly.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cruelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's dead. Jesus is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
And then she smiles at Maya, a wicked smile. Maya looks at the little girl, and then at her mother. The mother's eyes are sparkling with malice. The room begins to warp and distort. And we hear a choked back breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified, Maya quickly turns in her chair and faces away from the vision, praying silently with eyes closed. After a moment, she opens her eyes. The room looks normal again. In the reflection of the mirror across the counter she sees that the two seats next to her are empty, the utensils untouched. Sighing with relief, she turns back. But the little girl and her mother are still there. The mother's face suddenly looks elongated, her eyes move too close together and her nose disappears. A frightening distortion, but momentary. And the little girl's smile widens with spite.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so weak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
With a loud, frightened cry, Maya sweeps her arms out, knocking all the nearby glasses, utensils and dishes to the floor with a tremendous crash. Milk bleeds over the counter. All eyes turn to her. Distraught, Maya sees the little girl and the mother are gone. She grabs her bag and runs out the diner.

:SC: INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's quiet, shadowy. The aquarium has begun a slow leak and a small puddle of water has pooled beneath it. Peter enters. He notices the water on the floor. He goes into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ledge of the building across the way can be seen from Peter's window. A WOMAN is moving near the ledge, setting out a grouping of potted geraniums. From downstairs, a shaft of light is visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter changes his clothes Then, he feels the scrape on his hand. Looks at it. As he moves to the bathroom. Washes his hand and as he does so, he checks his reflection in the mirror. Stares at himself a moment, then sticks out his tongue. Checks it. And then dries his hand, moving back to the bedroom, carrying his towel with him. Peter glances at his bed a moment. Half-amused, he leans over and checks behind the picture hanging above the headboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he bends down, checking under the bed. Again, nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he moves to a bedroom closet, pulling down a black and gray speckled file box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, a series of newspaper clippings, graphic photos. Yellowed with age, on of which falls on the bed, titled, "Unsolved Brutal Murders." Peter riffles past the clippings to the coroner's report.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speed reads it, until he gets to his parents' blood types: "Andrea Kelson - A negative." Jack Kelson - O positive." Peter stares at the information. Confused by what it's supposed to mean. Then, he pulls on a turtleneck sweater, ready to go back out.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous.

Peter exits the bedroom and steps back towards the living room, carrying the towel.

<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>

Peter stands in the middle of the sidewalk as the wind violently whips at his jacket. He gazes upward to the mute, gray sky. Finally he lowers his eyes. He sees something that angers him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sprawling Catholic church stands before him. Peter regards it with wrath. He pushes open the door and tries to enter, but a group of LITHUANIAN parishioners pushes past him, blocking his way. A priest calls a farewell.
</DIRECTION>
<LITHUANIAN_PRIEST>

:SC: INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

It's dark, forbidding. The priest exits around a corner. Peter looks at the vast and spacious altar. Above it is an enormous wooden crucifix. Peter moves down the aisle toward the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sorrowful face of the Christ figure looks down on Peter with pity. The body hangs, gaunt, wracked with pain. The wrists pierced by nails, the feet cruelly hammered together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter stops at the first pew. He looks up at the crucifix. Defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, do something. Show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He waits. For a split-second, there's a pristine silence. Then the sound of the wind rises in the church. With that, the right wrist SHATTERS with a noise like a rifle shot. Freed from one of its supports, the heavy wooden Christ SLAMS FORWARD at an awkward angle. The other wrist SNAPS IN TWO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a second, the Christ figure trembles. Then, with a sickening sound, the entire wooden body falls forward, swings sideways and PLUMMETS down. Peter doesn't want to look. The figure is now hanging upside down, held only by the brace at its feet. Above it, each hand remains pinned to the cross. It's an EXACT COPY of Viznick's tattoo.

Peter staggers outside, dodging two DOGS fighting, a vicious NOISY battle on the Rectory lawn. And in the b.g., a homeless man takes a piss into a rivulet of white liquid. Peter walks in a daze, pulling his car keys from his pocket.

<DIRECTION>
Peter pulls up in his Range Rover across the street from the playground. He gets out of his car and crosses the street. As Peter walks closer, he sees Maya. She's sitting on a swing, looking off into space, rocking ever-so-slightly back and forth, a pile of smoked, crushed cigarettes and her shoulder bag at her feet.

Standing beside Maya is an agitated DAY-CARE WORKER. Their conversation is FAINTLY AUDIBLE. Across the yard, a SECOND DAY-CARE WORKER is shepherding the last of the kids back inside the center. The children are carefree and rambunctious, unaware of the adult drama taking place around them.

The Latino Boy and one of his friends LAUGH and break free from the line heading back to the school. They circle back toward Maya and swoop by her, waving exuberantly, then return to the line and go into the school. The day-care worker follows them as:

Peter walks through the gate. He walks fast toward Maya, who sees him coming, from a distance. Maya continues rocking ever so gently on her swing. Peter puts out his hands and stops it. Stares at her, scared.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn't born of incest.

Peter tries the light switch. It doesn't work. He walks around the room - and is spooked by a glimpse of movement.

It's his own reflection in a mirror. He sees a closet door and opens it. Inside, it's totally dark. He pulls a hanging cord. A light goes on revealing a small pantry filled with canned goods, foodstuff.

An antique oak bed dominates the room, with two suitcases lying on top. The place is a mess - clothes strewn everywhere. There's a roll-top desk in the corner with some books and papers on it. One of Townsend's jackets is draped on the desk chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the opposite wall is a door that's open just a crack. The interior of a bathroom is visible on the other side. The door has a smoky, opaque window built into its top half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya starts sifting through the papers on the desk. She can hear Peter's footsteps moving slowly above her. And the sound of doors opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the desk drawers. The first one is stuffed with bills. The second has checkbooks, bank statements. The third is stuck shut.
</DIRECTION>

Maya kneels down to get better leverage. From this perspective, we can see the open door to the dark hallway behind her...She pulls and pulls again. As the drawer pops open, a shadow falls across her. She WHIRLS.

Henry Birdson is standing in the corner, same green regulation drawstring pants and matching T-shirt. He has a fish-gutting knife in his hand. With an evil smile, he calmly steps forward, imitating the gesture Maya saw in the restroom at the seminary. He raises his knife, holding it out in front of her. Maya stands still. She wants to run more than anything in life, but she doesn't. Instead, she reaches out one hand and touches the knife ever so gently with the tips of her fingers. Fro a second, neither one moves. Maya's face registers great fear. Birdson slides the knife back. Maya sees blood on her hands coming from a cut on her fingers. She trembles, but doesn't run. Maya uses the humility and calm of an experienced exorcist.

Maya throws herself back into the bedroom, SLAMMING the door shut behind her as Birdson's body smashes into it. Maya sees Birdson's shadowy form trying to break the glass with an animal-like fury. Scrambling against his mounting pressure, Maya tries but fails to get the lock to close. The door SHUDDERS, as Birdson pummels it with his body. Birdson CRACKS the glass. A spiderweb of shards rips through the window.

Over her shoulder, we see the door behind her slightly open. She turns and realizes this, takes two steps toward that door and then freezes. Maya's in the center of the room, equidistant from all the doors. She looks back at the door to the bathroom. No shadows block the light at its base. Ever so slowly, keeping her eyes on the bathroom door, she reaches over, unlocks and then pulls open the door to the hall. It swings open silently. She strains, listening as hard as she can. But the only sound she can hear is her own shallow breathing. She says a silent prayer. Then steps gingerly toward the door to the hallway. As she takes a second step:

With Peter and Maya in the foreground, we see, although they don't, that Birdson sits up, his eyes open, staring at a point above Maya and Peter. A horrible rictus smile moves across his face. Birdson's eyes roll back into his head until only white remains. Then he begins to jerk uncontrollably, his face contorting into one frightening expression after the next. Peter grabs the fish knife, moving in front of Maya.

Birdson's limbs begin to torque out of control. He convulses on the floor then suddenly sits up closer to camera. His eyes roll back down into a normal position. His face becomes calm.

Suddenly, the chandelier above them flickers, the globes EXPLODING and showering them with shards of glass. Birdson's entire body begins to vibrate, urine seeping out from beneath him. Then, horrifyingly, a horn like protusion begins to push out from the upper edge of Birdson's head, growing, straining...until finally the horn BURSTS through blowing his head apart. Birdson falls back onto the floor. And as Birdson finally dies, Peter looks at the corpse, then drops heavily onto an arm of a chair. Drained, Maya sits next to him.

A lamp flies off with it. Then he stands and sweeps his arm across the top of his bureau, knocking off pictures, moments, a jewelry box. Turning, he flips over a chair and kicks it viciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing hard, he slumps back on the bed. Across the room he sees a picture of Claire has slipped partially behind the bureau. Its glass has shattered and only half her face is visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter immediately picks it up. Stares down at this smiling girlfriend. He lays it carefully back on the bureau, trying to regain some control. He breathes deep, then begins gathering everything back on to the bed. He looks at the set of keys. Picks them up. Compares them with his own set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to think, he stares out his bedroom window at the building ledge across the way. He SEES the potted geraniums, now arranged, a simple red flourish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a light snaps on in the apartment below and as he looks down, noticing it, his eyes shift, a momentary realization and he looks back down at the keys and leaves his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter gets on. He looks at the unknown keys again. Then pushes the button for the fourth floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. APT. 4-A - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter knocks softly on the door. Then more loudly. No response. He tries on of the new keys, slowly giving it a turn. It works. He tries the lower lock. The click of this key is audible as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. APT. 4-A
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings open to a dark apartment. Peter stands warily at the door, then flips on the lights. Nothing there. No furniture. No occupance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter steps in and closes the door. He looks around at the emptiness. A cockroach scurries across the floor in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks through the living room and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a small table and lamp have been left in the corner. Peter switches on the lamp. He notices the ceiling's been dropped. A grid of white tile panels, held by a lightweight metal frame. He stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very slowly he raises the broom upward and pokes on of the panels. It moves easily. He pushes harder and manages to angle the panel, sliding it back, so that some of the original ceiling is visible. He sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lurid splash of color, a tiny fragment of white line, and part of a strange design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter stares hard at it. He grabs the small table from the corner and drags it to the center of the room. Standing on it, he can now easily reach the tiles with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SMASHES the panels loose, KNOCKING THEM OUT and dropping them on the floor. Two, three, four more tiles. Then five.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME JUMP CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor below him is littered with ceiling tiles. Peter looks up at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CEILING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous PENTACLE. Nine feet wide. It sprawls across the ceiling. Runic symbols crest its edges. For a moment, Peter's mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door of Apt. 4-A is thrown open. Peter takes off, leaving the door ajar behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door is thrown open. Peter steps in to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maya, standing, slightly tense, talking to somebody. The other VOICE is obscured by the sound of a garbage truck moving down the street. And as Peter moves farther inside, past the door, he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire, sitting on the overstuffed chair.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are! My God, darling, I've been so worried. Are you alright?

</CLAIRE>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Peter holds out the keys to Claire, ignoring Maya.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. What are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found them in your file box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be a spare set.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PETER>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Claire)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were hiding them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Claire gets up, moving to Peter, and reaches to embrace him. He lets it happen, but doesn't reciprocate.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(moving across the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found the pentacle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Maya's eyes widen with alarm. She turns quickly toward Claire who's watching them. And as Peter follows Maya's stare, in one slow move, Claire pulls a Beretta from a drawer in the aquarium table. She points the gun directly at Maya.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been stalking you, Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're going to kill her? Put the gun down Claire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Claire ignores him, but before she can make her move, Peter has grabbed her wrist, twisting her back into the living room, trying to pull the gun out of her hand. Claire wrests free of Peter.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still going to be together.

</CLAIRE>
<CLAIRE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing you can do about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Maya)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've fucking had it with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
She lunges at Maya, one powerful move, but as she does, Maya moves out of the way. And as Maya spins around, Claire goes for her again, but she trips on the wet floor, losing her balance. As Peter grabs to catch her, she crashes horribly through the glass shelves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he walks to Claire and pulls the gun from her lifeless hand. Maya and Peter stare at each other in shock for a moment. Then Maya's pager sounds. She checks the number and goes to the phone and dials. As she does, Peter pulls a blanket off the sofa and covers Claire's body.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, it's me. What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She listens, and her expression changes to one of relief. She hangs up the phone and turns to Peter.

As the sunlight prisms on dew-covered grass, Peter and Maya pull into the seminary parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FATHER LAREAUX'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small crowd of priests, including Father Frank, is in the room. Several stand next to the bed, blocking a clear view of Father Lareaux. Soft CLASSICAL MUSIC plays. The mood is upbeat. As the door opens, Father Frank sees Maya lead Peter in by the arm like a puppet or a lost soul.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(vindictively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're here. There's something you need to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
With only a cursory glance at Peter, he leads Maya to the bed. The other priests move away. Father Lareaux is sitting up against his pillows. He looks good, rosy cheeked - almost back to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
(happy to see her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miette...

Maya throws her arms around his neck, smiling for the first time in a long time.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father! Thank God you're better! I really need your help. We've only got a few more hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<LAREAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean "don't worry?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
(being careful not to wound her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion. God would never allow anything like that to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Maya is floored. Father Frank looks at her scornfully.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you this was myth all along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FRANK>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean it's over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Lareaux nods a "yes" at Peter, as Maya sits on the old priest's bed. Peter stands beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...we won?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
(sweet smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We won, that's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Maya plays with her cross, distractedly, rocking it back and forth between her fingers. Lareaux re-fluffs his pillows, looking away from Maya, moving slightly, making himself more comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<LAREAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um hm. That's right, Maya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly, swallowing back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to rest, Miette? You must be exhausted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Maya picks up a scapular from the dresser and moves in closer to Lareaux.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(insistent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess Satan lost. Satan is the weak one.

<LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
(breath coming in shorter bursts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miette, come here and relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Maya is crowding Lareaux now, the scapular thrust almost directly in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(repeating, monotone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can relax, because Satan the coward, trembles before Christ, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Father Frank moves over to Maya with another Priest. Sees Lareaux is having trouble breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. That's enough for now. He's just recovering. Take it easy, Maya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
But Maya resists their tugging arms, leaning closer to Lareaux.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But doesn't he tremble, Father? Doesn't he cower, like a frightened jackal? Satan, the half-wit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYA>

Maya continues, taunting, her cross dangling over Lareaux.

Maya thrusts the scapular onto Father Lareaux's forehead. He recoils violently, as though burned.

A nervous Father Frank is supervising the Jesuits as they empty Lareaux's room of its extraneous contents. He avoids looking at Maya. Father Lareaux sits calmly in a chair at the center of the room. None of the Jesuits meet his eye. One Priest tapes the curtains closed over the window. A lamp provides the only light.

Maya looks at him, then clasps his hand briefly. She breaks off and walks over to Father Frank.

Father Thomas, a tall Jesuit in his forties, strides down the hall. He's dressed in a long black cassock, with surplice and purple stole. He's resolute. Two other Jesuits, Father Malcolm and Father Jeremy, follow him.

The priests enter and begin to prep the room. Father Malcolm goes to the closet and takes out the briefcase we saw at Birdson's exorcism. He opens it and takes out a bible, a cross a vial of Holy Water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Father Thomas don his cassock and scapular in the partitioned dressing area of Father Lareaux's room. Maya enters. Peter, from the doorway, sees her lock eyes with Lareaux. Finally, she turns away. Lareaux's smile widens. Father Thomas steps out from Behind the partition.

<FATHER_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tie him to the chair.

</FATHER_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Father Thomas makes the Sign of the Cross. Then, he places the tip of his stole on Lareaux's neck, and his right hand on Lareaux's head. Lareaux flinches. Father Thomas places relics of the Saints on Lareaux's chest. He writhes as if in pain. Father Thomas sprinkles Lareaux with Holy Water. Lareaux reacts as though it were burning oil. Finally, Father Thomas kneels, beginning the Litanies of the Saints, in Latin.
</DIRECTION>

The last thing Peter sees as the door closes is Maya. Serious, tight, professional and outside the door, Father Frank is already mouthing his rosary:

Father Frank leads the other Jesuits down the hall. Within seconds, Peter's alone. He looks at the door. Then he slowly moves closer to it, until he's a foot away. He tries to listen. Nothing. He leans even closer.

Suddenly a body slams into the wall which starts to ripple as if a subterranean shape were moving through it. The body appears to be climbing straight up the wall.

There's an explosion of NOISE, shrieking and shouting, the sounds of furniture being violently overturned. Peter is mesmerized and scared. Hateful VOICES SWELL UP.

The room is not destroyed. The room is FREEZING COLD, breath is visible. Lareaux is tied to the chair. Father Thomas is standing over him, with a crucifix in hand, the Eucharist on Lareaux's head. Maya and the younger Priests are kneeling just behind Father Thomas, overwhelmed.

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
A TORRENT OF PROFANITY drowns him out. A thousand voices, young and old, crying, cursing, filling the air with hatred and spite. Amidst this hurricane of sound, the lights begin to flicker at ultra-high speed, creating a strobe effect. The window bursts open, flooding the room with light. Father Jeremy races over and struggles to close it, but cannot. Maya is revealed praying, eyes open. Peter and Father Malcolm are crouched near the door. A terrified Father Thomas is bravely standing, holding his crucifix in front of himself, facing Lareaux. Or where Lareaux was. The chair is empty Amid the deafening noise, Peter sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lareaux rise up behind Maya and encircle her throat with his hands as the HELLISH VOICES reach a crescendo. Lareaux begins to sing softly:
</DIRECTION>
<LAREAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rock-a-bye baby, on a tree top...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAREAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Peter leaps to pull Lareaux off her, but the aging priest surprised Peter by grabbing him and hold him at bay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Peter struggles, Lareaux's expression shifts. His confidence vanishes and pain distorts his features. Lareaux falls to the floor in agony. Maya and Peter bend down to help him, but the noise makes it impossible for them to hear one another. Maya pulls open Lareaux's collar to try to get him more air and in that instant, the VOICES STOP. The lights POP on. Maya leans close to Lareaux, who's dying on the floor, MUMBLING incoherently. And on Lareaux's forehead, we see incisions resembling strange, unknown letters. Like they've been cut from within. The incisions are repeated on the backs of Lareaux's hands. The room is so cold, steam pops off the breath. Father Thomas moves fast, beginning the last rites in Latin. He makes the sign of the Cross on Lareaux's forehead, then:

	Wait a minute. The message. He used French, he knew he couldn't say it directly. The arc "sank" or "cinq" c-i n-q. It's French for five. The sun "set" or pronounced like "sept". The French word for seven. The arc "sank" again.

Stunned, Peter lets the gun lower a moment and then, as he turns back to Maya, he's too late.

James has moved behind Maya, holding a long-bladed knife at her throat. James anchors it at her neck, forming a shimmering upside down Cross, Runic symbols carved into the Sterling handle.

Stunned, Peter gulps a mouthful of air, lifts his gun and shoots William in the eye. Immediate. The bullet powers through William, lodging in Mrs. Quintana. She COUGHS up a GURGLING choke, eyes wide. And as she dies gripping her neck, she doubles over the back of a wooden pew.

<DIRECTION>
The crowd reacts. Maya grabs hold of Peter edging him back toward the vestry and out of the church. As the Congregation starts to press forward, Peter swings the gun back up and out toward them. It glistens off the Chalices. They stop, wary and as Maya and Peter finally turn their backs on the crowd, they take off past the sacred Eurcharistic relics.

Maya holds the Beretta. The strain etched on her face, her hands shake, her eyes well up. Peter waits, watching her. She's unsure. We HEAR a choked back breath. Gasping, lungs looking for air. The struggle for life.

The car clock seems frozen on 4:54. Finally, it turns over and...
