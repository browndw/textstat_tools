FADE IN:

On credit sequence...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stretched out. Long, alabaster white. Beautiful. A WASH CLOTH enters frame. Starts washing the arm with long, tender strokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TUMBLE OF HAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
thick and auburn. Being gently washed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINGERNAILS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
being clipped with a shiny nail clipper. Short. Uniform. Tidy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EYEBROWS
</DIRECTION>

brown with a touch of gold. A BRUSH comes into view. Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again. Against. Then back again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANTY-HOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulled gingerly off a long leg. Folded neatly. The wash cloth begins between the toes. Warm, soapy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now dry. The HAND appears with a comb. Pulls down through the thick tresses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL GLOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from it. Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag. In the bag we see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail clippings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goes back to combing. Comes across a knot and yanks the comb through. The HEAD rolls over to us. Her face is bruised, her eyes blank. She is lying on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead.

<DIRECTION>
End of credit sequence.

INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY
</DIRECTION>

The loud THRUM of a bush plane. We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy window. Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Just look at all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>

PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side by side. Hap's at the window. Greying moustache, a little pudgy, wearing a brown suit. Holding a folded over Seattle Times.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>

Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need to look at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will Dormer. Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit. Snakeskin cowboy boots. There's both a magnetism and a distance to him. An intense mixture. Hap glances at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks up. We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his Adam's apple. There's tension between him and Hap, just below the surface. He taps the file.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell that to her, partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE FILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS. Of the dead girl. Her eyes puffed up from bruises. The whites bloody. Contusions along her breasts and shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective?

	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Will nods. The plane lurches. The file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter. The pilot catches a glimpse of them. Looks at Will.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small yellow plane veers left. Clears a mountain top and gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline. The green of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock of the beaches. Enormous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska. Halibut Fishing Capital of the World!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small, corrugated building. The "airport." Nothing else for miles around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it. Brakes SCREECHING. A YOUNG WOMAN hops out. About 23. Petite with short, brown hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peers up at the sky. Brightens at the sight of the BUSH PLANE coming in for landing. Smooths down her down vest. Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible. Nervous. Excited.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom. Just made detective three weeks ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ANGSTROM>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie, used to not being taken seriously. Turns back to THE ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip. Coming to a stop. She hurries over as the door swings open and...
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
She leads them away from the plane. Takes Will's briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>

</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where Ronald Langley cut you in the basement of his father's house on 325 Leland, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>

Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>

</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force." Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years. They're turning it into a witch hunt. Something on the news about it practically every night.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking. The room is sparse and creaky. Bed dips in the middle. He hangs a jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase. Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON 45.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lays it on the bedside table. Takes out a shoulder holster. A back holster. A handful of shells. Lays them on the table. Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM. Checks the magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a KNOCK on the adjoining door.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will SLAPS the magazine back.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Hap opens the door. A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you have the same decor as my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the big window. It overlooks the harbor. Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance. One lone TUGBOAT in the harbor towing a freighter.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same view, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been watching that tugboat for the last half hour. So small, pulling all that weight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to talk, Will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will reaches into his suitcase. Pulls out a shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want to talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will throws him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's that, a week? Two weeks?...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(heads over to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to figure out a plan of action now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know my plan of action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To do nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. Five hours. Asking all kinds of questions...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's asking everybody questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's zeroing in on me. On us. Everyone's talking about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's just rattling your cage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I gotta tell you. With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will goes back to his suitcase. Hap follows. A thin film of sweat on his upper lip.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
<DIRECTION>
(lowers voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. We've tampered with evidence. We've pushed witnesses. We've planted shit. And they're sniffing around like dogs. Especially on the Dobbs case...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will flares up. Struck a nerve. Turns to his partner.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. You remember that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I remember that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One word to I.A. and he walks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe not. We could talk to Buck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing like Mike Flynn. We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And every bastard like him. We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. Every last one. And I am not going to let that happen. No deals. No compromises. No discussions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a hanger.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, Will. You grab on to something and you don't let it go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a handkerchief. Wipes his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else. I can't tell any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(steps back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can tell you one thing. I'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff. Breaking the rules. Cleaning up messes. We're a dying breed, Will. You're a dying breed. I.A., the D.A., all those reporters - they don't care what you did at Leland Street seven years ago. They don't care that you've made this your life. They don't care about getting the bad guy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will turns on his partner, eyes burning.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The partners, lock eyes. Years of working together. A thousand things unsaid. Hap reaches for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're watching us, Will. Like it or not. They're watching us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will's asleep. Kay Connell's folder open on his chest. It's dark in his room, quiet. Suddenly the shade on his window quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will's eyes pop open. He rolls over to look at the clock: 3:15. Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window. We can see the rest of his scar. Runs down deep across his sternum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks the shade back down. It bucks, then settles. Satisfied, Will returns to bed. Plumps the pillow, pulls the blanket up around him. Closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shade lurches halfway. Then SNAPS back up. Light pours in. Will's eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to be kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat around his collar. He looks out over the harbor. Fishing boats coming in with their early morning haul. More halibut. He checks his watch. Slows to a walk. Looks up and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge. Smiles. Holds up some car keys.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie driving. A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view mirror. Will in the passenger seat. Wearing a crisp suit. Ellie hands him a take-out bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brought you a bear claw. Just in case you were hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will takes the bag. Looks inside. Yikes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Local delicacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think I'll pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the bag on the dash. Looks out the window. Nightmute's main street. A line of shops. Undistinguished Town Hall. Elementary school up on a hill. Sign out front: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of calls you get around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. You know. Small-time stuff. Nothing like what you must get. Mostly drinking-related problems. Domestic abuse. Barroom fights. Stuff like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She shifts down. Takes a steep turn.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the summer months it's pretty quiet. That's when there's work out on the boats. The rest of the year, though...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a MAN walking along the road. Gnarled walking stick. Ellie calls out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, there, Joe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOE waves. They pass.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Joe Willy. Took his family hostage in November. That was the most exciting thing that happened last year. I wasn't there, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grinds gear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks over at her. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they're so boring. All small stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all about the small stuff. Small lies. Small mistakes. Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. It's human nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over. Ellie's listening intently.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to write that down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Stops. Looks over. Realises Will's teasing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small ranch house. Aluminum siding. FLOWERS piled up by the front door. TEDDY BEARS. RIBBONS. Left by well-wishers.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me not to touch anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. CONNELL, a big woman with a thick grey braid down her back, opens the door to her daughter's room. Looks at Will.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CONNELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in keeping a child's room like a shrine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CONNELL>
<DIRECTION>
Will heads into the room. Hap follows. A palpable uneasiness between them. Fred and Ellie stand in the doorway. Mrs. Connell turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small bedroom. Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on the ceiling. Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the walls. A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will stands in the middle of the room. Taking it in.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Typical seventeen year-old.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She went to a party Friday night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Fred throws Ellie a look. "Kids?" She's practically a kid herself. Will opens the top drawer of the bureau. Roots beneath the panties.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
On top of the bureau, a stack of photos. A couple torn up. Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair. Laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She left the party early. Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Around twelve-thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed. A bell JINGLES when he shakes it. Will crosses to a closet in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was the last one to see her alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Randy Stetz. Her boyfriend. We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Will pulls a dress out of the closet. Small, black, elegant. The tag's been cut out. He pulls out another, then another. Feels the fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are designer. Expensive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could Randy Stetz afford these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Fred and Ellie exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He fixes boat engines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks around. Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table. Pulls out a pretty gold necklace. Holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kay Connell had an admirer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the dresses to Ellie. Heads out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to talk to the boyfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't seem all that sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The shoulder jerks away. PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room. Longish blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to grow a moustache.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't had a chance! You fuckers been all over my back since Monday!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a cigarette. It's bent. He lights it. Hap sits opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know smoking stunts your growth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Randy throws him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay, fat-ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<HAP>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles at Will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More Alaskan hospitality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
Will goes over to a coffee machine. Pours a cup.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you love her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kay Connell. Did you love her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Randy flicks his ash. Shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. She was nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Will turns with his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"She was nice." Wow. That makes me all soft inside. Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me that time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she was seeing someone else on the side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Randy glares.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I don't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After that she left the party to go to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should I know?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ran like hell to go to him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the collar. Nose to nose.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you listen to me, you little shit. This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me. You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else. You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Randy's lip curls. Red-faced.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Will walking out of the interrogation room. Ellie joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a little surly, isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will smooths back his hair. Checks his tie.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace from Kay's room. Hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to check this out, Ellie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>

Will stops. Ellie stops. Will puts a hand on her shoulder.

<WILL>

	The small things - remember? The second you're about to dismiss something - look at it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie smiles, teasing.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to write that down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will, has to smile. She's quick. Looks down the hall. A bearded GUY on crutches. Ellie follows his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. He's up next.

The Pioneer Lodge restaurant. Small, dark wood, a RADIO playing something between Bluegrass and Folk. Some rough- looking GUYS at the bar. Throwing looks over at...

</WILL>
<HAP>

Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks. A couple paper bags and a megaphone. They're comparing guns.

Fred tenses.

Hap. Will. Farrell. Fred. Fanning out. Silent. Keeping eye-contact. Will points to Farrell. Wants the megaphone. Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out. Accidentally keys it. The feedback SQUAWKS. Fuck.

The men jump into action. Race down towards the cabin.

Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks. Will and Hap, harder going. Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small crevices. Rocks sticking out every which way. The fog, thick and white...

THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin.

FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down. Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...

EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach. Stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all sound. Like a strange dream. Eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will blinks against the thick whiteness. Strains to hear any sound, anything. There's only the distant LAPPING of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog. Quick, careful steps. Stumbles over a rock. Waves his gun in defense. Eyes wide open like a blind man...
</DIRECTION>

SUDDENLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a GUNSHOT. Off to the right. Will whips his head around.

	Over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few seconds to listen, to adjust. Heart POUNDING. Blood pumping. Like an animal tracking its prey. Leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY

flashes past him. The killer! Inches away. Will wheels around...

</VOICE>

The fog starts to dissipate. They reach the water to see...

<CHIEF_NYBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you need a glass of this.

</CHIEF_NYBACK>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head. Stands. Paces. Rakes his hand through his hair.

Will clenches his fists.

</DIRECTION>
<WILL>

Nyback catches his arm.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open. Runs down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple industrial trash bins. Will leans his hand against the wall and vomits. Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping from his mouth. Braces himself. Heaves again. Hears a BUZZING behind him. Turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEAD DOG lying next to a dumpster. FLIES buzzing around its head. Teeth bared. Eyes wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like it's watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIONEER LODGE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will walks up to reception. No one there. Just wants his key. Rings the bell. In the back room, he hears a RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect. He was forty-five...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO>
<DIRECTION>
It clicks off abruptly. Rachel appears in the doorway. Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about your partner.

</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks at her. She walks over to the desk.

<RACHEL>

<WILL>

PAUSE. A bemused VOICE on the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<WARFIELD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Dormer. I've been trying to reach you. I was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective Eckhart. It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning.

	What do you mean, "Funny?"

</WILL>
<WARFIELD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, nothing. Just that I felt Detective Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting to make a real connection before you left. I sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest. Did you sense anything like that, Detective? I mean, as his partner?...
	</DIALOGUE>

Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.

Will turns from Rachel. Eyes burning. Voice steady.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why everyone hates you, Warfield? It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself. Well I got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because I'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of. You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner!

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Fog everywhere. Dense. White. Suffocating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're running through it. Clambering over rocks. Hearing the sound of our own BREATHING. Our own HEARTBEAT. Adrenaline pumping. An animal tracking its prey...
</DIRECTION>

SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE

flashes past. Just inches away. Playing with us. Taunting us. We whip round with our weapon and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! Will bolts upright in bed. A film of sweat over his body. Breathing hard. The sound that woke him: the window shade FLAPPING open. LIGHT floods the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will gets up. Goes over to the shade and pulls it down. It lurches up halfway. He tugs it down again. It slaps all the way open. Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit!

He gets tangled in it.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The digital clock flips to a new minute: 4:23. Will, pacing. Scratching at his stubble. Unable to sleep. Keeps stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room. Hovers. Lightly pushes the door open. Sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PICTURES on the bedside table. A WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS. Hap's family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water gushing out of the faucet. Will's WATCH sitting on the sink's edge. 5:18.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle of aspirin. Shakes out a couple. Cups his hand under the water and knocks the pills back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closes the medicine cabinet and CRIES out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAP'S REFLECTION

looming behind him.

CLOSE ON running shoes, POUNDING the tarmac. PULL BACK to reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street. Eyes bloodshot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COUPLE NATIVE ALASKANS walking into a hardware store. Stop talking and glance over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG MOTHER in her husband's work shirt. Lifts her small KIDS into the cab of a 4x4. Watches him pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLDER MAN fixing the broken "E" on his store front. Turns at the sound of Will's footfall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone edgy. Cautious. A murderer amongst them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will continues on. Looking straight ahead. Wipes the sweat from his neck. Slows to a stop just outside the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window. Below, a painted sign: We miss you, Kay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stack of newspapers by the front door. The "Nightmute Ledger." The headline: Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect.
</DIRECTION>

Will picks one up. Stares down at it. Rain starts to dot the paper.

Rain hammering against the windows. Chief Nyback addresses the bullpen. Everyone's there except Farrell.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_NYBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirty-seven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case. I had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years. He was a fine detective and an even better man.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_NYBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Then let's get to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF_NYBACK>

Feet shuffling. Chairs scraping the floor as people get up. A sense of determination in the air. Will grabs his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Dormer?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Could you, just to be accurate, for the report, could you just point out where you were when you saw Detective Eckhart yesterday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out the map. It's of the small stretch of coastline. Red circles marking various points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks down at her. Takes the map. Turns it around.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good to be accurate, Ellie. You're doing your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the map. Ellie watching his face.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry about what happened. I know you did everything you could...

Will points to a spot. Cutting her off.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Hands her back the map. Smiles. Just then Fred walks up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dormer. Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.

</FRED>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.

</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls on his coat and heads for the door. Fred watches him leave. Sticks a toothpick in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Partner or no partner. That guy's a prick.

A SNICKERS BAR is tossed onto his lap. He looks up. Face brightens.
</DIRECTION>
<FARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Dormer!

Farrell bites into the candy bar.

<FARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, a real tear-jerker. Brody, the good guy, just got shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARRELL>
<DIRECTION>
He stops chewing. Realises the association. Swallows uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<FARRELL>
<DIRECTION>

	Oh. I'm sorry. About Hap. Detective Eckhart.

	He would have liked that.

</WILL>
<FARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARRELL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.

</FARRELL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything. It's important.

</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers. Like a little boy. Furrows his brow, trying to remember.
</DIRECTION>
<FARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty much nothing. That fog was so thick. The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere. I don't even remember seeing any shapes. Then I saw you. But only when you came up close. Then you disappeared again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I heard more than I saw.

Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup. Pretty, freckled face. Not much older than Kay Connell.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time for your meds.

</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will.

<FARRELL>

Lonnie gives him the cup.

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the leg?

</WILL>
<FARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know. Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.

</FARRELL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Got lost in the rocks.

</WILL>
<FARRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Will walks down the hallway. Light pouring in from a set of high windows. He looks tired. Set-upon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV of SOMEONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATCHING HIM. From a doorway. Not close, not far. A HAND comes into view. Small. Bruised knuckles. Holds on to the door jamb. Watches as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will suddenly stops. Skin prickling at the back of his neck. Turns and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN in a wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of NURSES laughing at check-in.

	You're supposed to be Farrell. Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain.

	C'mon, Ellie. What's it matter?

</FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK! Kepp takes the picture.

EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

	<DIALOGUE>
	...shortly after hearing the second shot, Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body, lying approximately fifteen feet away.

</WILL>

The Officers nod, put the car in reverse. Fred saunters over. Nods towards the searchers.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think they should start further back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Will shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had to have exited here. Over those boulders. I saw him move, he's nimble. Would have taken the hardest way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Fred shrugs, skeptical. Just then, his cell phone BLEATS. He reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>

	Duggar...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>

A local WOMAN. At the end of the line. Glances over her shoulder. Looks at Will. Smiles. You'll help us catch him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key. Looks about a hundred years old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will enters the lobby. Soaked through. Carrying an armload of wet files. Rachel turns, sees him. Reaches over to an umbrella stand. Hands him an umbrella.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. It's on the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will takes it. Preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He starts up the stairs. Notices Rachel straining to return the key to the top of the clock. Backtracks to help her. She gets it without his help.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know why I bother. It's been broken for two years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Habit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>

Rachel looks at him. Can't figure this guy out. Remembers something.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. A man came by to see you earlier. Said he was your new partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
A TINGLE skips down Will's spine. He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fred Duggar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not expecting anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what he thinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he look like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel thinks for a second. Leaning against the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Short. Dark hair. Not that memorable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will nods, rubs his forehead. Suddenly has a pounding headache. Turns for the stairs. Hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to borrow something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a nail. One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into the wall. PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a blanket to one side of the window. An ad hoc curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes that side. Starts to stretch the blanket across the window. Hesitates. Looks outside. To the left. To the right. To see if anybody's out there. If anybody's watching. Sees instead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor. Pulling a huge freighter. Will squeezes his eyes shut. Opens them again. Pulls the blanket fully across the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FILES spread across the floor. Their edges buckled from the rain. Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell. School records. Private letters. Health files. Coroner's report.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will. Pacing. Back and forth. Thinking. Over that same SQUEAKY floorboard. The clock reads: 1:05.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will lying in bed. On top of the blanket. Wide awake. Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR. Into Hap's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge. Jams his hands in his pockets. The walk of an insomniac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will walking down main street. In the middle of the road. The dead of night. No cars. The sky a blinding white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights flickering. A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle. Birds SINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not day. Not night. Stuck somewhere in between. Like a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turns down a side street. Passing more stores. Guns and Ammo. Patty's Hair and Nails. General Store. Comes upon
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where he vomited the day before. Stops. Sees the DEAD DOG, still down at the end. Half obscured by the dumpster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will wavers, pale. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows. Big. Wild-eyed. Awakened from his sleep. Will, quickly backtracks to the sidewalk. Spooked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball. He turns. In the distance. Nightmute Elementary School.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Little League game in full swing. The uniforms, a little faded. The diamond, a little unkempt. A smattering of SPECTATORS. Mostly dads with six-packs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will wanders over to the fence. Spots Ellie sitting alone on the bottom bleacher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV OF SOMEONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATCHING HIM. From afar. The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a few seconds. Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and sits down next to Ellie. She turns, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>

	Detective Dormer! What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's two-thirty in the morning. Shouldn't you be asleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will glances out at the game.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could say the same thing about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of the night. It's the best time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's playing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in extra innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She sips on a take-out coke. Looks back at the game. A plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat. Blows a bubble.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile. Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay, Lib!
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Usually she's better.

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She your only sibling?

</WILL>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve years younger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Libby takes another swing. Connects with the ball. Drops the bat and runs to first. Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you? You have any siblings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubs his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I had a brother. He died when I was eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie, sits up...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I shouldn't have...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Happened a long time ago. He was killed in a fire. In New Mexico.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must have been awful for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will leans back. Stretching his legs. Remembering.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember I was more embarrassed that he had died. Embarrassed that it made me different. So I didn't tell the other kids at school what had happened. They'd ask me where he was, where he'd gone. And I'd make up stories. He was visiting an aunt up north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a Swiss boarding school. Stuff like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice kid, huh? Just kept making up more and more lies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he stops talking. Slowly sits up. Sensing something. Ellie, noticing the shift.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The row of DADS behind them. Jump up and start CHEERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV OF THE PERSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATCHING WILL. Sees him sit up. Look around. That same prickle at the back of his neck. A KID slides home just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Will stands. Trying to shake the feeling.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(unsure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to go, scanning the area. Ellie calls after him.

</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Stops at an open doorway in time to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORONER pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of Hap Eckhart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will's heart lurches. He grabs on to the door jamb. Wasn't ready for that. The coroner looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective. Thought you were sending one of your lackeys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
Will clears his throat. Closes his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was better if I came. Under the circumstances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The coroner nods. Goes to wash her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's different when you know them, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods to clipboard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just sign over there and she's all yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
Shrugs off her lab coat. She's wearing a blue dress. Looks like a piano teacher. Heads into an adjoining office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will. Alone. Steps into the room. The smell of formaldehyde. Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray. Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape under the sheet when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down. Thick fingers. Wedding band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will jumps...
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your partner didn't suffer much...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila envelope. Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen.
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe for a minute or two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
Will rubs his face. Tries to focus on the clipboard. The coroner holds out the envelope. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CORONER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just enough time to reflect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORONER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>

INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock. Opens with a CLICK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room. Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER. The evidence locker. Room's stuffed with old files and boxes. MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over a small window. Will glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's with all the moose antlers around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Fred throws a look over his shoulder. Opens the locker.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of moose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope. The name on this one: Farrell Brooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred reaches back for the other envelope. Will, hesitant to give it to him. Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner. Hands it over. Wipes his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's Rich coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Fred slides it in beside Farrell's. Closes the locker door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call him now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First I need a copy of the key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't Seattle, Detective. We don't have copies.

<DIRECTION>
(holds up key)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the only one.
	</DIALOGUE>

</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna check up on me every...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Then...the VOICE. A MAN's voice. Not John Warfield's. This voice is medium-ranged. Higher. Nose sounds stuffed.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you haven't been getting much sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Will straightens. Something weird.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
A little TITTER on the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lower-48s. You think the white nights are kind of neat. Then you can't sleep for days. I've seen it happen about a million times. But you can't sleep for a different reason.

</MAN_S_VOICE>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Will, furrows his brow.

<MAN_S_VOICE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will Dormer's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As all the blood drains from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As all SOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fades around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his heart
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to POUND against his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falters, reaching out for the desk. To steady himself. As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him. Eyes, darting around the bullpen...
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto, into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you listen to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<MAN_S_VOICE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. The line goes dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, throat constricted. Listening to the DIAL TONE. Smiles back at Nyback. Turns. Slowly hangs up the phone. White as a sheet. Trying to act normal. Trying to act calm. SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different. Looks over at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk. He reaches for it. Carefully, rips the packing tape. Bends back a flap. Inside, some dark blue material. An embroidered daisy.

Kay Connell's knapsack.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective Dormer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>

He closes his eyes. Now is not the time. Reaches the Cherokee. Yanks open the driver's side door. Ellie catches up with him. Out of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like you're in a hurry. I just wanted to ask you about these pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS. They're of the BEACH. The ones Kepp took. Almost all fog.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I know they're not great quality, but this is where you said you were when you first saw Detective Eckhart, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will. Barely glancing at them. Tosses the box into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Gets in and closes the door. Puts his hand over the box. Ellie comes up to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But here's the thing. I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there. I mean, not in that fog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then change it.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Listen, Ellie. I don't have time for this shit. Five feet, seven feet, twenty feet. Put down whatever you want in your report, alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the ignition. Pulls out with a SQUEAL. Ellie steps back, watching him drive away. More curious than stung.

EXT. OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

The Cherokee. Parked off-road. A remote spot by the water. The driver's side door, left open. The PING-PING-PING of the interior BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BREAKFRONT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront. Aimless. One foot in front of the other. Staring out at nothing. The endless sea. Waves CRASHING. Wind HOWLING. Seagulls SCREECHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything. Closing in on him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles over a rock. Grabs his head in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned. Guilty. Ashamed. Fucked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He saw it. He saw it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAVE, explodes nearby. Drenching him in sea spray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will turns, raking his hand across his face. Blinking. Eyes stinging. Trying to focus. Trying to think this through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shakes his head. Looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Got to deal with the problem at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge. The shoulders of his coat still wet with sea spray. Crosses to the area of the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot. Testing. Testing. Until...he finds the one that SQUEAKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets down on his knees. Hesitates. Then jams his fingers in around the loose board. Starts pulling it up. Face reddening. Knuckles whitening. Slips his hand into the gap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls out a muddy 357 RUGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killer's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, stares down at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, standing at the mouth of the ALLEY. Just like the night before. Steps inside. Cautious. Eyes darting. Peering into the shadows for the HOMELESS MAN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not there. Coast's clear. Heads for the dumpster at the end of the alley. Shoves it aside. Looks down at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEAD DOG. Rancid. Rotting. Will gags. Holds a handkerchief to his face. Waving away the flies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then. Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket. Shrugs his coat off and wraps it around his hand and the gun. Looks away. Fires a muffled SHOT into the dog's side. The body kicks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouches down. Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's point of entry. Finds it. Pulls out a PENKNIFE and extends one of the blades. Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep for the lodged bullet. He finds it. Pulls it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks back at the dog. Takes a deep breath. Wipes his brow. A little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead. Turns and pulls a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL from his pocket. Douses the bullet. Cleaning it. Glancing at his watch. Running out of time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen. Hears VOICES. Nearby. Ducks back. Waiting for them to fade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Safe. Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM. Glancing briefly at the PICTURES hanging on the wall. Of old time POLICE OFFICERS. Striking brave poses...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storage room. Hot. Stifling. The moose antlers LOOMING over his shoulder. Will pulls the evidence locker key from his pocket. Unlocks the padlock. Swings the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out. Throwing a look over his shoulder. Opens it. Shakes out the bullet that was lodged in Hap's spine. Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket. The bullet he shot into the dead dog. Drops that into the envelope and reseals it. Hands shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something. Catches the corner of his eye. He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror. The blood smear still on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dormer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Will jumps. Quickly wipes the smear off and turns. Fred Duggar standing behind him. RICH by his side. Will clears his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand. Then Farrell's. Angry.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These should have gone out two hours ago.
	</DIALOGUE>

SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him. Fred and Rich exchange a glance.

<YOUNG_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And always, always with a smile on her face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The young girl looks up. Folds the paper closed. People SNIFFLE. Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm.

Some CHILDREN. Start circulating with plastic buckets. Filled with white carnations. Handing them out.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's casket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane. Two GIRLS, look like sisters, holding each other up. A MAN with a thick red beard. A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with a pink ribbon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, looks away. Then. At the end of the line. Something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY STETZ
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in tight jeans and a down vest. In front of him stands a GIRL with white-blonde hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room.

PULL BACK to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore. Still in his funeral clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the "Mystery!" section. Not finding what he wants. Then, something catches his eye: A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the aisle. Will limps down to it. Avoides eye-contact with a YOUNG WOMAN shelving "New Arrivals!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches into the bin. Rummages through some paperbacks. Then he finds it: Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd. Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for: Another J. Brody Mystery. Flips to the inside of the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd. Head turned to the side. Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada. He graduated...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will's eyes skip down to the bottom:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks up. Slaps the book closed.

INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY

With a CLICK the door swings open. Will, gloves on, pockets his credit card. Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as

TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING. Will's prepared. Takes a bag of treats from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucy. Desi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The dogs break. Trot over to him. Wolf down the treats. Will scans the place. Small, cheap. Matching sofa and easy chair, corduroy upholstery. The walls, lined with old 1950s movie posters. All second-rate detective movies: "Another Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will walks across the room. Repulsed. The pathetic hovel of a killer. Looks into the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Single bed. Books and magazines. A half-eaten tuna sandwich on the bedside table. "NYPD BLUE" calendar on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's quiet. He walks over to a large DESK by the window. Scattered papers. Computer. Mini cassette recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles. Some yellowing, some fresh. All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life!" "Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will curls his lip. Starts looking through the papers on the desk. Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH. It's of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE. A RADIO TOWER in the background. Walter Byrd's face is blurred, turned to the side. The photo from the book bio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will takes it. Starts roughly opening drawers. A box of animal crackers, a rubber band ball. Then, shoved in the back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK. Will flips through to today's date. Blank. Shoves the book into his pocket. Slams the door closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13. Checks the magazine. Slaps it back in place. He's ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY the phone RINGS. A beige rotary on the desk. Plugged into an ancient answering machine. It RINGS again. The answering machine WHIRS. Then BEEPS.
</DIRECTION>

	...I'm not coming home. So you shouldn't wait there all day. I mean, they'll wonder about you at the station. You should be careful about following procedure, Will, especially now that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Will lunges for the phone. Snatches it up just as CLICK! the tape cuts off.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will exits the apartment. Cradling his hand. Looks down at the tile floor. Scanning it for a broken tile. Finds one. Bends down and plucks out a broken corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the door jamb. Just then. His BEEPER goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will strides into the bullpen. Wounded hand in pocket. Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter. Glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred, over in the corner. SLAMS a drawer in the filing cabinet. Turns.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget your pager?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beeped you over two hours ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Holds out a one-page report.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a fax from the lab. Murder weapon was a 357 Ruger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Will takes the report. Heads over to the coffee machine.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And something else that might interest you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book. Holds it up. Otherwise Engaged. In hardback.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Will blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Will pours himself a cup of coffee. Trying to keep the stream steady. Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK...
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(opens it up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's signed. Personally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a local writer. Kay had all his books. I think we should check it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin. Looks back at the report. Judicious.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it'll lead anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The CLACKING stops. SILENCE. Will turns around. Ellie's staring right at him - that isn't like him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to Fred. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. If he's local. Give him a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The CLACKING resumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark stairway. Late at night. Will, bathed in shadows. Climbs to the top. Quietly, carefully. He heads down a hallway. We recognise it. Back where Walter Byrd lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will approaches apartment "B." Slowly pulls out his weapon. Cocks it. Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door. Ready to fight. Ready to confront. Looks down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tile corner's still there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open. Scrawled in pencil: 8:30. Dr. Agee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee. The appointment book on the passenger seat. Been there all night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Insomnia. Taking its toll. His hair, no longer neatly combed. His face, pale and unshaven. His eyes, dragged open from fatigue. Looks like the whole world's pulling him down. Staring down the street at a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRICK BUILDING on the corner. A placard by the front door: Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will checks his watch. Rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands. Suddenly. Something tells him to look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the distance, walking along the road. Towards Dr. Agee's. He's in his forties. Short, shoulders sloped. Wears a beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER BYRD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has a bulky hearing aid in one ear. Is looking down at the road. Glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCKS EYES WITH WILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Byrd, slows his pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, reaches for the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER BYRD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road. Veers over to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a runner's stride. Weaves through PEOPLE. Closing in on Byrd. Sees his plan. Cuts across the road just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PICK-UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rounds the corner. THUMP! Broadsides him. Will's pitched up and over the hood. Falls hard on the tarmac. Dazed for a second. Blood, gushing from his forehead. Hears the PICK-UP DOOR open...FEET running over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright? You popped out from nowhere!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
More FEET running over.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Will opens his eyes. Trying to focus. Looks up and sees, in the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will struggles to his feet. The OLD LADY who hit him, wearing overalls. Reaches out.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you should move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
Will stands, wavering. Flashes her his badge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. PICK-UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old lady rips along in the truck. Will sits in the passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead. It's soaked with blood. The lady looks over.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you're okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<OLD_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful not to bleed on my interior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks over at her. Shifts in his seat. Ouch. Feels like a couple cracked ribs. Peers out the windshield at the TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus. A windy coastal road. Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERRY STATION - OUTSIDE UMKUMIUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FERRY at the end of the pier. A small wooden booth for selling tickets. Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains on the other side of the bay. Nothing else for miles around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars. Will jumps out. Scans the area for Byrd. Nothing. Then, sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water. Most everyone is inside. TOURISTS with throw-away cameras, backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN. Some looking sea-sick in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will weaves through the crowd. Eyes darting, searching. The ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER BYRD standing by a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINDOW - FERRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter holds on to the railing. Looking at the view, the sea spray. Will comes up. Stands next to him. Cognizant of the people around them.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter Byrd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter continues looking out the window. That same stuffed- nose voice.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver. We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm. Right from under her arm. That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions. Stood the whole time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The ferry pitches again. Will grabs on to the railing. Looking down at this little man. Hate in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His uniform looked brand new. His shoes and badge were polished, his billy club, his belt buckle. All perfect. He was like a soldier, but better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter reaches up to blow his nose. Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen. From beating Kay Connell to death.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made a huge impression on me. His goodness. Gave me an instant respect for the police. I tried to become a cop when I left high school, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He points to his hearing-aid.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congenital problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop. Walter smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. We're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gendreau Glacier. Spilling down between two huge mountains. Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other tourists. Walter leads the way. Hands in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He points off to the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And on a clear day you can see all the way over to Newtok. There's a beautiful aviary over there. We can go sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will's lip curls. Watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's actually cool for this time of year. Normally the temperature runs about...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY Will lunges at him. Walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar. Nose to nose. Will barely keeping control.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this is a nice meeting we're having here? Friendly? Two people getting acquainted?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(jerks him harder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sick, coward, fuck. I get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down. Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death. Washing her afterwards, cleaning her. Make you feel like a real man?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tightens his grip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter flounders.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I outta end this right now. Take a rock and smash your fucking skull in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
His jaws tense, nostrils flare. Walter, red-faced, sputtering...
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stood right behind you...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will clenches his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Seattle's great hero. Shooting his own partner. I saw it all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was an accident! You hear me? I didn't know it was him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes him hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know it was him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Just then a SHRIEK. Will looks over
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COUPLE KIDS. Further down the glacier. Having a snowball fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks back at Walter. Has to take it easy. Shoves him away in disgust. Walter falls down onto the snow. Dislodges his hearing aid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watches Will pace. Head throbbing. Ribs, screaming in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why lie about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid. Puts it back around his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I'm all for bending the truth. That's what I do in my novels. It's my trade you might say. But why cover it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Gets up. Brushes the snow from his butt. Checks something in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I'm sure you have some reason. Something noble. I have faith in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Looks down at the kids. Shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They should be bundled up better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your game, Byrd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The phone call. The knapsack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured we're partners on this one. I mean, after what I saw...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will stops short. Eyes burning. It's all he can do not to throttle this weed.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get one thing straight, Byrd. We are partners on nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks at him. Scratches his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I research my novels. I know the procedures. You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry. You'd have called for back- up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment. You're a well-respected detective. There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a handkerchief. Blows his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...except that we could help each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. We're at an impasse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will runs his hands through his hair. Half-crazed. Heart pounding. Turns to watch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KIDS down the glacier. Making angels in the snow. Their GIGGLES carried along by the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, squeezes his eyes shut. Trapped. About to defy every instinct in his body.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to get a phone call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said you're going to get a phone call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(perks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you might find that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to be brought in for questioning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter smiles. Pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down at the station?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(hisses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes down at the station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter rubs his hands together. Thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. Brought in for questioning. Good. I can write this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN. Low and loud. Walter looks down at it.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ferry's leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts down. Will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow. Walter, going over the details in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something to divert...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Snaps his fingers. An idea.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My gun. You still have my gun, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will nods. Walter smiles. Spreads out his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then that's the wild card. Every detective story has a wild card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, "wild card?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
TOURISTS. Boarding the ferry.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter heads over to the ramp. Will stops, grabbing his side. A PANG through his ribs. Excruciating. Calls out to Walter.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean "wild card?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks back. Waves.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll know. At the questioning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER. Gets on. Walks back to the stern. Looks out at Will. The HORN sounds again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter, at the rail. Smiles. The ferry's engine, churning up water. Starting forward just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket. Holds it up for Will to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, on shore, sees it. A cold flash ripping through his body. That motherfucker. Bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in. The Ticket Taker, grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<TICKET_TAKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Full up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TICKET_TAKER>
<DIRECTION>
Will, jerks his arm away. Stares off at the ferry. Walter Byrd and his tape recorder. Receding into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a counter top. Stuff thrown down. Aspirin. Band- aids. Gauze. Medical tape. First aid cream. Back pills. Sleeping pills. Bottle of scotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the convenience store. His entire body aching. The CASHIER, throws him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will exits the store. A bag under his arm. We Miss You, Kay looming over his shoulder. Steps out onto the sidewalk and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE leaning against her truck. Waiting for him. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which way are you walking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A tingle, all across Will's body. Christ. This girl's everywhere! He hunches into his coat. Flicks up his collar. Doesn't want her to see him fully. Nods down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to the Lodge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie grabs her bag. Joins him. They start walking.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I needed to get your signature on something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a folder from her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The report on Detective Eckhart. Chief made me finish it this morning. Said it was taking too long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will takes the file. Flips it open. The death of his partner. Neatly typed. Neatly stapled. Pulls out a pen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you going to read it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He signs. Hands it back to her. She slips it into her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I can help you with the Connell case. That writer's coming in tomorrow. Walter Byrd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A slight stutter in Will's step.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duggar called him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street. Studying his face. His gait. Noticing the slight limp in his right leg. The cut on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't been sleeping much, have you, Detective Dormer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop? A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing. A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said that once, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Will, finally looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But it sounds like something I would've said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Turns and starts up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>

INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clock flicks to 3:00 A.M. Will, pacing in his room. Shirt off. Rib cage wrapped in a bandage. Looking through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STACK OF MESSAGES. All from John Warfield. He discards them one by one. Can barely focus...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY the phone RINGS. He lunges for it.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>

Interrupted by a CLICK...
</DIRECTION>
<RECORDED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him...

<DIRECTION>
Walter Byrd's voice. Recorded from that afternoon.

Then, another clumsy CLICK. Walter Byrd gets on.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have done the same thing, Will. I know you would...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will SLAMS down the receiver. Then again. And again. Yanks the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The DARK FIGURE. Disappearing back into the fog. Closing in around him like milky water...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We whip out our SMITH 39/13...plunge in after him...taking chase...BREATHING hard...leaping from rock to rock...the FOG, blanket thick...tightening around us...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our feet. Hit water. Up to our ankles. Icy cold. We run...sloshing through...when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK FIGURE. Appears ahead. Big and hulking...CRASHING towards us...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE emerges...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in a split second...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! We fire! The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heart POUNDING. Adrenaline PUMPING. We slosh towards the body. Something...catching our eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 357 RUGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying in the rocks. Off to the side. We grab it. Turn back to the body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And stop cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's when it hits us. That's when we realize...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Will bolts up. White as a sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
His body, drenched in sweat. His breathing, quick and ragged. Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed. Looks across the room and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting in the corner. Eating an apple with a penknife.
</DIRECTION>
<HAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure about that, buddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAP>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles. Sympathetic. Looks over at the window just as...

The BLANKET. Drops to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHT floods the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a GRUNT Will puts his back into it. Shoving the heavy oak bureau towards the window. Sweat beading his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A...few...more...shoves. And the bureau finally stands in front of the window. WIll stands back to take a look. Only covers half of it.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

CUT BACK TO:

With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window. Light still shining through the cracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows. Anything. To fill the cracks. To cover the light. His eyes. Like a crazy man's...

SUDDENLY a knock on the door. Will turns.

Will grabs up a sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He heads back over to the window. Rachel now notices all the stuff piled up. Softens her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did something happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will. Cramming the sweater into a crack.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel walks up behind him. His cramming, more desperate. More urgent.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will...

</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>

Rachel reaches out. Catches his arm.

He stops. Looks down at her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will suddenly realises what he's doing. Absurd. Pathetic. Pitiful. Slowly turns to face Rachel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes, looking up at him. His shoulders droop. Exhausted. Rachel reaches up. Catches him in her arms. Strong arms. Caring. Will buries his face in her neck. Wants to be swallowed up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel holds him. Arms encircling. Will breathes her in. Sweet, soft, safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks up. His mouth suddenly finding hers. A kiss, hungry, urgent. His arms move to surround her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Rachel in bed. Spooning. Rachel behind will, her finger tracing his scar. Rain DRUMS against the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will. Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass. Casting strange shadows against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was this guy named Weston Dobbs. Twenty-four. Worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store. Every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street. And every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again. He did this for about six months. Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. Kept him in his apartment for three days. Tortured him. Raped him. Made him do things...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Will tenses his jaw. Rachel, listens in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he was done, he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building. But he didn't do a good enough job. The little boy's neck didn't break and he died from shock. The landlord found him five days later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel reaches for Will's hand. Squeezes it.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of your cases?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and Hap. A year and a half ago. I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty. Smug, cold. Dead eyes. We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it. Nothing concrete. Went over every inch of that apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will turns slowly over to face her. Her hair, splayed out on the pillow. Her cheeks, flushed. Her eyes, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arrested him the next day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel looks at him. Goose pimples on her arms. Realising the weight of the confession.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There've been other cases. Where we've changed results. Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubs his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Dobbs. I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up. Abrupt. Wincing from the pain in his ribs. Rests his arms on his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if someone finds out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're under investigation now. Back in Seattle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel rubs his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's not going to happen now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Will closes his eyes. The rain, PATTERING. Rhythmic.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think it was wrong? What we did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
There's a PAUSE. Rachel, studying Will's back. The cuts. The bruises. Not sure how to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two kinds of people in Alaska. Those who were born here and those who've come here to escape something in their lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't born here, Will. I'm in no position to judge anyone. I'm not about that any more.

Looks out the window.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock reads 6:00. Will pulls on his trousers. Goes to strap on his Smith 39/13 holster. Grimaces with pain. Looks at his back in the full-length mirror. BLACK BRUISES seeping out from under his bandage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau. Turns and looks down at Rachel. Sleeping soundly.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fred sits opposite him. Report file open. Ellie, next to Fred. Taking notes. She's combed her hair, too.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what manner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Walter smiles modestly. Looks over at Ellie.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was, not quite a "fan." More an avid reader of my detective novels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you first meet her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Fred shoots Ellie a look. She closes her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A year ago. At one of my signings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged. He holds it up. Opened to the signature.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you signed this?

</FRED>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

</WALTER>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened at that signing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She flattered me about my writing. Asked if she could visit me. To talk about my books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Not that much at first. But then she became more comfortable. Started visiting me every week...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>

Will, from over by the window. Interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the nature of your relationship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>

Walter looks over. Wide-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, Detective Dormer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will turns. Accusatory.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was an attractive girl. Did you have sex with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Walter blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was only seventeen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<WILL>

</WILL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a mentor to her.

</WALTER>

Will heads over to Walter's chair. Fists clenched in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gave her gifts.

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</WILL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.

</WILL>
<WALTER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to sit down, Detective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Tense BEAT. Will stares at Walter. Revulsion. Heads back over to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't happy. I was someone to talk to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you mean?

</FRED>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Walter hesitates. Takes a sip of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk out of school. Kay told me things in the strictest of confidence. As a friend.

</WALTER>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Byrd. Anything you can tell us could help out with this case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>

Walter furrows his brow. Taps his hearing aid.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. He hit her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie's eyes widen. Fred glances at Will. But Will's too busy watching this little man weave his web.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night. Bruises all over her back, her upper arms. I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it. Wanted to keep it a secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?

</ELLIE>
<FRED>

	Ellie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Walter looks right at her.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a terrible rage. Kay even said he carried a handgun around with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Fred stands. This is big. Calls out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Margaret! Get Judge Biggs on the phone!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get another warrant for Stetz's place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Walter takes a sip of his coffee. Cup's empty. Holds it out to Ellie. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I have some more coffee, Detective Burr?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie nods, takes the cup. Heads over to the coffee machine. Fred turns back to the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mouths the words Wild Card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shiver down Will's spine. Wild card. The gun. Randy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
over at the coffee machine. Pouring coffee. Glances up at the window. Catches the reflection of the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An intense look between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - NIGHTMUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark, narrow boarding room. A HAND reaches through an open window. Feels for the lock on the door. CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will enters Randy Stetz's place. Cigarette butts, electric guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around. Every inch of him revolting against what he's about to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of waves. A slight breeze. Ellie walking along the water.

Looking down. Brow furrowed. Stops and puts her hands on her hips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the room. Pulls it aside. A MOTORBIKE being repaired. Parts and tools all over the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief. Spots a COFFEE CAN on a shelf. Filled with thick oil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches Ellie's eye. GLINTING from between the rocks. She bends down. Pulls a pencil from her backpack. Spears something and holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHELL CASING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will, drops the 357 into the oil. Turns and heads back across the room. Hesitates. At the door. Turns back. Looking at the oil can. Takes a step back towards it when he hears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a SQUAD CAR. Pulling up outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room. UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place. Tearing down pictures. Turning out doors. Ripping up carpet. Randy's voice. In protest.

</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
More SCUFFLING. A chair knocked over. Something SMASHES. Will looks down at the floor as
</DIRECTION>

FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the doorway. Randy writhes, kicks, tugs. Screams.

Randy squirms. Turns. Looks right into Will's eyes. Gone is the bluster. Gone is the attitude. Randy Stetz, lost kid. Tears streaming down his face.

Fred sees him, heads over.

<WILL>

	I like it fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Fred pats Will's shoulder.

<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's on Nancy's mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie reaches into her vest pocket. Pulls out a Ziploc with the SHELL CASING inside.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found this out on the beach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<FARRELL>

	Let it go, Ell. We got the bad guy.

Rich throws peanut shells at her.
</DIRECTION>
<RICH>

Ellie brushes off the shells. Looks right at Will.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to Will. Their faces, spinning. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's legitimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worth pursuing?

<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The case is closed, Ellie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gets up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got the next round.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
The guys don't protest. Will starts heading for the bar. Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs. Smoke. MUSIC. Laughter. Arguing. A mass of bodies and sound. Like being swallowed up in a black hole...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks back at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM! Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of wind. Thunders up the stairs. Calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, Pop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the TV in the other room. An older MAN, Ellie's father, appears in the doorway. Thick glasses, grey stubble, big paunch. Wearing a flannel robe.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie? You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE_S_DAD>

	Where's all my academy stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on. Ellie stands beneath it. Piles of crap everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto parts. Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops. In thick black pen. Shoves a couple aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then. Finds what she's looking for. Pulls down a box marked: Ellie Acad. Tears it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS, schedules, syllabi, handbooks. Stuff from her Academy year. At the bottom, a report. The title: "Securing the Crime Scene," the Leland Street Murders. By Eleanor P. Burr.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie pulls it out. Sits down on an old stool. Opens to the middle of the report. Her finger, tracing down the typewritten page. Flips to the next page. Then the next. The next. Then. She spots it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie looks up. Chews her bottom lip.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial. Wind whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him. Next to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough. Holding on to a thick coil of rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hunches against the wind. Watches as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILL approaches the monument. Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled coat. Face drawn and haggard. Angry.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured we should touch base. Compare notes. I think it went well. What did you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will's eyes pierce into him.

<WILL>

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe we could talk some more.

</WALTER>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing more to talk about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we work so well together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will breaks. Rushes Walter. Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do nothing well together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SLAMS him again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing! You understand me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Another wave CRASHES. Sprays them. Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You run on two settings, Will. I've noticed that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Will tightens his grip.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye. That's okay. I do that too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up the tape. Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side. Yanks the tape out of the cassette. Steps back and HURLS it into the sea. Waves engulf it hungrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter watches him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
A dark shadow crosses his face. Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue. Will hisses.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't get it up, Walter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was when I went to kiss her. She started laughing. I got angry. After all I'd given her. All I'd shared with her. I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Walter. Squeezing the bronze rope.
</DIRECTION>

Their eyes, locked. Veins, popping along Walter's temples. Lip quivering...

JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance. Will looks up.

</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The never coming back part, though. I'm not sure. To tell you the truth this has been kind of fun. Going to the station, meeting all those nice people. Talking with you.

</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs. Walks past Will.

<WALTER>

CRACK! again, CRACK! again, CRACK! again. Walter's face. Calm, flushed. A vein along his temple.
