Brad LAUGHS, turning to the crowd to appreciate his lame burn... Nothing. Young Dre looks furious. Young Dre grabs the mic and the DJ spins. Young Dre proceeds to incinerate Brad. With every line, the crowd goes insane. (NOTE: Actual Young Dre Rap to Come.) As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his hand and up his arm. Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild...
