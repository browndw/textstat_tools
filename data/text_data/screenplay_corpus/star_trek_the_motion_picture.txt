TRAVELS THROUGH deep space, MOVING DIRECTLY for one pinpoint of light: a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP TOWARD IT, a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING, brightening, flaring unbelievable intensity: supernova. The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH- ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds. STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS:

EXT. AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S)

<DIRECTION>
In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes, beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing our POV, a:

<DIRECTION>
KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S)

<DIRECTION>
In a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud, which continues to grow in size as the Klingons approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon language (and symbols).

The other two ships veer off, warping around again into attack position. The THIRD SHIP has begun to implode in on itself, the matter-energy of its existence drained by the WHIPLASH BOLT that HOLDS IT.

And then... the Vulcan landscape. Harsh, strange angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend- ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. VULCAN LEDGE - SPOCK ( M & F.P.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long, harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:

In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g., the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around

Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in, intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck. But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward. She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a look with the Male Masters.

Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into the dust.

Scott is now eying Kirk just a little warily as he fol- lows him into the pod. Kirk's determined expression suggests that some chips are going to fly and Scott does not want to become one of them.

It takes Scott a moment to comprehend, and Kirk smiles now, nods:

	"Gave' her back, sir...? I doubt it was that easy...

Scott is well aware of what the Enterprise means to Kirk. As Scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best perspective, Kirk peers through the observation window, craning his head, hungry for his first glimpse of the starship. Scott is watching him, immensely pleased.

<DIRECTION>
as he watches, his face reflecting all of it: the awe, the wonder, the romance, the obsession. The one comp- lete love of his life. And with that love regained, he is becoming more fully alive again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk looks at Scott; for a moment both hold each other's eye. Scott knows precisely how Kirk feels. Both turn to the window again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome, symmetrical bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW. And it dominates Kirk's -- and our emotions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ENTERPRISE - AND THE POD (TINY IN THIS SHOT) AS IT CIRCLES - THE ANTI-LIKE FIGURES OF WORKERS (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great ship dwarfs everything. The drydock becomes a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved bulk. The tiny pod continues to move along it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small automated welding devices move along the gird- ers, working with brief, bright orange-white flares. In other areas of metal lace structure, supplies and equipment are being loaded onto the ship. The pod continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all), watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING TECHNICIANS on the drydock. Now the pod moves toward mating position. It closes in, secures itself to the outer airlock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POD - AT THE AIRLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning from the observation window. Outside, the metallic.. CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the "WHOOSH" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious moment for Kirk, and his face shows it.
</DIRECTION>

OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, "Pod secured. Pressure equalized." Scott moves the control to open the hatch.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can find my way, Ensign.

And Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him, relieved.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat, savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control panel:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridge!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur- tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's speedy trip to the Bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip- ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled. It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to- tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly working her communications station, AD LIBBING "... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency five, will someone please check me?" At the helm, sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust- ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov argues the computer is not relaying that information.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering. And then he moves forward toward the command center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain... Starfleet just signaled your transfer-of- command orders!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from the old crew: "Admiral Kirk..." "It's the Captain...!" etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them back, speaking crisply.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Uhura)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away, addresses Chekov:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we're facing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
And Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The moment the elevator doors snap closed:
</DIRECTION>
<SULU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't have wanted to have been standing in his way. He wanted her back; he got her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<ALIEN_ENSIGN>
<DIRECTION>
(perturbed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Captain Decker? He's been with the ship every minute of her refitting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIEN_ENSIGN>
<UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
(brittle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ensign -- our chances of coming back from this mission in one piece may have just doubled...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENGINEERING SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity. ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female) coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one- man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con- stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi- cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD LIBBED conversation among the Technicians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch it, sir" admonishment. Kirk moves on to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE INTERMIX CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the middle of the power shaft. Very NOISY here, and a continual CACOPHONY of COMPUTERIZED AND HUMAN VOICES calling off equipment checks. And grouped around a section of burnt-out circuitry are WILLARD DECKER, Captain's stripes, handsome, in his early 30's; Scott, and two Technicians. Decker and Scott are working feverishly uncoupling the device, probing its innards. Decker has discovered the problem, removed several transistor-type parts, taps them with a pencil-sized sonic analyzer.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly elated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought so! See... the trans- porter sensor was not activated...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(impressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, you were dead right about that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Technician)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clearly, put a back-up sensor into the unit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THEM TO KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Technician prepares to install the device, Scott glances up to see Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks from Decker to Kirk in acute embarrassment (so that we should realize Scott hasn't mentioned Kirk's taking over to Decker). Decker now notices Kirk, reacts pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admiral Kirk...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes Kirk's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're getting a top brass send off...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(self assured grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll launch on schedule if we have to tow her out with our bare hands. Right, Scotty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
(lamely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, sir, that we will...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Decker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will, let's go over here and talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates corner. Decker glances bemusedly at Kirk, then turns to Scott:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me now when the back-up is in place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS SCOTT TO KIRK AND DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Scott AD LIBS a glum "Aye, sir," and watches them walk across the Chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CORNER OF THE INTERMIX CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just a little quieter here, with Kirk and Decker arriv- ing, and Decker saying blithely:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All due respect, sir, I hope this isn't a Starfleet pep talk; I'm just too busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say it is plainly, directly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Decker seems shocked into silence; he can only peer at Kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a paternal hand on Decker's shoulder, then withdraws it and continues quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(finding his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You, personally, are assuming command?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I ask Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN B.G. (ACROSS THE ROOM)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott, working on the relay, but continually glancing at Kirk and Decker with worried concern, as Kirk replies:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at Decker, who returns the gaze with equal intensity. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Report to the bridge, Commander. Immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Decker EXITS. Kirk waits, collecting his composure as he watches him go. Then Kirk turns to glare at Scott. Interrupted by a flare as something shorts out at the mechanism where Scott and Decker had been working. Technician (Clearly) reacts, hits an inter- com button fast:
</DIRECTION>
<TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CLEARY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Transporter room, come in! Urgent!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Scott)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Redline on the transporters, Mister Scott!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Scott whirls to a console fast, speaks urgently!
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Transporter room, do not engage! Do not....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CLEARY) (reacting to the reading; interruption)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late; they're beaming now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is exiting on a run, followed by Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - INCLUDING TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unusually defective looking TRANSPORTER EFFECT in progress, alternately flashing and glowing -- even the Transporter SOUND seems wrong, as if struggling to overcome some problem. At the console, CHIEF RAND and ASSISTANT are reacting in surprised, near-horror as they attempt vainly to save the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<RAND>
<DIRECTION>
(into intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starfleet, override us! OVERRIDE...! Yank them back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAND>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from Rand's console,a VIOLENT GLARE -- a PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry. And on the con- sole a red-warning light now begins flashing.
</DIRECTION>
<STARFLEET_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unable to retrieve their pattern, Enterprise....!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STARFLEET_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con- trols. Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins manipulating the additional controls himself.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're losing the pattern...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(into intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<RAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no! They're forming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAND>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN. We RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a human WOMAN. They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN. Then, all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone; the transporter chamber is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(into intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starfleet, do you have them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
A mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and Scott look at each other again, their pained faces presaging the answer they already know:
</DIRECTION>
<STARFLEET_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaken)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enterprise... what we got back didn't live long. Fortunately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STARFLEET_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Another moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits the transmission button -- fighting to control his voice as:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starfleet... Kirk. Please... express my condolences to their families. Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(see Rand's stricken expression)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was nothing you could have done, Rand. It wasn't your fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
And before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind him. In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar- ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS move back and forth. But Kirk does not see them; his mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was there something he should have done, could have done, to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding to this terrible needs for starship command again, forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci- dent?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around, realizes he's lost track of where he is. A passing YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turboshaft eight...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<YEOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back that way, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YEOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She's indicating back the direction from which Kirk came. He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurrying down the corridor. The two face each other a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - FULL SHOT OF THE KLINGON SHIP BEING DESTROYED (AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(in the last part of the scene which showed the Klingon Captain speaking in Klingonese and an English print- out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom. The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc. And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com- ments: "My God...!" "I don't believe it...!" "What could it be...?" Etc., etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, immediately following this, on the viewer:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LUMINESCENT CLOUD (AS SEEN ON A VIEWER) (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music, only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.) The viewer goes blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECREATION DECK (M)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one wall consisting of picture windows, through which can be seen sections of the drydock structure outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On another wall is a large viewer, on which was just shown the Klingon transmission. Leading off and away from this deck area are what are obviously other specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers, game rooms, lounges, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk (now with Captain's stripes) appears. As he comes into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent. Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all we know about it; except that it's now 2.2 days from Earth. Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious. Kirk has paused a moment, now continues.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We assume there is a vessel of some type at the heart of the cloud. Our orders are to intercept, investigate; and take whatever action is necessary... and possible.

	...We can only hope that the life form aboard that vessel reasons as we do.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON UHURA

standing near an intercom, which just then has emitted a bosun's WHISTLE intercom signal.

<BRIDGE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridge to Captain. Priority signal from Epsilon Nine --

Kirk leans over to the intercom, speaks into it:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it on the viewer here...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE REC DECK VIEWER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view of Commander Branch, in the Epsilon 9 monitor room. Branch is tense, reflecting extreme urgency. Near Branch, working intently at the console are the Female Lieutenant and a Technician.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Receiving an odd pattern now..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(toward Branch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They seem to be reacting to our scans, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
(inspecting another console)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kind of energy surge...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Enterprise... they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reacts at readings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deflectors, emergency full!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
Branch hits an alarm button; we HEAR ALARM KLAXON SOUNDING. The viewer IMAGE DISTORTS, clears again while Branch -- facing his viewer, continues urgently:
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are under attack...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	External view...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE VIEWER - EXT. THE DESTRUCTION OF EPSILON 9 (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the image of Branch is immediately replaced by an external view of the plantoid, and the LUMINESCENT CLOUD (at about the same distance from which the Klingon cruisers were attacked).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it STRIKES the plantoid WITH FULL, CATACLYSMIC FORCE. The viewer IMAGE BREAKS UP -- and immediately the entire Starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of FLAR- ING ENERGY, shattered structure, flying debris. And then, all at once, there is nothing -- empty space, Epsilon 9 is gone. We SEE only the stars; and the mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: The above is entirely SILENT, and when it is finished, not a word is spoken.)
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viewer off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the viewer goes blank, all still facing the screen. Then Kirk turns to the room as if to comment. Then he stops -- nothing he can say will add at all to what they've just seen. Instead:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pre-launch countdown will commence in forty minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene they have just witnessed still vivid in their minds as they gaze somberly up toward Kirk who is exit- ing. The bridge crew follows him out. Not a word is said as the remainder of the crew waits another moment, then begins to disperse toward their duty stations too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ENTERPRISE IN DRYDOCK (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spectacular ORBIT VIEW of the giant starship in the process of release. BEYOND US, in half light, EARTH LOOMS HUGE. The dock welders are gone; the supply pods float away from the ship. Little tongues of blue flame spurt from the ship's maneuvering jets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - ON ENTERPRISE (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the large dock umbilical is released, floats free of its starship attachment. Dock departure is imminent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON DECKER - AT THE SCIENCE STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Decker (now wearing Commander stripes) reacts, almost startled, and Uhura continues:
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a Deltan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
Uhura's tone and expression convey "Deltan" in a certain, special manner.

	And there are no finer navigators in Starfleet, Commander.

The last is interrupted by:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they snap open, and there emerges a breathtakingly beautiful young woman (uniformed as a Navigator Lieu- tenant) who strides purposefully onto the bridge. A stunning figure, but hairless, entirely bald but or delicate eyebrows and eyelashes. Her bald head is not at all unattractive, in fact exudes an aura of sensual nudity. Indeed, her whole being exudes sensuality. (This is a racial characteristic, not a deliberate presence.) She approaches Kirk

<DIRECTION>
ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet, hold in unquestioned recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Ilia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Decker....!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern (it presages possible complications). Decker turns to Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was stationed on the Lieutenant's home planet some years ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his sleeve stripes.
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes his rank stripes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Commander' Decker?

(bitingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward Ilia too.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in you, too, Lieutenant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as firm as Kirk's.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By all means.

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
receiving a message, now relaying it.
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, Starfleet reports our last six crew members ready to beam up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly he's relaxed again; he rises.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? I'll see that he beams up...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
And he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia in hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<SULU>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then understands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ilia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your pre-programming is already set in, Lieutenant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<DIRECTION>
Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS, "It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..." Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature -- now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly, repeats:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister Sulu. That makes me as safe as any human female.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has moved in beside Ilia.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes on console)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can assure him that's true, can't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly, the remark carries special, personal significance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the Transporter Chamber. Kirk calls through intercom to the last arrival, a young female Yeoman.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeoman, what was the problem down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<YEOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(through intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He insisted we go first, sir. Said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules.

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Yeoman

	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE CHAMBER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment, then again the GENERATING HUMMING, and then the familiar BEAMING EFFECT. And then you SEE McCOY! He fully MATERIALIZES. He looks himself over as if in pleased surprise he is still in one piece. CAMERA PANS McCoy from the Transporter Chamber to Kirk who is hav- ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(flat, tight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, Captain, sir, was that your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little known -- and seldom used -- reserve activation clause...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in simpler language, Captain, sir, they drafted me!

</McCOY>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(straight-faced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring:
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was your idea! It was your idea, wasn't it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bones, there's a 'thing' out there --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Why is any object we don't understand called a 'thing'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- headed this way. I need you...

<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bones, I need you badly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk extends his hand again; McCoy delays some moments -- then finally responds. And once done, it is the long hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their differences. Now McCoy turns to Rand.
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Permission to come aboard, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<RAND>
<DIRECTION>
(elated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Permission granted, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAND>
<DIRECTION>
And McCoy moves toward the door, grumbling:
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear Chapel's an MD now; I need a top nurse, not a doctor who'll argue every diagnosis... And --
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails after him.
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... they've probably redesigned sickbay, too. Engineers love to change things.
	</DIALOGUE>

as the starship's photon torpedo tubes EJECT GLOWING BALLS OF LIGHT ENERGY, which seems to float toward the oncoming asteroid, almost too slowly. And in these brief seconds, the asteroid hurtles at the Enterprise, the huge pitted rock growing even larger than the ship itself. It FILLS THE SCREEN, as the photon torpedoes hit, disintegrating the asteroid into thousands of fragments. Instantly, these fragments pulverize them- selves on the ship's forward forcefield and deflector screens. The smaller pieces burn up on impact, clearly outlining the ship's forcefield barriers.

Kirk seeming to collect his thoughts now -- he gives Decker a look, uses the intercom himself:

as Kirk flips off the intercom, rises determinedly, faces Decker:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Decker, I'd like to see you in my quarters.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I tag along?

Kirk gives McCoy an annoyed look, then strides to the elevator. Decker, grim, follows -- McCoy brings up the rear as they EXIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS

<DIRECTION>
The doors opening, Kirk entering, McCoy moves to b.g. while Decker stands attentively, waiting as Kirk turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cool, polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight- ly chagrined. After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you acted properly, of course.

</KIRK>
<DECKER>

	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.

Kirk reacts with anger. Struggles for and regains control.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, I'll do that.

Kirk peers at Decker, who stands facing him determinedly.

(whirling at McCoy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Doctor?

Kirk's last line has drowned out Decker's "Aye, sir." McCoy says nothing, waits until Decker is gone and the door closes behind him. Then:

</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point, Captain, is that it's you who's competing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, as Kirk reacts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You pulled every string in the book short of blackmail to get the Enterprise -- maybe even that. And when this mission is over, you have no intention of giving her back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(tight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an obsession -- that can blind you so far more immediate -- and critical responsibilities. Your reaction to Decker is an example.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kirk studies him a beat; has McCoy touched a nerve? Something Kirk himself might have been unaware of? Kirk starts speaking, but is interrupted by:

<DIRECTION>
At his VOICE COMMAND, the viewer comes on with AN IMAGE of Uhura at her console.

On the viewer, Chekov's IMAGE replaces Uhura.

<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.

</CHEKOV>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Viewer IMAGE FADES. Kirk turns back to McCoy whose question of Kirk's fitness still hangs there between them. Eye to eye - then, finally:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your... opinion has been noted, Doctor.

Kirk nods, exits. McCoy watches him go, hoping his point has gotten through.

About the size of a fighter airplane floating in over the vastness of an aircraft carrier. The shuttle slows further, hovering now. Then its fuselage pod detaches from the warp drive nacelles -- the pod moving slowly but precisely toward the starship's command airlock.

<DIRECTION>
INT. POD HATCH ENTRY AREA

<DIRECTION>
as we HEAR the CLANK and WHOOSH of the AIRLOCK MECHAN- ISM. Chekov is standing by with a security man.

A moment later the hatch slips open - TO REVEAL Spock. A proud Spock, impassively Vulcan, almost contemptuously aloof. His hair is now trimmed in neat Vulcan style; he wears Vulcan attire simple, civilian, utilitarian.)

INT. BRIDGE

The elevator doors open, and there is Spock. It takes everyone a moment to believe their eyes. Then, the Bridge crew AD LIB their surprise and pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock...! Spock, where...how...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk, smiling, is moving toward Spock with hand out- stretched. But Spock has already turned and moved toward the science console where Decker sits.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commander, if I may...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
AT SCIENCE CONSOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Decker a moment to realize that Spock wants to take over the console. He begins getting to his feet, throwing Kirk a look. But Kirk's attention is totally on SPOCK. And Spock is already intent on com- putations he is beginning to punch into the science console computer.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been monitoring your Starfleet transmissions, Captain, your engine design difficulties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock continues to punch information into the science computer -- a monitor screen IMAGE begins to show com- plex equations which Spock inspects -- he makes a further computer punch out and inspects a second monitor IMAGE of other equations. Only then does Spock seem to become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with questioning expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I offer my services as Science Officer.

Kirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off his face as he turns to Decker.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE TO INCLUDE ELEVATOR DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they SNAP open -- McCoy and Chapel appear. Chapel sees Spock at the science console -- she moves in quickly, overjoyed. Even McCoy seems pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Spock...!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So help me, I'm actually pleased to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
But as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel stops, stands dumbfounded. Spock gives McCoy a similar glance - turns back to his console readings as:
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how we all feel, Mister...
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
The same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid- sentence. Several grins directed toward Spock are now fading from bridge crew faces. Spock has turned back again for a last quick reading at the console and now stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks coolly, unemotionally to Kirk:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With your permission, I will now discuss these fuel equations with the Engineer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at Spock's strange manner. Spock heads for the elevator -- puz- zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. Then Kirk calls after him, very sincerely:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Spock, welcome aboard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock continues onto the elevator without any acknow- ledgment, leaves. Kirk glances, perplexed, at McCoy. McCoy, equally perplexed, shrugs.

Where, first, CAMERA SHOOTS THROUGH THE WINDOW, the myriad of stars, space, the whole magnificent vista. In the lounge, empty but for them, are Kirk and McCoy -- obviously awaiting Spock, who ENTERS and presents himself cold and aloof as before:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reporting as ordered, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, please.

Spock remains standing, addresses Kirk:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.

<KIRK>

<DIRECTION>
(indicating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down!

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant, it looks like Spock will refuse. Then, he complies but sits formally, rigidly. He ignores McCoy totally.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(still formally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance with McCoy, then:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also -- there was nothing in your report about why you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.

Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless, his expression shifts slightly. McCoy indicates this:

<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That flicker of emotion confirms our guess. You failed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And now, anger, Spock?

Spock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com- posed to almost total blankness.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I still contain fragments of my human half.

The bridge lights go out.

In the sudden darkness, the main viewer is all at once a frantic, furious, pattern of GREEN-WHITE FLARING ENERGY, accompanied by an EXPLOSIVE SHRILLING SOUND. It seems to cling to the forcefields, the incredible energy of the forcefield barriers.

The BLINDING LIGHT FADES and in its lace we SEE a strange "entity" shocking us with its frightening appearance and its ugly-sounding THROBBING HUM of power. It is about seven feet tall and resembles a "blob" of raw energy in shifting patterns and colors of deep, ugly hues of upper spectrum violet. Yet, it looks strangely alive. At the end of the "tendril" (of light) is an "eye" (a small multi-colored device)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREW REACTIONS -- ELEVATORS IN B.G. (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bridge crew reacting hard, shocked and shaken -- the THROBBING SOUND of the Alien thing intensifies as it begins to move across the bridge. Suddenly, in b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two SECURITY MEN burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn. Chekov shouts warningly at the Men:
</DIRECTION>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No weapons...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEKOV>
<DIRECTION>
But Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES -- the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW (of implosion). Second Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - THE SECURITY MEN (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PURPLE GLOW FADES, the First Security Man has simply vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch and the COMPUTER-VOICE ("Intruder Alert") goes OFF. At the same time Chekov speaks into his intercom:
</DIRECTION>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Security... do not send further teams!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEKOV>
<DIRECTION>
The Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the various consoles on the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement, the tendril-head seeming to enter into the console affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument lights there come ON as if the Probe is "reading" each console function. The crew carefully stays clear of the tendrils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEKOV>

as the "probe" withdraws an energy-tendril from one bridge station and "inserts" it into another console.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one interfere...! It doesn't seem interested in us -- only the ship...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk's words are never completed as suddenly all the energy tendrils withdraw from all consoles and a larger, more powerful-looking tendril lashes out, snaking into the science console complex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON SCIENCE CONSOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where, also immediately, all the console and computer lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- There is an incredibly fast EXCHANGE OF HIGH-PITCHED BEES -- the computer obviously in unauthorized commu- nication with the probe!
</DIRECTION>

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
As Decker moves to the main power control, Spock now steps in, his Vulcan strength easily brushing Kirk and Decker aside. Spock clasps his fists above his head, brings it down in a SHATTERING BLOW on the console. It splits open! As the bridge lights dim even more, and as the science console shorts itself out -- and off, Decker confronts Spock:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could have cut it off at the main computer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This served the purpose.

Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now turns abruptly, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Spock, in stepping back, accidentally brushes the probe's energy tendril -- a FLASH OF LIGHT at the contact point sends Spock sinning under the rail and to the floor near Ilia. The probe's energy-tendril has withdrawn from the darkened science console, hov- ers high over the dazed Spock as if angrily seeking the reason for the break in its computer contact. Spock starts to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Spock, don't move...!

</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Decker steps toward her, AD LIBBING a grim "Ilia...!" But he has no chance as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON ILIA (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Probe hovers over her, its whole mass seemingly about to envelope her with a single tendril extended toward her, somehow freezing her into immobility - and then the entire Probe DISSOLVES IN A BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE, obscuring Ilia. Almost instantly the WHITE FLASH FADES -- but Ilia has vanished -- her tricorder clattering to the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
And almost at the same moment a new BRIDGE ALARM SIGNAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ALARM still sounding as from the giant alien ves- sel, we SEE STRANGE, OPAQUE ENERGY PATTERNS STREAKING TOWARD US. Kirk vaults to the command chair, lunges for controls, as Decker races to the weapons-defense console.

Appropriate ALARM KLAXONS, and COMPUTER VOICES begin SOUNDING, and all this is lost in a SUDDEN SHRILLING SOUND (a constant, high-pitched tone). For a moment the energy patterns are prominent on the viewer -- and then the PATTERNS VANISHED and the SHRILL SOUND FADES -- and:

as Difalco arrives on the run, and Decker AD LIBS to her, "Assume Navigator's station, Chief...!" Difalco, bewildered, wants to ask what happened, but no time, and she quickly sits at the post, begins orienting herself. Meanwhile, Decker has begun an Executive Officer's bridge circuit, assisting with various con- soles. Kirk is glancing toward Spock who continues concentrating on the Viewer, striving to comprehend the myriad of thoughts he is sensing from he Aliens. McCoy also arrives on the bridge, takes in the chaotic scene, watches the Viewer grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ENTERPRISE AND V'GER (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the forward end of the giant, an odd-shapped "iris" begins opening menacingly. And it is frighteningly obvious that the tractor beam is pulling the Enterprise to the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
showing the unusual "iris" now almost fully open as Enterprise is drawn closer, closer -- through the "iris" we now SEE (some of) V'ger's interior: a dark void relieved only by strange flickering glows of dis- tant ENERGY FIELD PATTERNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew reacts with understandable awe, apprehension, curiosity, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, suggest a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam might weaken it just enough for us to break free --
	</DIALOGUE>

All face the Viewer again, react, with McCoy who has been observing all these reactions now galvanized into action:

Kirk staring at the viewer -- the "iris" now fully open so that the exterior of V'ger is no longer visible -- and all we can SEE is the monstrous void dead ahead, which is looming faster and larger before our eyes. And now we are inside.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ENTERPRISE AND V'GER - AT THE "IRIS" (S)

<DIRECTION>
Enterprise now being pulled past the opening -- into the ship proper. Now we can SEE that the dark void is actually a vast chamber, dimly and intermittently lit by POWERFIELDS appearing and vanishing along the vessel's inner walls, which are miles away in the distance. And here and there in the chamber gigantic ENERGY DISPLAYS erupt briefly with a certain symmetry that suggests they must be part of V'ger's ower or control systems.

Kirk's eyes cannot believe what he is seeing:

The HUMMING SOUND just now reaching a gentle crescendo -- through the translucent door you can see COLORS ENVELOPING "ILIA'S" FORM. And now the SOUND STOPS. "Ilia", attired in a leisure robe, steps from the stall, into the room. She stands facing Kirk, her face impas- sive, eyes unblinking. He looks her back a moment, then glances at Spock, who is gazing at "Ilia" in abso- lute fascination. Kirk addresses her:

At the sight of 'Ilia", McCoy's words die in his throat -- and his trained eyes have instantly told him some- thing is awry. He unslings his tricorder, aims the sensor unit at "Ilia". As he reads his instruments, his face reveals the results (incredulity, fascination). Meanwhile, from the start:

<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get her to sickbay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
And he grasps "Ilia's" arm to escort her. But is as though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's" remaining sta- tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am programmed to observe and record normal functioning procedures of the carbon-based units.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then Kirk quickly responds to "Ilia":
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The examination is a normal function.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>

CLOSE SHOT OF EXAMINING ROOM VIEWER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scanning a "body". PULL BACK TO SHOW McCoy, Chapel, Kirk, Spock and Chekov -- standing over "ILIA" who lies prone on the table, the physicians moving the scanner over her.
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

In the b.g., Decker enters, grimly observes the proceed- ings.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And every exocrine system is here, too --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<DIRECTION>
Chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing "Ilia" is peering intently -- almost with a glimmer of recognition -- at Decker. Slightly disconcerted, Chapel continues:

	Deck -- er.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
FAVORING SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as everyone reacts to "Ilia's" utterance of Decker's name. It seems to make the deepest impression on Spock, confirming something he has suspected.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(to "Ilia")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" continues peering at Decker with just a hint of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition. It's the first time we've seen her expression look anything but cool and bland. This results in the quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCoy's examination now turns "Ilia" away from the others. Spock quickly catches Kirk's and Decker's attention, indicates an adjoining door -- they fol- low him out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. McCOY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kirk, Spock and Decker enter, the door snapping shut -- and Spock touching the electronic lock to secure them. He faces the others:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a programmed mechanism, Mr. Spock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.

	They had a pattern to follow...

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock and Kirk are both turning their attention to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Decker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that killed Ilia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commander, we're locked in an alien vessel, six hours from Earth orbit, our only contact with our captors is the probe. If we can control it, persuade it, use it in some way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Interrupted by the SOUND of someone trying to open the locked door behind them. Then a METAL RIPPING SOUND as they whirl to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDICAL OFFICE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with the METAL BUCKLING, TEARING -- and a single hand slicing the steel door like paper. It is the "Ilia" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her whole manner incongruously benign. (Behind her, a startled McCoy, Chapel and Chekov.) "Ilia" speaks flatly, blandly.
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have recorded enough here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(motions to Kirk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will now assist me further.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Decker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Decker-unit can assist you with much greater efficiency...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" has seemed about to object -- but now her eyes hold on Decker. Then she nods.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS DECKER TO THE SMASHED DOOR (AND "ILIA")
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Decker looks at "Ilia" who stands at the torn door. You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade that?! He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him. Decker nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" and a reluctant Decker EXIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMPHASIZING SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking very troubled as they watch Decker and "Ilia" leave. Kirk notices.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock? Concerned about his chances?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.

</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock EXITS.

<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
floating in the vast, eerie, alien chamber -- sporadic FLASHES OF ENERGY, erupting now and then. Various other EFFECTS. OVER this, Kirk's VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain's Log. Stardate 7414.1. Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth. No significant Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe. This remains our only means of contact with our captor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTERPRISE AIRLOCK AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The area dimly lit -- unoccupied but for a lone AIRLOCK TECHNICIAN checking and adjusting instruments. The CAMERA MOVES PAST him to FIND:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention. Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant has applied a Vulcan nerve pinch. The Tech slumps over his console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KIRK'S CABIN - VIEWER MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Showing a CLOSE SHOT of ENTERPRISE PICTURES, then PULL BACK SLIGHTLY for an IMAGE of Decker and "Ilia" walk- ing through the Rec Deck. PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW Kirk watching this -- and with him is McCoy. They continue watching a troubled beat, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(of pictures)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All these vessels were called "Enterprise".
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" is giving the pictures a very interested look as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin:
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA_S_INTERCOM_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(controlled excitement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridge to Captain...

</UHURA_S_INTERCOM_VOICE>

INT. BRIDGE - UHURA'S STATION (SCIENCE STATION IN B.G.)

<KIRK_S_INTERCOM_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirk here.

</KIRK_S_INTERCOM_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., Spock's station a MAINTENANCE TEAM is replacing the broken Science Station computer. (Spock is conspicuously absent.)
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A faint signal from Starfleet, sir. They have the intruder on their monitors...

</KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECREATION DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker and "Ilia", the Rec Deck unoccupied but for a pair of wary SECURITY GUARDS at a very discreet dis- tance. They are near the pictures of the five Enter- prises, which should be FEATURED in this SHOT, as Decker waves his hand about the huge room.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The carbon units use this area for recreation...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What type of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER TWO SHOT (PICTURES O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As "Ilia" moves on into the room, Decker follows:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy' have no meaning to my programming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration -- and no little pain, for she is after all the exact replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images to V'ger) the sights. They are near a game area (elec- tronic games), and now Decker points to one game, switches it on -- presses button to activate its LIGHTS and SOUNDS. "Ilia" watches interestedly as Decker operates the game.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she nearly always won --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
And he demonstrates again, as "Ilia" steps to the device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KIRK'S CABIN - GROUP WATCHING THE MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCoy watching with special interest:
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(approving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! He's using audial-visual association.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia" says:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This device serves no purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment is evident. So is everyone elses.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(nods grimly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She needs something else: something much more personal to stimulate memory patterns. Something with a more emotional tie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk reacts to this, reflective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REC DECK FULL ON DECKER AND "ILIA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker waving back toward the general area of the Enterprise pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(hoping he's struck a responsive chord)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(controlling surprise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck objects. Decker moves with her; then:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS "ILIA" TO DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping; almost pleasantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for him to thank her. He thinks fast now.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is logical. You may procede.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
ON DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will suffer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE (M)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship stationary in the chamber as now we SEE an exterior hatch sliding fully open. Up through the hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under the Enterprise saucer section. In this and subsequent VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit. (By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position even from several miles away.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON THE SPACESUITED FIGURE (M)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his face set in the same grim, determined expression, as he touches his spacesuit transmitter control.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Computer, commence recording. Captain Kirk -- this message will detail my attempt to contact the aliens...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk ENTERING, crossing Uhura as she calls:
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(listening intently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<SULU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<CHEKOV>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEKOV>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(reacts knowingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to navigator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a fix on his position!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - MED. ON SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His features now set into an almost trance-like expres- sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations. Then we SEE his head turn, he peers off -- then he moves his thruster controls. We SEE the small blue jets of his thrusters -- his spacesuit figure begins to move off in the direction he was concentrating upon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His thrusters moving him across V'ger's vast chamber then dropping down into a deep "trough"-like area which stretches into the distance ahead of him. A cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS (Kirk's entrapment) become visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis- tance and does not attract them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall of the trough toward which Spock is heading. It is an unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance. (Here, also, we will become aware of "sensor-bee" swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall from all points of the chamber.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRLOCK AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOWING Kirk in a thruster spacesuit, helmet being readied by AIRLOCK TECHNICIANS. McCoy is also here, arguing with Kirk:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(from the start)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I don't want him stopped, Bones; I want him to lead me to whatever's out there...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if that 'whatever' has taken over his mind....?
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he'll have still led me to it, won't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
And Kirk steps into the airlock door, hits a control -- it begins sliding closed behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP THROUGH the circular airlock door as it slides open -- and Kirk's tiny spacesuited figure floats down clear of the saucer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEEING his face through the spacesuit faceplate as he scans the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<SULU_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridge, Captain. We make Spock as 26 Mark 345 degrees off ship's axis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
During which, Kirk spots something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock's STROBE blinker at a mile or so distance, nearing V'ger's inner walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have him in sight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
During which, Kirk touches his thruster controls and blue thruster jet propels him off in the direction indicated. His thrusters come on for a longer period of time as he accelerates to the higher speed necessary to overtake Spock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ILIA'S QUARTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR SNAPPING open, and "Ilia", McCoy and Decker entering. Then CAMERA REVEALS Chapel already inside, looking through some female adornments she's found there.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember Lt. Ilia once mentioning that she wore this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(reacting; tight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... when we met.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly this is very painful to Decker. Meanwhile, Chapel hands the Deltan headband to "Ilia".
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPEL>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" hasn't the slightest idea what to do with the headband, holds it, runs her fingers over the jewels and feathers embedded into it. Chapel takes it from her, places it on 'Ilia's" head, now switches on the light illuminating the dressing table mirror -- stands behind her with Decker, both watching apprehensively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON "ILIA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
studying her image in the mirror, her face totally blank a moment, but then breaking into a bemused frown -- as though trying to remember. And:
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPEL>
<DIRECTION>
(helpfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet; urging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On Delta... remember...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
And it seems that "Ilia" does remember. She peers at her image, then sets the headband into its exact proper position. Then she turns and looks at them with recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(haltingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Chapel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS CHAPEL TO DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who stares at "Ilia" nonplussed. This is Ilia coming alive!
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Decker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Will..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
And she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it, and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words and looks to McCoy for some kind of help. McCoy realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(gently reminding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commander... this is a mechanism...
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he should do:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(gently; but urgingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilia, help us make direct contact with V'ger...
	</DIALOGUE>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... cannot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Decker looks at "Ilia's" hand still resting on his. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then tell us who V'ger is; where he's from... W need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
For another moment "Ilia" continues smiling at Decker, holding his hand. Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes -- the hand is released. Clearly, she's again the probe, as:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why have two carbon units entered V'ger...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost imperceptibly: he doesn't know. But Decker has an obvious reply:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want to make contact with V'ger...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to revive
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Ilia's" memory again;
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
touches her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing;
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	distressed,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
to "Ilia")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their purpose is to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is also V'ger's purpose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Decker's face reflects his bemusement:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is how V'ger will survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
ON DECKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest enlightenment.
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - KIRK MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench as he continues forward progress in the direction he saw Spock taking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So we can SEE his face (through the plate), as he looks ahead into the distance toward Spock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK'S POV (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock's STROBE signal closer and Spock's tiny space- suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves steadily toward the GLOWING FORCEFIELDS of the inner wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His attention fixed on Spock, he never notices until an instant too late an O.S. object; quickly he hits a thruster control, and we SEE the MANEUVERING JET turn him to the side as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE - KIRK AND THE BLOB FORMATION (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A swarm of strange-looking translucent crystal-like FORMS on a collision course with Kirk. (NOTE: They were traveling randomly, and are not deliberate ob- structions. However, Kirk's nearness now has attracted them and the swarm of them heads in his direction. Kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second MANEUVERING JET -- but he overcompensates, and spins straight into the intercepting swarm of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - KIRK (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the nearest crystal forms WHIP INTO SHOT, adhering to Kirk's spacesuit. He hits full MANEUVERING JETS now, seems to make some escape, but still more forms WHIP IN, adhere.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>

</KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sulu hits the viewer magnification control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE TO MAIN VIEWER (M)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the distant STROBE FLASHES of Kirk's spacesuit are MAGNIFIED CLOSER, pulling Kirk into MEDIUM LONG SHOT. We can SEE the details of the swarm of forms adhering. But we can SEE that Kirk's spacesuit is now about half covered with them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Expressions of bridge crew to reflect the horror of what they're seeing as:
</DIRECTION>

	Mr. Spock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<DIRECTION>
Looks of distress are exchanged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock's spacesuited figure MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA, as we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(weak; STATIC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Spock...! ... need help...! ... trapped...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
No indication at first that Spock has heard; his face set with determination, his eyes fixed on his destin- ation: the inner wall.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; weakening; STATIC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... pressure on me...! ... can't move...! Spock...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ON SPOCK - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously. Spock's expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall, then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the way he came from. But he cannot resist Kirk's call; he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS FLARE, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE - SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as thruster JETS accelerate him back toward Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (M)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
showing Kirk's spacesuit completely covered, encased in the blob. Kirk is no longer moving. But in the distance, facing toward him is Spock!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with Spock in the near distance, heading TOWARD the CAMERA. As he approaches Kirk, Spock brings out his phaser. Now he hits the controls for the REVERSE JETS -- he slows RAPIDLY as he approaches Kirk's now complete- ly encased spacesuit. Spock makes a quick phaser adjustment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SPOCK AND KIRK'S ENCASED SPACESUIT (O) (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock levels the phaser carefully. FIRES. The PHASER BEAM strikes the blob form -- it SHATTERS, the pieces DISINTEGRATING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - SPOCK AND KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
facing each other while hovering in space.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridge, cancel rescue teams.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!

</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am seeking answers, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(with insight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your personal one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock does not immediately reply, peers at Kirk through the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away, points off into the distance:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance, then disappearing there. (We'll SEE other swarms occasionally too, coming from different directions -- they will later be identified as "sensor swarms" on closer examination.)
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, I believe there we will find an indication of whoever -- or whatever -- is aboard this vessel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster controls and begins moving in the direction Spock indicated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the point on the inner wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - AT INNER WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The most prominent area of the vast inner wall -- the patterns on the wall here seem to GLOW with life. The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE, gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central part of theses patterns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON KIRK AND SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless. Then Spock sees something, indicates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG ANGLE TO INCLUDE SENSOR SWARM (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, we SEE that they are tiny, multi-colored points of FLASHING LIGHT -- almost like swarms of bees. They approach the inner wall at this central point and seem to "disappear" through the orifice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK AND SPOCK - ANOTHER "SWARM" APPROACHING (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This "sensor swarm" has been coming from a direction that will take them close past Kirk and Spock. Then, as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs. He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON KIRK AND SPOCK (AGAINST "TUBE" WALL)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something with his fingers. He brings it up to Kirk's face mask -- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it tries to escape from Spock's fingers. And in this CLOSE VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's throat hollow. Then Spock releases it and it darts to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK AND SPOCK'S POV (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From this closer distance, we SEE that an opening ap- pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk and Spock exchange a look. Their thruster JETS ignite briefly, moving them in that direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their movements to coincide with the arrival of another "swarm" -- the wall begins OPENING. The "swarm" through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and Kirk slip in before it closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "MEMORY CAVE" - SPOCK AND KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside. But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE (M)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long "cave" chamber with its row of huge MEDIATOR BALLS extending into the distance. To one side, the gleaming CRYSTAL MEMORY WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK AND SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what they are seeing. Then, he takes out his tricorder again, propels himself toward the memory crystals. Kirk follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT MEMORY CRYSTAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(nods; indicates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be shinier, more pulsating than the others): ANOTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAPID PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES, but this time including a pattern-like image of Klingons, Klingon vessels (the ones destroyed by the Cloud), and obvious Starfleet personnel -- and the Epsilon 9 station. Also, a pattern of the Security Guard killed by the probe. And Ilia.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(agreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall, consulting his tricorder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THEM TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock inspecting this area at which the "newer" crystals are PULSATING and GLOWING, and which appears to be a termination of the Crystal area, continuing on and dis- appearing through the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, I do not believe there is a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am almost certain now that all of this is V'ger -- I believe that we are inside a life form, a living machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to- ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di- rection. Then a glance to Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must attempt mindmeld with it, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(warningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock reaching the Ball, halts his momentum and removes one gauntlet, baring his hand. Stretching the bare hand toward a part of it which looks strangely "alive." The very power generated from this area is clearly affecting Spock's hand. Meanwhile, Kirk has used his THRUSTERS to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock, if you're right, its mind may be enormous...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
But Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the "alive" area -- the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he forces his hand toward that surface, closer, closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching, almost mesmerized. Torn between wanting to pull Spock away from the wall -- and knowing that Spock must go through with it. For everyone's sake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the "liv- ing area," the invisible force even stronger -- but Spock's strength unwavering, and now he touches the surface -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the touch. And at the same moment Spock' body convulses as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are charging through him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SPOCK'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth open -- he SCREAMS. CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF SPOCK'S EYES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA ZOOM - THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES (per Con Pederson discussion). Symbolizing V'ger's incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge, these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules, galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human knowledge or comprehension. It takes only fifteen or twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO :
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISPENSARY - SPOCK'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA BRIDGING BACK OUT THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES AND INTO ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings. Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical scanner over the brain area.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCoy at a console, watching readings he is getting from Chapel's scanner. Kirk watches McCoy anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indications of some neurological trauma--the power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering...
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Before Kirk can reply, they HEAR a LAUGH! An abrupt, harsh, bitter laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THEM TO SICKBAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously Spock who has just laughed -- but there is no indication of laughter from him now. A startled Chapel has stepped back away from the bed. Spock seems to be attempting to focus, orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the bedside.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(quiet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised Kirk's hand in his. McCoy exchanges a surprised glance with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend- ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This simple feeling...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Kirk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... is so far beyond V'ger's comprehension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with Kirk and McCoy exchanging another surprised glance (at Spock's emotion), with McCoy gesturing Kirk not to question it.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A living machine...?!

<DIRECTION>
(to Chapel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're living machines, too: protein mechanisms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk nods at McCoy.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it considers the Enterprise a living machine: that's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<CHAPEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it thinks our ship is alive what does it think we are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPEL>
<McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An 'infestation' -- bacteria... microbes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Spock turns to Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw V'ger's planet: a planet populated by living machines. Unbelievable technology.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger has knowledge that spans this universe. And... in all this order... all this magnificence, V'ger feels no awe...no delight... no beauty...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; exhausted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have known...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too weak.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what, Spock? What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
But Spock falls back, exhausted -- and McCoy gently tugs at Kirk, AD-LIBBING, "Let him rest, Jim..." Kirk shrugs McCoy away, addresses Spock:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What should you have known?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No meaning... No hope...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for answers itself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What answers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL:
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A faint signal from Starfleet, sir! Intruder Cloud has been located on their outer monitors for past twenty-seven minutes... dissipating rapidly as it approaches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, Sulu's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<SULU_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed! We are three minutes from Earth's orbit!-

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right there...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need Spock on the bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Chapel urns to a MED TECH, AD LIBS an order, "Dalaphaline, twenty cc's..." As the Tech quickly sets the hypo-injector, and hands it to Chapel - and she injects Spock, the hypo emitting a fast, QUIET HISS -- Kirk gazes at Spock just an instant as Spock breathes deeply, the drug clearly strengthening him. Chapel and the Tech help Spock from the bed, as Kirk addresses McCoy:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A machine planet...? Sending a machine to Earth looking for its Creator...?

</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God.

</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk looks at him, then at Spock -- on his feet now -- then at McCoy again:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'To find the Creator,' the probe said. Find God...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kirk stands facing him another moment, then whirls and steps to the monitor, flips some buttons, and peaks into his communicator.

ENGINEERING

<DIRECTION>
SHOWING Scott (at his console) listening to Kirk's words -- and facing Decker and "Ilia" who are just about to leave Engineering. (In b.g. the Engine core GLOWS the appropriate color, and there is a SOFT HUM of IDLE POWER.) Kirk's VOICE continues:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(amplified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a living entity...! A machine life form. We are attempting to ascertain its intentions. All personnel will maintain yellow alert status!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON DECKER AND "ILIA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The probe bland as usual, but Kirk's words seem to have strangely elated Decker; he says to her:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By whom...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>

just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open disapproval.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, now what about all that? A living entity, the Captain says... entity... A living thing...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia," attempting to digest what she's just said. But quickly:
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Scotty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(dourly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your welcome, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz- ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every move. Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns and looks back at the engine room. She addresses Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no logical reason for carbon units to control Enterprise's power systems.

As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN. (Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference some-times seen on the television screen.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavy interference, sir -- it's coming from here, inside the intruder itself...

Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from his console, listens to it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.

Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but Uhura interrupts:

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from V'ger. It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA- ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in different direction.)

<ILIA>

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.

ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INCLUDING CHEKOV (O)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions, growing smaller in the distance. The fourth object is holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep meditation. Kirk turns and takes "Ilia's" shoulders and carefully turns her to face him.
</DIRECTION>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course: we all create God in our own image.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought. Then he addresses "Ilia" again, this time with emotion: after all, he is pleading for the survival of the entire planet:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger! If we are lesser beings, we are still, like you, living. And because we are alive, we -- like you -- wish to survive. You must not destroy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk pauses abruptly: "Ilia" is regarding him blandly, stonily -- not the slightest reaction or response; clearly Kirk's plea is being ignored. Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the futility, turns helplessly to Spock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who has been listening intently, with near fascination -- an idea forming in his mind. Quickly, he steps down to Kirk:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Needing what...?

	Spock, this 'child' is about to eliminate all life on Earth; how do we teach it that that's 'wrong'? With a spanking...!?

</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to Decker.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't know what it needs, Comm ander...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kirk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does not know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a reaction; then Kirk glances at "Ilia" -- his brain is racing, struggling to reach a decision. And then:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilia... we can help V'ger find what it needs --

"Ilia" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns to Kirk:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kirk, hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disclose the information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<KIRK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.

</KIRK>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!

</ILIA>

Kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his bet:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(to "Ilia," almost pleasant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to crew commandingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
A moment where all are startled at this order -- but no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within V'ger.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>

(amplified)
</DIRECTION>

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.

Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE

as all react to the powerful blasts, holding on to railings, etc, at the same time attempting to secure their stations for the evacuation. The DAMAGE REPAIR TECHNICIAN leaves his station, crossing to exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DAMAGE_TECH>
<DIRECTION>
(leaving bridge; to Captain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Severe stress on engine pylons, sir.

<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kirk; flat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger requires the information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>

Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridge secure all stations! Move out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Decker has crossed to Chekov's now abandoned console, checks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turning to confront "Ilia":
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If V'ger destroys the Enterprise, the information V'ger requires will also be destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
INCLUDING VIEWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes, and simul- taneously the ROCKING CEASES. At the same time, "Ilia" is saying:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is illogical to withhold required information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe the withdrawing crew. Most are out; only Spock, Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his way. The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights are dimmed even further:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(almost polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirk-unit, why do you not disclose information?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have repressed the Creator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The information will not be disclosed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts toward the bridge elevator. "Ilia" calls after him:
</DIRECTION>
<ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a plea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger needs the information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE ELEVATORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just behind -- all stopping abruptly now at "Ilia's" state- ment. The very tone of her voice is enough for them to realize they have made a very telling point. Kirk follows fast:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<ILIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.

</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON McCOY

<DIRECTION>
wryly reacting to this:

<McCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It learns fast, doesn't it...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCOY>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey- ing the obvious question: "What the hell do we do now?" But Spock is ready with an answer:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, the vessel -- V'ger -- obviously operates from a central brain complex...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this idea has an even greater significance.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Spock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precisely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk nods grimly, faces "Ilia" again; this time he's playing for all the stakes.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The carbon units' information cannot be disclosed to V'ger's probe... only to V'ger directly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia" who seems momentarily in some internal communication.

She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at the Main Viewer.

the image of the chamber in which the Enterprise is imprisoned. But now, toward the chamber-end, where further passage had previously been barred by the lace- work energy barriers -- an OPENING APPEARS. And at the same time there is a GENTLE LURCHING EFFECT, and:

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>

moving through the chamber, pulled by the invisible tractor beam, toward the OPENING -- toward the next chamber which, from this POV seems even larger, more forbidding.

INT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the four officers step down onto the bridge, Spock hurrying to his science station, Kirk to the center seat.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Resume duty stations, Mr. Decker.

<DIRECTION>
As Kirk attends to his console, Deck is at an intercom:

<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(into intercom, voice amplified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All personnel resume stations...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time the lights are brightening -- and members of the bridge crew begin returning. All this time there is an ever increasing sense of movement. Kirk glances at Decker:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.

<DIRECTION>
(slight smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's the only game in town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk reacts, pleased, a split beat at Decker's "our" hand, and goes on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk throws him a look of appreciation, then, abruptly his manner changes as he addresses Chekov:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?

</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - KIRK WITH AN ANGLE ON SPOCK

(into intercom, eyes on "Ilia")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute Starfleet order two zero zero five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing this, Spock whirls around -- peers incredulously at Kirk. He appears for a moment to be incensed at Kirk's words. Then he realizes and understands Kirk's position and turns, sadly resigned, back to his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENGINEERING
</DIRECTION>

as Scott, too, hears this, but his reaction is of grim acceptance. Not so Chief Ross; she is horrified.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, sir.

And Scott hits buttons on his console, now moves to step from his station, nearly collides with Ross, who clearly is bravely struggling to maintain her poise and dignity:
</DIRECTION>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why has the Captain ordered self- destruct, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would say, lass, because he thinks -- he hopes -- that when we go up... we'll take V'ger with us.

</SCOTT>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>

EXT. ENTERPRISE - INT. V'GER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly more active than anything we have previously seen. Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches powerfields; a tremendous volume of them seem to ema- nate and converge there. The medium from which the ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through it at all. The entire chamber pulses with machine- like, alien life. This should even be evidenced in the booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:

The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being pulled toward the brain complex. All are somewhat sub- dued, for all realize how their journey will end -- but at the same time they also realize there is no other way. The CAMERA PANS, catching facial reactions -- as, in the b.g., we HEAR a constant flow of AD-LIBBED crew comments:

Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted. Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and steps up to:

Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA so we can see now, just under Spock's eye:

A tear! Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek. Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he addresses Spock:

Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's face compassion and understanding, with Decker step- ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:

<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.

</SPOCK>
<SPOCK>

(ALTERNATIVE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each of us, at some time in our life, turns to someone, a father, a brother, a God and asks 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its Creator to find its answers.

This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all ominous, but quite lovely in effect. As the Enterprise continues forward motion, now ahead you will to SEE a small "island." Floating in the exact center of the hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT, with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and COLORS. On the "island," vague at this distance, ap pears to be a "solid" matter form.

The Enterprise approaching the edge of the "island" -- slowing, but still quite clearly being pulled by the tractor beam. The "solid matter" in the "island" cen- ter still obscured by the STRANGE LIGHT GLOW emanating from that area. The Enterprise is now nearly at the "island" edge.

All this has caused Kirk to vacillate, but he still believes his course of action is the proper one, as:-
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The carbon units will now provide V'ger the required information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILIA>
<DIRECTION>
"Ilia" is moving toward the elevator, turning to face the others as she says this. Kirk remains frozen, his hand on the intercom button. He glances at McCoy, as though seeking advice. McCoy peers at him blandly, levelly; Kirk must follow his own instinct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAVORING KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gazing at "Ilia," then at Spock, his brain racing, con- sidering all the possibilities, options. He glances at the anxious faces awaiting his decision: a possible twenty-two more minutes of life -- or instant death. Another beat as he decides. Then:

Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com- pelling about Decker's manner -- a certain sense of absolute necessity. Kirk seems about to deny the re- quest, then turns to Sulu:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Sulu, you have the conn...

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
And Kirk leaves; Decker, his face reflecting a strange, almost eager gratification, hurries after him.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	V'ger plans to literally meld to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
	</DIALOGUE>

<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and then to reassemble itself combined with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND. In the midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much centering on him. He sees "Ilia" watching him with none of their "former navigator" in her expression now. Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our data is being prepared.

Kirk's words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them.

<DECKER>

	We need only a few more minutes. Believe me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet, tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him lying there -- just the slightest softening of her features now.

We SEE Decker look up at Kirk's call, then ignore him and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch. At this moment, from Kirk's communicator, a SIGNAL.

The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and resignation. Then Kirk lifts his communicator again:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Enterprise... transmit.

</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
DECKER AND "ILIA"

catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on his tricorder. Both he and "Ilia" are watching Kirk and the others closely. Now Decker looks down at the tricorder's face. He nods:

<DIRECTION>
KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

<KIRK>

as the others turn to Decker and "Ilia."
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating into hatch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...

	<DIALOGUE>
	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!

Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly as Decker did earlier. Then he looks up, reacts as he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a smile playing on Decker's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACTION ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Kirk suddenly pivots, races toward Decker -- but he passes too close to the "Ilia"-probe. It sends him spinning back, tumbling to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
as KIRK starts up to scramble to his feet but Spock has stepped in, putting a hand on Kirk's shoulder and re straining him.

And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - V'GER TRANSCENDING (S)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker. The color becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through the room. "Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his molecular pattern is expanding. A SPECTACULAR SERIES OF VISUALS., THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER -- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost transparent. And the SPIRALING now expanding in all directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve, vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to slip into the new dimension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk, Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant. Around them, V'ger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL- LIANT, LOVELY PATTERNS. They all turn and race into the complex in the direction of their vessel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EARTH ORBIT - AN ENERGY BOLT (S)

It too seems to be flowering into loveliness, brilliant, graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another dimension, vanishing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. V'GER - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting, graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence into another dimension. And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise.
