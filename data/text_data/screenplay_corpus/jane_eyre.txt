EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes, open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach. She flags it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod indicates she can get in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear the day, she closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door. With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost, alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the gathering dark. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying to calm herself with a prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun. She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She sits up. She is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the stones. Jane makes no movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She eats it ravenously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns, looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the point of despair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her. Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees, she peers through a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women. They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee. They are talking intimately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy that it pains Jane considerably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers. She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch.

Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.

The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and curtains, murky in the fading light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth. Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white. Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror. She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally rips from Jane's throat.

Helen Burns undoes the back of her dress. The punishment is given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs.
</DIRECTION>

Jane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like one in a trance. Jane is deeply affected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two smart, bombastic ladies. Mr Brocklehurst follows. Helen's punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the pedestal of infamy - and you'll remain upon it all day. You'll receive no sustenance and no comfort, for you must learn how barren is the life of the sinner.

EXT. DAY. A FROZEN MEADOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters. The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking, turning the frost gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly, acutely aware of everything around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her feet echoes. She steadies herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if the whole winter is contained in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet. The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments startle both horse and rider.

The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying, trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.

<DIRECTION>
Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands back in a dark corner.

There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist.

Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses. Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction; Blanche. Her lip curls in distaste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class - and of her love. Blanche sidles up to Rochester.

INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A summer gale. The moan of the wind sounds almost human. The light is sickly, nightmarish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great box sits on the table, which Jane is opening. Adele, Sophie and Mrs Fairfax are all looking on. Jane pulls out a pearl coloured wedding gown. She is dismayed at its opulence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds it up to herself. Adele starts to play with the great veil. She wraps it round herself. She becomes caught in it, tangled, distressed.

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 87.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black hair hanging down her back. She is dressed in a nightgown - like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil; a phantom bride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is paralysed with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half; bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly. Her eyes are glittering with hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane. Her intention looks deadly. Jane's breath catches. She cannot breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure moves closer, then blows out the candle. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane wakes, lying half out of the bed. The veil is over her. She flings it away from her face. Jane sits, her terror dawning. Her breath comes in great dry sobs. She is shocked to find herself still alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EVENING. - THORNFIELD - BY THE GATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is waiting, pale with anxiety. A man on horseback approaches, a great dog at his side; Rochester. He is grinning.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rochester, grimly resolute, is striding at a pace Jane can hardly follow. Her satin shoes are muddy. She is becoming breathless. A rook flies over their heads, cawing.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE CHURCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church of ancient design. Jane stumbles. Rochester is contrite.

	This girl knew nothing. She thought all was fair and legal. She never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch.

With shocking speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into Rochester's cheek. He struggles with her.

Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue. Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on her knees, her arms behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Far away, we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the remote mountains. We hear the sound of the torrent approach.

	I was tricked, duped into wedlock with that demon-hate, that harlot, that succubus upstairs. My father wanted her money and so I was sent to Spanish Town and the match was made.

	I used to long for a life of action, to overleap the horizon, to move in the world of men. Maybe God is giving me this. And what is there for me here? Pain and longing for what can't be. I don't know how long I would survive in India. My frame isn't strong. But I'll go with you, if I may go free.

She takes the candelabra from the table. She admires herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers, the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge curtains alight. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 116.

EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE GROUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track. Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars. She walks through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart, brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a hawk. His strength is undiminished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there. He is absolutely still; his expression, serene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is immediately on guard, his expression turning wary. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back. Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears into the dark interior.

Jane starts to breathe again.
