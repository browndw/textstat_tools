<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNSET The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK, ROBED FIGURE A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened, almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer. Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to their devotions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation. Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says you stole his bread.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a lie. I caught him stealing ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The lowlife jabbers some more. The Interrogator debates.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut off the infidel's hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!... I took the bread.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sacrifice for the weaker? How noble... As you wish... Cut off this one's hand as well!... But first...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward. His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show them the courage of Allah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket. Twitching. Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out, forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter catches his eye... Robin winks. The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame. Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is English courage.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword. Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest. Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator. Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the fire. Screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for five years of hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Warned, Robin ducks away. Slams the jailer's head into the wall. Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered. While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN. Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even his bald head is ornamented.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You speak English?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The king's own. Set me free.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Robin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For pity's sake. Mine is a sentence of death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't trust him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Two more guards attack, yelling fury. Robin eyes the curved scimitar.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I would give for an English sword. This is a pruning hook.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A guard swings at him with a giant axe. Robin slashes... shears the axe handle in two.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm! Not bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand. Commotion outside. RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Free me and I will show you a way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should we trust you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't, you are dead men.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He makes a point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The door bursts open. More guards rush in.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He slashes the man free.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robin!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He beckons them to the back. A hidden door leads into a tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWERS - NIGHT They wade through foul water up to their waists. The Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin lops off its head.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are fast, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches. Blocking the way.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will need to be yet faster.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through. Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poison air. Hold your breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it with one mighty twist.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(coughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I misjudged you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save your breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARACEN>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down- ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the walls ahead. Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use. They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways, bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake. Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it works.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allah be praised.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen, brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a grating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears. All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps Peter up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God willing, we may now be safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Peter. We must hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is mortal. Leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on to my shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter shakes him off.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother... my little sister. Tell them I love them. Tell them I died a free Englishman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His wound is by the heart. We cannot save him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this to my sister. Swear you will protect her for me... Swear it, Robin!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For England.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He fells the first Arab. The Saracen pulls Robin away.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come now! Do not fail your friend. Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos- sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DESERTED ALLEY - LATER Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our way is together. With the speed of Allah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He grins. This strange man has a sense of humor.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I go to England.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I go to England.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	England? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved my life. I must stay with you until I save yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only Allah can do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if I don't want you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no choice... unless you think you can kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He grins broadly. Offers his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SARACEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Aslan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND) Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney. SUPERIMPOSE: LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough of that din, Remus. I can't think.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc- tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD LOCKSLEY. Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores over a wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself for solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the vast table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances at a portrait over the fireplace... Robin. The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged, desperate, KENNETH.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Lord! Help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN. Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth back.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must wait... I am sorry you were disturbed, Master.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(high anxiety)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Lord, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is alright, Duncan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kenneth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The peasant falls to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've taken my Gwen. My daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who has taken her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men on horses. In masks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touches his wound)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We tried to stop them. My son is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain him.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot go alone, Master. Let me ride for help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That may be too late. Kenneth, lead the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks his horse into motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master, stay! There is an evil moon tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good will overcome, Duncan. Trust in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Duncan looks up. Crosses himself. Dark clouds race across the moon. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODED TRAIL Kenneth checks the ground. Locksley waits.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They came this way, my Lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Onward then. What is this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nearby the Gregor Caves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on... Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light. Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree. Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out. He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat. Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls, all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night. Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steady, man. They are to dissuade the faint of heart. Think of Gwen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge. A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality. Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Druids.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trusted we were rid of such evil a century ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOCKSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood. The reveler is ecstatic.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(petrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it the devil?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it is, I have some Christian steel that will test his hide.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt. A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his head.
</DIRECTION>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gwen?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth nods. The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who is carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan altar, the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk raised. A masked figure stands at the head of the altar. The high priest of the dark rite. The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, my virgin flower.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move- ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation... A warrior's yell! Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him! Kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The followers throw themselves at Locksley. He beats them off. The high priest issues orders to armed guards, who run to intercept. One aims a spear. Locksley hacks the shaft in half. Cuts men down left and right. Reaches the altar stone.
</DIRECTION>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gwen! Up, girl, up!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
</DIRECTION>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the name of God!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face... Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. The guards close in. Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening. The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path. Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked. Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown. Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nottingham!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard, cruel intensity in every feature.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are an unwelcome surprise, Locksley.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The King shall hear of this, Nottingham.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.
</DIRECTION>
<LOCKSELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God help us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day all England will worship with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never.
	</DIALOGUE>

The crone spits venom in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Mortianna. You will die with my name on your lips.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill- side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five masked figures block his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor. A cross on its sail. A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home. Thank you, Lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land...

<ASLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(SARACEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I love them so dearly, I cannot dishonor them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No man controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin laughs. The Saracen remains intense.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same. Only I would have succeeded.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles broadly. Robin claps him on the shoulder.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASLAN>

EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at them, laughing. Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot, with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing. Searching. GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback. Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony. He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms, FANNY.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe the sheriff three bushels of flax.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You starve us. First the drought, now you take what food we have left.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is your mate? The man they call Little.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He died last winter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so? We hear he is very much alive. Hiding out in the forest. He probably ran away to escape your scolding tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
</DIRECTION>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Norman swine!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at Gisborne's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only make it worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wulf backs off. Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seize him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Lord Nottingham's deer. Is this how you repay the Sheriff for his protection?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WULF>

<WULF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother lies to protect me.

<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Wulf!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have deprived us of a hunt, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He cups his hand in the deer's blood. Smears it on Wulf's face.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hounds know the scent well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us some pleasure before you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GISBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unleash them!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK Nearing home, Robin is buoyant. The Saracen, brooding, walks two paces behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why must you walk in back of me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are my burdens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASLAN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the Lord, that's it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say there are Arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. Is that not so?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops. Examines the darkening sky.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is close to sunset.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No reply. Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is she? The Mullah's daughter? ... Another man's wife?... That's it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Endless clouds. Is there no sun in your cursed country?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dog! You painted old dog! What is her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which way is East?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	East?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	East?!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin folds his arms. A standoff.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you!... Jasmina.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Jasmina! Is she beautiful?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which way is East?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan throws his rug on the ground. Kneels.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would know blindfolded. I'm five miles from home... Was she worth it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worth dying for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the branches. A hound savages his leg. The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep- titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers' horses.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not playing by the rules, boy. Deer don't climb trees... Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird. Shall we teach him to fly? Cut it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers hack at the trunk. The tree quivers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand back, stranger. This is no affair of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I advise you to move on, pilgrim. This is the Sheriff's land.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I grow dangerously tired of your wit... Chop it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man who strikes that tree dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chop down the hooded fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
(backing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we could discuss this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GISBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape... the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aslan! It's time to redeem that vow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Set the dogs on him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan ignores him, lost in his prayers. Robin lifts the other arm -- a second concealed crossbow. WHUMPF! The bolt flips the dog handler into the vicious pack. Dead or not, he soon will be. Robin unsheathes his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four of them cornered.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of flashing steel.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out. Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump. Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly. Blood flows from his arm. His sword falls.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aslan!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back. Robin freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hooded stranger, allow me to know your name before I run you through.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins, kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his pilgrim's hood.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robin of Locksley!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your knees, Gisborne. Pray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He obeys. Robin raises his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Locksley! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear. The man leaps.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab. Keeps running.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Aslan, furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You worthless savage! You travel ten thousand miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will fulfill my vow when I choose.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which does not include prayer times, meal times, or any time I'm outnumbered six to one!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You whine like a mule. You are still alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan examines Robin's wound. Dismissive.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A flesh wound. Why did you let their leader go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After six years of the stench of death, I have no stomach for needless blood on my hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have no fear, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The conquering hero returns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! It was you he was scared of.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan's humor is infectious. Robin's anger relents.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With feather pillows?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With feather pillows. Warm and soft like Jasmina's embrace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted. Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck dumb with horror. The dark courtyard. Heartsick, Robin stumbles over debris.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father! Hello!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MEDALLION round the corpse's neck. The Locksley crest.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture. Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained, Aslan looks on.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have been here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff ... Duncan.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Robin, is it you? A miracle. I thought God had abandoned us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy... Look at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Duncan steps into the moonlight. His face crudely- scarred.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What has happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say they captured him worshipping with the Druids. He signed a confession before the Bishop of Hereford.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did they have witnesses?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall. The Bishop decreed all the Locksley lands forfeit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you believe the charges?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even when they took my eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did this to you, Duncan?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff looking on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin holds the old retainer to his chest. Stares into the night in silent rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT Marked contrast. A forbidding fortress. Cliff-like battlements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving, stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak door.
</DIRECTION>
<SENTRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to be disturbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Away, fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves the Sentry aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis- tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she covers up.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who bade you cover up?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes his fist into his chair. She timidly uncovers.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin, I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black- ness.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met a hooded man today. He bade me warn you not to harm his people.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robin of Locksley.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! The prodigal son returns. He is a whelp. This girl could best him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whelp bested five of my men in the blink of an eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your men were probably drunk. Yet you survived, cousin?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW, wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible agility. MORTIANNA.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
(stunned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You brought her here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes. Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter. The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con- tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone dice -- Runes. She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every move. A connoisseur.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change the seat of power.

<NOTTINGHAM>

	London?

<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change it.

</NOTTINGHAM>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally with royal blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put someone on the throne and rule through him? Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is not revealed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind. Mounting intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ally with royal blood. What else do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Armies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yours. Men and weaponry in great numgers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And victory?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much blood will be spilled.

<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIANNA>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol. Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands again. Again the grinning skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE The tray smashes to the ground. The hag runs at Gisborne.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who have you seen?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes him. Screams spittle in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
(freaked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one. I have seen no one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lie! A man... A painted man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have seen my death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She whimpers. Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The painted man. He haunts my dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Locksley has a companion. A dark- skinned foreigner. He had the marked skin of Islam.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mortianna trembles like an epileptic. Eyes wide with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTIANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them! Kill them!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She throws herself at Nottingham for protection. He caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your survival was his last mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTIANNA>
<MORTIANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(frantic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the painted man! Kill him.

<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them both.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to stroke her. Her trembling subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have done well, Mortianna. Exceedingly well. No one shall harm you, I swear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the girl's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.
</DIRECTION>
<NOTTINGHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mortianna)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take her. You have earned her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist. Drags her away.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is madness bringing the hag here.

	Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in madness, there is great power.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - DAWN Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees. Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave. Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our last words in this world were spoken in anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to force other men to our religion. He was right.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I failed him. I should have been here at his side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must leave, head north to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're thinking. But one man can achieve nothing against so many. You would need an army.

Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNCAN>

	A curse on the Saracens! Were it not for their ungodly ways, he would never have left. This would never have happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Er... no.

	What manner of name is Aslan then?

Robin raises his dagger over his wrist. Aslan runs to him.

	Wait!

Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm. Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.

	We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and a fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fine, wet army. I have never witnessed a storm of such duration. When does summer come to this land?

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is summer.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, pray?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No food, no shelter, and weather that would curse the end of the earth. We will all quickly be dead, and I shall be rid of my vow.
	</DIALOGUE>

They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched mansion.

	You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends.

<ASLAN>

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY Robin pounds on the door. A hatch opens. An OLD WOMAN's face.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No beggars!

The hatch slams shut. Robin pounds again.

She slams the hatch again. Robin jams in his hand.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aagh!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the child Marian at home?
	</DIALOGUE>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't. Remove that hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly the hatch slams.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hospitality here is as warm as the weather.

</ROBIN>

They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack.

	Leave your weapons.

	Then show yourself, child. For we knew each other well.

<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the king away, these are lawless times. There are outlaws villainous enough to kidnap and ransom a relative of his.

	You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am sworn to protect you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Protect me? Robin of Locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow that years of war and prison may change a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>

She moves into the light... Fat. Rotten teeth. Ugly as sin.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>

	Er... the years have been kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Now remove yourself from this household.

	As you can see, we are already well protected.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, Marian! ...ouch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man -- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are truly courageous against an unarmed man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps. Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts, drawing a dagger. Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head. Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE The SOUND of the fight indoors. Aslan hurls himself at the door. It doesn't give.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts. The horns get shorter. Robin retreats. Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops. Robin wrenches off the mask. Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN. The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young woman stands over Robin.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As she was saying, we have no need of your protection.

Robin croaks through clenched teeth.

INT. KITCHEN Liquid tumbles into a goblet. The three men at a table in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves. Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin -- "Help!" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An impish grin.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust Lord Locksley has recovered from his indisposition.
	</DIALOGUE>

Aslan laughs. Robin glares.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in her voice.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would he wish me to be protected by the boy who burned my hair when I was a child?

	We were together five terrible years in a Saracen prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>

	Marian, I'm sorry.

She turns her back. He searches for a way to reach her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people fear the Druids so much they'd believe anything. Nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a witch if he thought he could possess my property.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIAN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not retreat. Besides, I have no interest in life at court. Gossip-mongering and currying favor. Here I am my own person.

	The you must allow me to be your guardian.

<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her. Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty or more. In battle armor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soldiers coming here? Is this your protection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIAN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can take care of myself. There are horses in the stable. Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan runs into the stables.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop them! They're stealing my horses!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on. Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been sheltering outlaws, Lady Marian.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're thieves, you imbecile. Bring back my horses, or the Sheriff will know of your cowardice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gisborne knows she is lying.
</DIRECTION>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lucky he didn't steal your virtue too.

<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A crown to the man who brings me Locksley's head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the pursuit. A SOLDIER hangs back. Grabs Marian's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss this!

</GISBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt. Jabs the blade into his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try me again, if you want to leave a hand behind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently. CUT TO: EXT. STREAM Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men. Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you, animal!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan shouts from the far bank.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Treat it like a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or die.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you never had a woman? Gently, man. Soothe it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pats the horse soothingly. The animal edges forward.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Softly. With your knees.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know! I know!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers reload. Robin urges the horse at the steep drop.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps. Their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.

	What is your pleasure, Gisborne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was I who strung your father's corpse to the castle gate. My pleasure will be in doing the same to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You survived one meeting. Our next will be your last.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GISBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father died a coward, cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GISBORNE>

Incensed, he is losing his judgement.

<ASLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a trap.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne split off, are climbing the embankment towards him. Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub. Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have lost them. I'll lame this mare if I ask her to go any farther.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds it to his eye. A primitive telescope. Robin watches, curious.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Arab science.

He replaces the tube in his pouch.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either we take our chances with the ghosts, or become ghosts ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not following.
	</DIALOGUE>

Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.

<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones. Aslan draws his sword.

<DUNCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Banshees. They say they fly in your mouth and suck you dry of blood before you can scream.

He wraps his scarf over his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet! Listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds, striking only air.

<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allah protect us from the evil spirits.

Duncan clings to his back. Robin points.

Aslan slashes out, futilely.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>

<DIRECTION>
Aslan flails. Robin cracks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cease your mad laughing. I can feel them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end. A low chilling MOAN.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red- jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. Catapults him to the ground. The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth- century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL SCARLET, leaps around Robin.

Aslan makes no move to intervene.

The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL_SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall down. Beg for mercy, rich man.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet. His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes when he laughs, which is often.

	</DIALOGUE>
<WILL_SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For passage through Sherwood.

	A man who travels with two servants and claims he's without money, is either a fool or a liar.

Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily, Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.

<ROBIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, father! I know him.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man is your father? Tell him how I saved your hide from the Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves some gratitude, I believe.

He reaches for the medallion. John pulls it away.

<JOHN_LITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw ya don't, laddie.

	Be careful, Father. He fights like a demon. He walloped six o' Sheriff's men?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOHN_LITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free. Bends it into a pretzel.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aslan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WULF>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut. John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's stomach. Robin folds.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL_SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear! The little rich boy is lost for words. Thanks for the taxes, Locksley.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOHN_LITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into the tree. Will administers one final kick before leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously at Aslan.

CUT TO: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge. Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge, brandishing a long wooden staff.
</DIRECTION>

<JOHN_LITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, m'old cock. You wanna nuther good wallopin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin connects a blow on John's foot. The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings, which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing. Enjoying the time of his life. Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength. Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly. Aslan watches impassively. Robin scrambles back onto the bridge. John waits, grinning.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks. John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows him time to right himself. John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_LITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters. Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank. No sign.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_LITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave 'un.
	</DIALOGUE>

Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might. John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_LITTLE>

The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the surface.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.

He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to Aslan.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With regrets, I decline.

John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree trunk.

Drunken laughter. Robin turns to the next man at the fireside.

The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a comprehensible word.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That be Hal Brownwell, but the lads call i'm Hal Hiccup.

The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his tormentors.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold! Hal, you have the face and hands of a farmer. I wager you are a strong and honest man, and I'd be glad to have you at my side in a fight. The next man who makes light of you will have to answer to me.

Murmurs of agreement from around the fire. Robin turns to Will.

</ROBIN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man's son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you. Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne's men, I, too, became an outlaw.

<LITTLE_JOHN>

Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long draught of mead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - SUNRISE A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess. Robin sits, brooding.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
<DIRECTION>

<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Learn what? To build kennels?

He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side. The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously hung-over.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>

	Too much mead, old friend. What day is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DUNCAN>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham. Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin, dressed as Duncan.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CITY GATE - DAY Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.

	Alas, the King has many enemies both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY (LATER) Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators.

<DIRECTION>
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs in his heels. Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins back to the attack. His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder. Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away. Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's chest. Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly. Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword. Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough. Douses his face. Yells at Will.

</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, Will! You aim like a girl, Will!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug of war. Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away. Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back- wards off his mount. Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank the Lord you are not endowed like Bull.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Together they run down the hill, keeping low. Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels. ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces camouflaged. The mounted soldiers charge them. The woodsmen run into the trees. As the horsemen close in, the runners leap into a trench. Lift up matted screens of brush and grass. It's as if they disappeared. The soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens. More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods- men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file, beating their way through the tangled branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the river gorge. Momentum carries many of them over the cliff. BACK ON ROADWAY Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins, steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are unable to fire at them. Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse, driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen is lifted into place, covering their route.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone. He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and cursing. EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof. Angry shouts from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>

	Surrender your weapons. I give you my word you shall go free.

In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near his feet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, I feared as much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside, panic. Drowning rats. The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead. Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at them. CUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around. Cheers of celebration.

<ROBIN>

	It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person.

Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed, Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal full in the face.

	Giddyup, nag!

He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch his robe in wonder.

With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan leaps INTO VIEW. Stripped to the waist, brandishing his scimitar. The Captain tries to back away. Robin tries to restrain Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling, drooling at the mouth, Aslan explores the Captain's body with his hands. A butcher checking meat.

Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then silence.

The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm. Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates wildly at the Captain.

Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac- ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses, camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not about to admit it.

Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face. Screaming, he grabs his face.

A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be- tween his shoulders. In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTIANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(horror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The painted man!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A curved scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in the other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked guards are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats, scurry- ing into the depths of the cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy. A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark- ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his feet... and lunges.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks. Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's. Robin is slumped against a rock.

Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.

<WULF>

Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be- low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock. For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom, hatred, fear -- then is gone.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering, glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks the light from his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have poisoned you. There are herbs that can alter a man's brain. I know of only one cure.

He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers down his throat.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY Fire. Blazing rampant. Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming arrows ignites the trees. Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback. One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight. Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head- pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up to the Chieftain.

<DIRECTION>
With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits. Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol- diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword. Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors. They charge forward.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the edge of the clearing.

He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.

Robin debates. Relents. They urge their horses into a gallop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest. From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat, turn and fire again. They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are being decimated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy, inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant. Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.

<FRIAR>

He pummels the man to the ground with his staff. The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group, including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others fight on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through them, slashing with his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bout bleedin' time, mush.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver- ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck glances heavenwards.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And thank you, Allah.

<DIRECTION>
Aslan is a wild man. Steering his horse with just legs and knees, he strikes out with both swords to left and right. The momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the edge of the clearing. Starts picking off stragglers. His father spots him.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back... but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet. When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down. Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down with both swords. Both men topple to the ground simultaneously. Suddenly all is quiet. The smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. Only four men seem to be alive. Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and Hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't 'ee start bleedin' blubberin', or ya'll make me bloody vomit.

	It was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery. Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor and weapons into a growing pile.

INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol- lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them Wulf and Will Scarlet.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT A winter's night. Bitterly cold. Sad figures huddled around a small fire. Fanny tends to John's wounds, their little ones asleep by their feet. John drinks and passes the jug to Tuck, who numbly shakes his head. Too depressed even to drink. Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.

Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips it from his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you, too, Father. You reared a coward and a fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging branch. CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
NOVEMBER MOON Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion, dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white moon against the black sky... DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE -- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner. The round medallion has become a noose. In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another -- Bull. Another -- Marian.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me, Robin.

The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.

<LOCKSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why have you betrayed me? Why?

Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope. His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous cacophony. DISSOLVE TO:

ROBIN'S FACE DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away the horror.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround the base. The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose. SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the barrels. A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow. The executioner's eyes glint through the slits. Nottingham intently watches Wulf. The Chieftain stands, impassive. Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns. Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge. His eyes close. An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye slit. The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap. Wulf's body plunges. The rope snaps tight. Little John yells. Fanny screams. A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch... Robin! Wulf dangles, strangling. His hands wrench at the choking cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape. The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked... by the Celt with the boar's head. KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass confusion. Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's rope. He hauls him onto the platform.
</DIRECTION>

Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig... It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his arm.

A reprise of his own fight with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and around the horse's legs. Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat. Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood. Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It EXPLODES. The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the parapet.

The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war. Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in. He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his horse. Will leaps on him.

<DIRECTION>
Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to the floor. Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword. Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows. Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet. Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with all his strength. The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.

<ASLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you fear is not below.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest. Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it further through her body in her effort to get at him. Clutching, screeching, hissing. Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle- ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the altar.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder, Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into the freezing water. She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back. Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers, enjoying the show.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robin? Oh God, is that you?
