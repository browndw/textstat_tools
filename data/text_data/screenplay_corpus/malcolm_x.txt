EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is not dissuaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing being done just so, in time-honored fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar. He adds water and makes a paste of the starch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON) one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good to me at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The men laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLLY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY_S_VOICE>
<TOOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black sunovabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you let me tell it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of rubber gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Homeboy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<DIRECTION>
He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red's in the head, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<TOOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean hiding in the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOOMER>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<TOOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, Homeboy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOOMER>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, don't scare him more than he's scared already. Ain't too bad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, Homeboy?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MALCOLM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a kind of execution.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Git his forehead and eyebrows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<SHORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what I'm doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area. Now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORTY>
<DIRECTION>
(contd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a hole through cement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<CHOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MALCOLM
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said it was gonna sting... this ain't nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries to catch his breath: his head is on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(contd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You motherfucker. You're killing me. I'm burning up. My damn head is on fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the congolene into his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting Malcolm and the shop in the process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<SHORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<DIRECTION>
Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into the jacket...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ...... dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, all right, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, all reet, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked, zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully aware of their impact.

INT. ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both were posed for a picture. The music "FLYING HOME" is blaring as LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the dancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately BLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks. And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed couples on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond hair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The music begins to get faster and more furious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U around the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined by a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the main event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to get better vantage points and the competition is under way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, mostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of refinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one in particular, but nonetheless looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more remarkable quality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. He makes his way through the watching audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - LAURA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, baby, let's show 'em how.

</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of sneakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect partner. She loves it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WITH THE CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go, man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: - SHORTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp waves over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to his steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and Malcolm go into a solo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - SHORTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.
</DIRECTION>
<SHORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, gimme some skin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHORTY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shorty, this is Laura.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock his black world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MALCOLM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for it.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, and come on back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOPHIA>
<DIRECTION>
He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIA>
<DIRECTION>
(contd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you get back.

ANGLE - SOPHIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe white breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might say Sophia was way ahead of her time.
</DIRECTION>

Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.

The elderly man nods. He is big, he is very black. The same color as Malcolm's father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MALCOLM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his glass, toasts Archie and downs it. Then leaning into the bar, asks:
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BARTENDER>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whut's he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender would not normally answer this, but Malcolm is the man of the moment, so the bartender speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This and that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm nods, then looks over again at Archie -- in appreciation. Archie wiggles a finger for him to come over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT ARCHIE'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is standing.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>

Archie laughs. Even Sammy smiles. Cadillac still holds his judgment.

<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(touching his head)

<DIRECTION>
Archie and Sammy laugh at his directness. Cadillac smiles. Archie pushes back his chair, about to get up.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got me a little run to make.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm has suddenly been excluded and he wants desperately back in.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I run with you, Mr. Archie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Archie eyes him, weighing him seriously.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
	</DIALOGUE>

</ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is looking at himself in a mirror in Archie's room. He has on the full outfit now, together with a new white on white shirt and a Sulka tie. Looks great.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just the middle button, baby. Just the middle one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHIE>

Malcolm buttons the jacket and turns around, demonstrating for Archie's inspection.

</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(contd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Do me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm frisks him carefully: pats his sides, his pockets, under his arms, his legs. Archie is clean to the touch.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(contd) (triumphantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm still carrying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He smacks the small of his back. Then, reaching under his coat, he takes a revolver out from the middle of his back. And hands it to Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - MALCOLM

Holding the deadly instrument, fascinated by it, hefting it, feeling its power.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's yours, baby. Put it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm slips it carefully into the small of his back, behind his trouser belt. His first gun: the feeling shines in his eyes, Bogart has become a black man.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ARCHIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is music playing. Wordlessly, Archie sprinkles a few grains of fine crystal onto a round shaving mirror. He slides it across a table to Malcolm and hands him a short straw. Sophia sits next to Malcolm; she and Archie are already high. Malcolm leans over the mirror, placing the straw in his nostril.
</DIRECTION>

TIGHT CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE

EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A miserable night, raining and cold. Malcolm turns into the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through. He is now a familiar figure to the bar's DENIZENS. He is met with ad lib cries: "Hey, Little," "Have a taste," from the men; and from the women: "Come here, sugar," "Where you been?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar. It's immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him. He is no longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Malcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress.

<A_FEMALE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daniel come in yet, Honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice. It's familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past. He looks toward the bar and sees the women who asked the question.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAURA - MALCOLM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw. She is still young, still vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed. She is unaware of Malcolm.
</DIRECTION>
<HONEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't that him now?
	</DIALOGUE>

ANGLE FAVORING DANIEL. He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly. He goes to the corner of the bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, gorgeous, how you been? Waiting long? Lemme see you. Wow!

Malcolm's glass on the table is trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, bitch.

</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his arm to hit her and it is held back before it can find its mark.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that.

	Honey, he didn't mean it.

Archie wiggles his fingers and Honey goes, but not before throwing daggers at Malcolm and Sophia. Archie sits down, takes out a cigar. For a good beat there is a coolness between them. Then Malcolm reaches over and lights Archie's cigar. Sophia stares at her man, he then motions for her to sit down beside him.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE CELL CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 P.M. The line of PRISONERS stands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one white, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon the white guard slams the door shut and locks it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer -- beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him with great respect.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looka Satan.

</PETE>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see him.

</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He bout to bust.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break.

</BEMBRY>

It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry.

Shaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face.

<DIRECTION>
INT. A SOLITARY CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of a mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the mattress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clang as the heavy door is opened.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_CONE>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room. Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUSTEE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRUSTEE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, wrenching it off in his fury.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury. He pounds the walls. Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the walls, he slides to the floor of the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOLITARY - LATER

</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
A shower is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his broken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his problems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's Bembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in the water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how you feel. Like you want to lay down and die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
(contd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.

</BEMBRY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, what do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties the contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down or it might knock you down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry wonderingly, unable to figure him out.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.

	Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?

	That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you give it to me for then?
	</DIALOGUE>

<BEMBRY>

	'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
This is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in the hell are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you got more sense than any cat in this prison. How come you are such a fool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks over, piqued.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
(contd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the movies. Because even if you get out, you are still in prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't lying.

</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>

These last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his hands massaging the conk into his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Putting all that poison in your hair.

<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Why does everybody conk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't said I'm ashamed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn. Bembry restrains him, holding his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leggo. I got to wash it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
But it is burning now.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, you better get off me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, I don't want to hear all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry has said disturbs him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the barrage.
</DIRECTION>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elijah who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEMBRY>

And he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful moment. He is pulling the comb through his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes license plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks to the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, idles by a window.
</DIRECTION>

A whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out into the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.

Malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis.

	Then what you telling me to study in them for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<BEMBRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Bembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the Bible. Right now he goes into street talk.

Malcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man. Then caught by a passage he does not understand:

He is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go out. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the "a's": the words azimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his hand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its meaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word for word.

EXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	The white people who are guilty of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to uplift the mentality, the social, and economic condition of black people in this country. And the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting the black people economically, civilly, and otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic simply because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community. The black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for 400 years, and following the ignorant Negro preachers, we have thought that it was God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they use to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them to love their enemy or pray for those who use them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is showing black people that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has God given rights, natural rights, civil rights, and any other kind of rights that you can think of when it comes to defending himself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle -- especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity.

I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white.

	I don't see why that should be controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves.

	<DIALOGUE>
	For Harlem is where he worked, and where he struggled and fought. His home of homes, where his heart was and where his people are. And it is therefore most fitting that we meet once again in Harlem to share these last moments with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to those who loved her, have fought for her and defended her honor even to death. It is not in the memory of man that this beleaguered, unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has found a braver, more gallant young champion than this Afro-American who lies before us unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain and we will smile and we will answer and say unto them:
