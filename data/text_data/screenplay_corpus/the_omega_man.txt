WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a stun gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.

Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building.

The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his stun gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard.

He unlimbers stun gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, stun gun ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLETS REACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away.
</DIRECTION>

In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT DOOR OF OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Neville’s response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED.

He walks, one hand in pocket, a stun gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his stun gun is in his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there
</DIRECTION>

Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT

as Neville whirls, stun gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire.

Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes into the shadows of the store.
</DIRECTION>

He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand.

He stands thus for a long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her.

EXT. STORE MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focused on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity.

Then his head comes up. He has control again.

<NEVILLE>

CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, stun gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE

MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine
</DIRECTION>

MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar.

SLOW FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance, TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA.

CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low.

He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him.

WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields.

MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp.

Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor?

As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city.

MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre.

As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Neville’s death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N.

empty and the fountain splashes untended. We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower.

MED. SHOT - LISA AND GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neck down. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents:

Suddenly, above her monologue, she HEARS a SOUND. A SOB. It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the stun gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing.
