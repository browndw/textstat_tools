The members of the unit consist of the father, JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges, and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who possesses what can only be described as an apple pie sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl, complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.

Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room, holding tightly to his wrist.

<SETH>

	Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?

<RICHARD>

INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from the Old-Timer.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe he's stopping here. This place looks totally cruddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor home.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, why are we stopping here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the meter home door and climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing wrong with this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a flop house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has a bed. That's all I care about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's thinking about how he's going to get over the border tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the Fuller's motor home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor. THUD... THUD...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Owww, my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch where you're going!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing up at the giant motor home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this guy's problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to move. Not threatening, just looking at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HONK!
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anytime, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one side to let them pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pass they do!
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creepy guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
SETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up. POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP. He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope none of this is disturbing you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob opens the door and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the nicest guy in the entire world.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is Don Cornelius. No, not the Don Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my lady friend need some ice and we don't seem to have an ice bucket. Could we possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
(still partially asleep)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called a punch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jacob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacob.

</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>

Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, move the Jap over there.
	</DIALOGUE>

Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upsy daisy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
...guiding him over to the bed by his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(to his hostages)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?

</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

</SETH>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this about, money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad Kate walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brothers spin their guns in her direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun ready to spit.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Scott and Jacob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob and Scott freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
They slowly sit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both for their own reasons.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jacob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the keys to the motor home?

<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP KATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?

Richard's eyes go to Seth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not when you get around to it, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and put on some clothes.

She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth GRABS her wrist.

Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that easy.

</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get ready to move out, we're all going on a little ride.

Jacob shakes his head "no."

Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room, leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet, conversational tone.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>

	I ain't got time to fuck around with you, so I'll make this simple. Take your kids and get in the car, or I'll execute all three of you right now.

	I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.

</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?

That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.

</SETH>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?

	THE TITTY TWISTER Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn
	</DIALOGUE>

Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted by a neon hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of Mexico.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD, RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls outside reading things like:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD", "BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN", "THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT", "DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM", "ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY TWISTER DANCERS."

In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer. A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall. A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, troops, this is the homestretch. Here's the deal; this place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here sometime before dawn. Which by my guesstimate is somewhere between three or four hours from now. So we're gonna go in there, take a seat, have a drink -- have a bunch of drinks, and wait for Carlos. That could be an hour, that could be three hours, I don't know which. But when he gets here, me and Richie are going to leave with him. After we split, you guys are officially out of this stewpot. Let me just say I'm real happy about where we're at. We got a real nice, "I don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck with me" attitude going on. Now, if everybody just keeps playin' it cool -- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie -- everybody's gonna get what they want. Comprende, amigos?

INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood and the beer at closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers, while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of bikers and truckers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em, but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

Everybody looks at Jacob.

<DIRECTION>
As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you look outside your door, parked in your parking lot, you'll see a big ass recreational vehicle. That's mine. In order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver's license. That is the same license that the DMV requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck.

Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor Charlie's head.

The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the music builds to its explosive section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTANICO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Richard in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTANICO>
<DIRECTION>
Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she surveys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping the beat with his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what Seth and company did to Chet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard continues to suck her toes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks down at the seated Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds, none louder than Seth.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what I call a fuckin' show!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe, which she puts on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping his fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie, you lucky bastard!

<DIRECTION>
(to Santanico)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, little lady, you could of just as easily done that to me. Who a Nelly! You got my dick harder 'n Chinese arithmetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
The table laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red Riding Hood is walking through the forest and she comes across Little Bo Peep, and Little Bo Peep says: "Little Red Riding Hood, are you crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you he's gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?" Then Little Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says: "No he won't."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>

	Oh, shit.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seth --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
Seth waves him away.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now. So finally she comes across the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red Riding Hood, you know better than to be walking around these woods alone. You know I'm just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat me, just like the story says."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard, Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say anything --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.
</DIRECTION>
<RAZOR_CHARLIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_EMILIO>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off, ape man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from his wounded shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico steps back from the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor. Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake and SLASHES Seth across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to his laid open cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound, brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly before he hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay out of gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what they were doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music continues to play, though the dancers stop dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her NOSTRILS FLARE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief and puts it to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scarred for life, that's how I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right... left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody be cool, or you'll be just as dead as these fucks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls to the floor, splattering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face could easily be read as intense sexual desire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's transformation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie, look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Richie can turn around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth turns to his brother's cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming about, trying to knock her off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard screams to Seth:
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He can't get a clear shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico rides him down to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about half way before he stops, saying:
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(with his dying breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking Bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He tumbles over, a corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patrons scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar and yells:
</DIRECTION>
<WHORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner is served!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHORE>
<DIRECTION>
The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping VAMPIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vamps attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven necks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other. Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size. The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades, anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar. They hide and watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand, too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands motionless, watching what he can't believe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard, eyes POP OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She RISES in her snake/dance way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTANICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see if you taste as good as your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTANICO>
<DIRECTION>
She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the FLOOR and INTO the WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE, goes head to head with a stripper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp bitch blow for blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her on the wooden leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie appears, straight razor in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half. Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the vampire's death scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTANICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna drain you completely. You're gonna turn for me, You'll be my slave. You'll live for me. You'll eat bugs because I order it. Because I don't think you're worthy of human blood, you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool. And at my command, you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel. Since you'll be my dog, your new name will be "Spot". Welcome to slavery.

SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP SANTANICO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes the liquor-soaked robe ignite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_EMILIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_EMILIO>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to Jacob.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We may be in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off Seth and Jacob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him look like a huge walking shark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you, monkey man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SEX_MACHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything you gotta say to them, say to me first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEX_MACHINE>
<DIRECTION>
Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He effortlessly knocks them away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both hit the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come ahead."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway locomotive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio, who HITS the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp, BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the savage beating.
</DIRECTION>
<SEX_MACHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEX_MACHINE>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob and Seth stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead vamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from around his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his trouble. Chet dives at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what everybody says about me? I suck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GULP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain. He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming all the while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the customers have been butchered or drained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding wooden stakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four human men group together. The four female vampires charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood. Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four staked bodies hit the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<FROST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't they supposed to burn up or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROST>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense light, which lasts only a split second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his dead hand.
</DIRECTION>

Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I love you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away. He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo. Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar. He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate, of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at the bar.

	I saved your life. I didn't have to, but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're gonna get out of this we need each other. And we need you sober and thinking, not drunk and...

As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to identify it.

The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get inside.

INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little claws poke their way through.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other items to help secure and barricade the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the room in her direction.
</DIRECTION>
<SEX_MACHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out, girly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEX_MACHINE>
<DIRECTION>
The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine, Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue. As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's heart. He dies and bursts into flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

<DIRECTION>
The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap, SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for a loop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames, which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to work STAKING the dead bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and whatever else is at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands in front of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a problem!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its body through the newly formed hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45, point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS his head back through the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM !
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING, LANDING HARD on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>

<DIRECTION>
Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo. Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a while, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with the bat-thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together, exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue to try and claw their way in.

</JACOB>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.

<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.

	Another thing, you try and ram a broken chair leg in a human, you better be one strong son-of-a-bitch. The human body is one rough-tough machine. But these vamps got soft bodies.

	I'm not taunting you. We need you. A faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us. But a man who's a servant of God can grab a cross, shove it in these monsters' asses. A servant of God can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon.

Seth rises.

Well, I changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago' cause I know, without a doubt, what's out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight from hell. And if there is a hell, and those monsters are from it, there's got to be a heaven. Now which are you, a faithless preacher or a mean, mother fuckin' servant of God?

Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me, listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour...

As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE say:

Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and pulls it back, so he can really haul off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the air.

Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the hand and runs for the backroom.

Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott, who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams, howls and snaps in fury.

Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad, whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone. As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant sight trip him up.

Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Children, listen to me. I love you two more than anybody. And I just want you to know you've made me proud all your lives. But never more so than tonight. And I wish we could sit here and cry till I pass on, but we can't. Because I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to turn into a monster. And when I do, I'm going to be dangerous. But before that happens, just know I love you.

(to Seth and the kids)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I'd say in the next twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door. And I'll probably turn into a vampire within the hour. Now, you have two choices. You can wait for me to turn, then deal with me, then wait for them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them. Or, we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit 'em with everything we have, and carve a path right through 'em to front entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em, we gotta go at 'em now. I confused them, I scared them, I took them off guard. But they're going to get unconfused, they're going to get unscared, they're going to get together and they're going to hit that door like a ton of bricks. And when that moment arrives, we gotta be ready.

MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee, teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting their courage back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate makes water balloons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons, turning it into holy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come. The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side. The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching, pounding, squeaking and screaming.

Finally they're ready.

Jacob turns to his kids.

<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we go any further, I need you three to promise me something. I'll fight with you to the bitter end, but when I turn into one of them, I won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a lap dog of Satan. I want you three to promise you'll take me down, no different from the rest.

Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his temple.

INT. BARROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then, like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by starting up the jackhammer.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill 'em all!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and HURLS toward the group.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming the hammer stake into vampire chests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other junk.

<DIRECTION>
Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room, he CRASHES into a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She screams:
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in fiery death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow. His eyes are yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and SMASHES it against Jacob's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it up to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares with the boy he once called his son.

Scott's eyes turn to steel.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead, creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire head bursts into flames, then explodes.

Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining vamps approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon.

The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched.

The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The .45's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two survivors hold hands, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on from the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vamps look towards it in horror.

The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps are instantly fried, bursting into flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves in fright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps combust in fiery explosions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot.
