EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a perfect day.

A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and parks beside the slat and shingled building.

TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.

He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his marksmanship.

Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the TV above the counter. On it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too, wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine. Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.

Cameron nods his head in resignation. A big uncontrollable grin breaks and spreads over the cop's face.

Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him. One has almost got his gun out.

Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he breaks free and runs.

EXT. REAR OF DINER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences, between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat. He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone linemen we saw earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron. The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked. The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.

</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull, he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground. A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed grasp and dashes off into the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no pursuers, the forest is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his sharp outcry.

Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.

The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him. ANGLE ON CAMERON

Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the momentum.
</DIRECTION>

Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows. Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred- eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed, expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be caused by the current.
</DIRECTION>

It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing, catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water, hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks, away from the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERON - MOVING SHOT

Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back, THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look, from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each other. Cameron runs on.

A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier, boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.

Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward the town. EXT. BOARDWALK

<DIRECTION>
The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.' THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis. The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors, whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky, perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling. Cameron watches it warily as he walks.

Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts, grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water. She is choking, gasping for air. She turns her face toward him.

CAMERON'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. She frees her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER MASK on which is the melting putty and make up. With it goes her wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.

</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face, ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking - a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to that kind of "movie star" beauty. It's something Cameron feels in the pit of his stomach.

CAMERON'S POV - POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLICE CAR has driven onto the beach. From it, THREE OFFICERS have emerged. They are armed and efficient looking. The PRODUCTION MANAGER moves to greet them. Eli takes Cameron's wrist and gently pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt). JAKE, the Chief, is irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance.

CHUCK BARTON is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film. A MESSENGER trots up and presents a receipt book. Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently.

Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder roll, he somersaults to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERON>

	Very fancy.

He takes a running start and does the same. Not quite as well, but well enough. As he rolls to his feet:

<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Burt's specialty was drowning. You know one goddamn daredevil on this picture was enough! What the hell was Eli thinking, giving me a smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when I need a stunt man! It's a little different running across that roof when they're pumping tracer bullets over your head.

Cameron sailing into the SHOT. Chuck ducks slightly, catching Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. Cameron lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building. Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. The church steeple can be seen in b.g.

Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his shoulder. Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. Cameron scrambles to follow.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll draw a sight line for you to follow down the roof here, while you're rolling. Now there's nothing very difficult. But this is where you gotta think. Your mind can't be on snatch. It's gotta be on grabbing that gutter.

INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING - ASYLUM SET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in a World War I military asylum. In it, Eli's crew is filming a sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters, heads shaven, wild- eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of Cameron's exultant yell).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated derelicts suddenly swarm over him. One, like a mad dog, goes fro his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club. Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams.

There, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits Eli, cross-legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby. He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane.

Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli, squatting beside him on the sand pile.

Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his few belongings into his pockets.

WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in evidence. Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the dresser. He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty. He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door. Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false teeth, which he finally finds. Now, annoyed at himself for being a "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly exits.

<DIRECTION>
Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about her face -- a hauntingly romantic image. ANGLE ON CAMERON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches for a moment with hopeless longing. Finally, turning from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk. There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby spot to light a night shot. There's the CHURCH TOWER. He stares at it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen if...

INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine fright.

It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in shock and confusion.

A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN, a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levi's and sport shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower. TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER
</DIRECTION>

The Second A.D. slams his hand down on a PLUNGER, setting off a series of explosive squibs. Like machine gun bullets, they start shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the edge of the tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower. Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand. He shoves out, launching himself into space. Twisting, hurtling across the gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof, crawling and scrambling for a hand hold. The relentless tracer bullets chip the slate beside him. Crouching low, Cameron, like an animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower. Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving around the tower, suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS running at him with bayoneted rifles. He wheels and there stands ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his rifle butt. The blow glances off Cameron. They grapple, kicking, clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum. RAIN GUTTER
</DIRECTION>

The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop. Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles in space toward the ground. CAMERON

AWNING

<DIRECTION>
At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe landing and smashes against the awning. Instead of holding, it rips apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas toward a skylight one floor below.

Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall. The MAN and WOMAN who were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll entwined with him. Cameron is dazed. Like a drowning man, he rages to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh. A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is in is thrown open, revealing:

Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War I German army brothel. In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row of cots separated by makeshift screens. COUPLES jump up from the cots startled. A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's unorthodox entrance.

Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has caused this humiliation.

He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't noticed.

Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we see the same biplane flying low. An object drops from the cockpit (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our eyes during the crash.

It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every direction. The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground. The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending. The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze. It is Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform. ANGLE WIDENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him, steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness. With the camera, they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four- legged creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some advancing German soldiers back toward the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning. Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet. Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British plane. It is a single-seater. It starts to pick up speed. He grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing.

The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane, completing Gabe's spectacular shot. Now we see a HELICOPTER drop into frame, photographing the plane from the other side. The chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun. ANGLE ON CAMERON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly against the struts. His white silk scarf streams into the tearing wind. Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds it up. The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. Laughing, he passes a glass to Cameron and pours from above. The liquid is lost in the wind. Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron. Cameron drinks. The champagne pours down his throat and face and, holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his bottle back. Cameron now seems drunk. He lets go of the strut and stands leaning against the wind. As the pilot toasts his courage, Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of the wing. Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. The pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm..." And Cameron dances the Charleston. INT. HELICOPTER

CLOSE ON BIPLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron holds the boot poised, lets go. Then, the pilot is struck by a bursting shell. As he slumps over, the plane skids and slips and drops off into a spin. Cameron clings for his life as the sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space. WIDE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane. The crewmen shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving. Cameron is, indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the centrifugal force. But, if his hands slip, he will fall ten feet instead of to certain death.

As the swinging arm of the crane glides the plane forward toward a stand of trees at the edge of a clearing.

PAST CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the rapidly approaching trees. Closer and closer, until with a horrendous crash, the plane sails between two trunks, shearing off the wingtips, the nose smashing into another, hurling Cameron off the wing like a crumb flicked from the table. EXTREME CLOSE UP - CAMERON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apparently hurtling through the air, his eyes widen at the impending impact. A gasp and then a sharp cry. But instead of the crash...the ANGLE WIDENS and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm. With extreme contentment on his face, he rolls over revealing Nina, who, it is clear, has also had a lovely time.

WIDER ANGLE - INT. NINA'S HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are in bed in a pleasant large room (the Queen Anne Suite), untidy, with script pages, wigs, costumes, fresh flowers, the leftovers of a room service dinner. Nina caresses his back, noticing bruises. She kisses them gently and starts to giggle. He looks at her quizzically.

Cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock, but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig. He runs his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring.

<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>

The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. He gets on the bed with her. THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING. They struggle about, giggling at the absurdity.

Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more time. Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward, he realizes he's seeing BURT'S DEATH SCENE in the water. Now Chuck has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward again. CLOSE UP - VIEWER OF MOVIOLA

The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burt's shoulder, the car flying through the air, hitting the water and sinking beneath the surface. Burt goes through the motions of a man trying to free himself.

	There! Look at that. He's starting to panic. Will you, for Christ's sake, tell me why?

As Chuck slows the film, we see Burt's head duck beneath the view of the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and windshield. For an instant, the current changes the light and the crack glows brightly, like a spider web. Burt reappears, his face now toward camera, wild with terror. The slow motion lends a bizarre elegance to his agony. Abruptly, the FILM GOES BLACK.

ANGLE - EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it explodes, Cameron is BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL -- ON FIRE. He tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with muddy water. Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a THUNDERING SOUND...an ENGLISH CAISSON hurtles toward him, the driver dead and mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror. Before Cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him. He rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson barely missing him. Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all about. Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell.

The pleasant SEAFOOD RESTAURANT is on the pier over the water. Cameron, now wearing Sam's sweater after all, is searching about the crowded room trying to find Nina and what might be her family. He is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a MAN and WOMAN in their early fifties and a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL, attractive despite the baby fat. Something about the composite of all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look. In doing so, he sees a half-eaten BIRTHDAY CAKE on their table, in front of an empty place. He goes to the table.

INT. BASEMENT SCREENING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dailies are in progress. Eli watches, surrounded by a few crew members. Cameron sits in the back row with Nina's MOTHER, FATHER and SISTER. Nina is not present. On the PORTABLE SCREEN is a shot of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET, dodging children and bicycles. She collides with an OLD MAN, her basket falls, its contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected with her joy of life. He helps her refill the basket and she rewards him with a sausage and a kiss. The old man watches her wistfully as she runs away. ANGLE ON PARENTS

ANGLE ON PORTABLE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room dims and the film starts. We see a slate board reading "150A Take 1." The clapper claps and the board is removed, revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop Raymond's naked body, her breasts resting on his chest, her legs apart, interlocked with his. They look directly at the CAMERA awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting for the Wilshire bus. The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying Nina's back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can. She disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The ANGLE TIGHTENS into a less revealing, more artistic composition. Their mouths meet. Their bodies writhe. CLOSE ON NINA'S PARENTS

She's now made up to look like a woman in her forties. Everything about her tells us these have been brutal years, filled with pain and loss. She is reacting in anguish to something O.S. But, even though she manages a few tears, it doesn't quite ring true. Eli steps into the shot.

Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera, only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned into her father's memory.

As the three enter. The station is old with a high sergeant's desk and wooden benches against the walls. Raymond, beyond tears, destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts, stoned kids, etc. On one bench is a SAILOR, with that adenoidal look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch" arrogance. Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that he has finally nailed Eli Cross. Eli captures the setup in a glance...then, instant theater. He strides across the police station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack on the mouth.

Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases, pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns. There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only a glance to her, he goes on with his search.

Suddenly the ice turns to steam. His self-control shatters like glass. There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel, before an audience of one, Cameron ERUPTS, spewing out the memory of his mortification and crucifixion...not without the silent resignation of Jesus, but with the howling rage of a mad dog...Pluto with the rabies...

</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to hurl it, he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on his back. The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS cascade on top of him. It looks disastrous. Nina runs to him, terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing and screaming as he struggles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing. But Cameron, who has somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin, screaming:

With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable guffaw.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds, but Nina fails.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERON>
<DIRECTION>
Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.

INT. GARAGE - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin waiting in the slumber room before services begin. Behind it, a side door of the garage opens. But it is not visitors coming to pay their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina. He is wearing Burt's clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the big overhead garage doors and hits the electric SWITCH. NOTHING HAPPENS. He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights illuminate the reality of the garage. Nina has started the convertible, as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles.

EXT. THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river, idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. As it grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll from the vibration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short, tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads, its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the coffin on its caisson.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints.

The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past. Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped. Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up, (recalling that moment in the tower):

</DIRECTION>

The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning, tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward like a dying bird. INT.

INT. DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening, shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window, Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina, standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water as the car plunges toward the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this -- red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles, to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode, crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The memory of Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers the front window slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head. Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and toward the surface. ANGLE ON CAMERON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in a desperate race to reach air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the fugitive, the "man on the run." Then, he lifts his head and stops at what he sees before him:

<DIRECTION>

Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready. Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron. ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a-

bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut it!" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away. Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then the jumble of voices is becoming clearer..."No matter what they pay you, make 'em give you a raise!"..."Fantastic, my wife thinks being a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!" It finally sinks in, the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes into laughter. POV

Here comes Chuck, running across the field with his silly stunt bag filled with elastic bandages. How funny. Here's the helicopter hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli, who runs to meet him. How hilarious.
