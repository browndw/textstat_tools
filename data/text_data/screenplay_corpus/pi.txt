INT. MAX'S APARTMENT -CHINATOWN FLAT – NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him-self in the darkness. He has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted, good-looking face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he notices the blood dripping from his nose. Max wipes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max's voiceover begins:

Max's hand as three unmarked, circular pills hit his palm. Then, he slams the pills into the back of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked prescription drugs. He drinks from the sink and splashes a generous amount of water onto his head and face, cleaning his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on his fingertip. Then, he dips his finger under the tap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked out. He flips on his desk lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny ANT crawls across his desk. He looks at it for a moment before getting angry and squashing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which Max flips on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he pops on more lights and more switches. We pull back revealing that Max's apartment looks more like the inside of a computer than a human's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is knee-high in computer parts of all shapes and sizes. The walls are covered with circuit boards. Cables hang from the ceiling like vines in a Brazilian rain forest. They all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is EUCLID, Max's creation. The computer is alive with sounds and lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max works on Euclid with his solder and drill. He cares for the machine as if it were his dream car
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

	Heat's been getting to Euclid. Feel it most in the afternoon when I run the set. Have to keep the fans on all night from now on. Otherwise, everything is running topnotch.

INT. APARTMENJ HALLWAY - DAY

As he secures his apartment, a Young girl named JENNA runs up to him. Her MOM, down the hall, looks apologetic.

Max slaps the RETURN button on his computer.

The phone starts ringing. Max eyes it suspiciously.

Just then, Euclid starts printing results on an old dot- matrix printer.

But before Marcy finishes, Max hangs up. He rips off the printout and heads to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks the peephole, His landlady. MRS. OVADIA, is sweeping the hallway stairs humming a turn-of-the century (the last one, not this one) tune.
</DIRECTION>

Max waits a moment. He tousles his hair. Then he checks again. She's gone. He opens his locks and releases several bolts.

INT.MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

Max locks his front door. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbor, DEVI MINSTRY, a sexy young Indian woman, is just getting home. Max looks away and tries to get his door locked.

Devi pats down his hair. Max is humiliated.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

At the counter, Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he takes three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max flips past a full-page ad in the paper that reads LANCET-PERCY 86% ACCURACY (ONLY GOD IS PERFECT). Max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. He compares stock quotes in the Wall Street Journal against his printout.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>

Max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders his bits and misses.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh sorry, am I bothering you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_FROM_OFFSCREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Max shrugs and looks over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The voice belongs to LENNY MEYER—a bearded man in his late 20s sucking on a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On closer inspection, something is off. It seems that Lenny is an Orthodox Jew. His yarmulke sticks out Slightly from his wide-brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi-tsis hang out from the bottom of his untucked shirt.

Max has no idea what Lenny's talking about. Lenny pulls a leather box with black leather straps from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<LENNY_MEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tefillin. You know Tefillin. I know it looks strange. But it's an amazing tradition that has a tremendous amount of power. It's a mitzvah for all Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs, good deeds, are spiritual food for our hearts and our heads.

And then Max notices that his thumb is twitching He grabs it self-consciously.

In the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. He sees nothing

Then something starts pounding the door. The doorknob quivers, the locks unbolt. The chains are the only thing keeping out the intruder. The door shakes and the chains are strained.

Max notices a SKINNY MAN in a business suit staring at him. The man catches Max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly looks back, making Max turn away.

Suddenly, Max hears someone singing. Max looks up. It is the Skinny Man and he's singing with passion. It's all very strange to Max, who nervously looks away.

Finally, his equally exhausted wife, she's forced to share a bed with this genius, convinces him to take a bath, to relax. While stepping into the tub he observes the bathwater rise as he enters. Displacement. A way to determine volume. And thus, a way to determine density, weight over volume. And thus, Archimedes solves the problem.

INT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER Sol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board.
</DIRECTION>
<SOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe. Although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOL>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOL>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order...a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number.

</MAX>
<SOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is insanity, Max.

	Hold on, you have to slow down. You're losing it, you have to take a breath. Listen to yourself. You're connecting a computer bug I had, a computer bug you might have had, and some religious hogwash. If you want to find the number two sixteen in the world, you'll be able to pull it out of anywhere. Two hundred and sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door. Two hundred and sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator. When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, it will filter everything else out and find examples of that thing everywhere. Three hundred and twenty, four hundred and fifty, twenty-three. Whatever! You've chosen two sixteen and you'll find it everywhere in nature. But Max, as soon as you discard scientific rigor, you are no longer a mathematician. You become a numerologist. What you need to do is take a break from your research. You need it. You deserve it Here's a hundred dollars, I want you to take it. If ,you won't take it, borrow it. Either way, take a break. Spend it however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation. Real world stuff, okay. No math.

<MARCY_DAWSON>

	Good. It's funny, even though we have different aims and different goals we're actually incredibly alike. We both seek the same thing—perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking different types of perfection, but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership. If you let me, I can be your greatest ally. Take the acacia tree...in East Africa. It is the most prevalent plant in all of Kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator, the giraffe. To accomplish this, the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. The tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for shelter, the ants supply defense. When a giraffe starts to eat the tree's leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. The ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe's tongue. The giraffe learns its lesson and never returns. Without each other, the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun Both would die. But with each other, they succeed, they survive, they surpass. They have different aims, different goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max sits on a bench sucking down pills. His head begins to hurt. He touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of pain. He gags several times. Then the pain lets loose and all Max wants to do is die. He smashes the side of his head with his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the tracks on the far platform he sees someone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Max's pain dissipates. His view is obscured by the columns. Max gets up and sees the Young Hasidic Man - from earlier - staring at him. The Man stares at Max without any emotion. Max notices blood dropping from the Man's right hand.

He notices something strange in the shadows. He carefully advances on it. Hiding in the shadows is what looks like a small piece of brain. It seems to be moving slightly.

Max uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it.

Suddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him. Max spins around. Nothing is there but silence.

He turns back to the gray matter. He touches it again. Once again, he hears the deafening HONK HONK. Max spins around, but nothing is there.

	The most I can remember about their significance is from Schneider's class. That bullshit core for majors. Schneider's fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack...but...then again, look at Kepler. He was really into Pythagoras. The leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers. Pythagoras' greatest contribution was the golden ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years, arguably all the way up to today.

Farrouhk tosses Max against the wall. Max whimpers off to his apartment. Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be gives Max a small slap on the butt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He pulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly.

Then, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew characters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several strings of code lightning fast.
</DIRECTION>

The Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical counterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few times—impressed.

<DIRECTION>
Then Max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the black attaché case in front of his door

He gets up and grabs a Ginseng soda from the fridge He drops eight pills in the can. He calmly takes a sip from the soda and places it on the counter.

He grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve. He can't get it to roll up. Suddenly he's overwhelmed by pain. He quickly rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm.

Nothing happens. He checks the barrel—its empty

He grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the sink.

He cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles. He loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. A wave of pain and nausea floods in. He grabs another bottle and fires it into his arm. Then he fires another and another.

Frustrated he collapses into the mirror.

<DIRECTION>
So he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their screams carry into Max's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side of his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He examines it in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it!? What is it!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max can barely stand it. A jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he vomits blood into the sink. He starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs his head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted and agonizing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, where the pain is coming from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the pain is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He gets to his feet and head's into Euclid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A filo substance billows out of Euclid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a number pops onto the screen. Max estimates how many digits are on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it!

Max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing down the number. He mumbles each digit as he sees it.

But then be stops writing. Power surge! He stares at the number. Something clicks in his head. His eyes go wide. He barely musters a—

<RAV_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Romans also murdered all of our priest- hood—the Cohanim—the Cohens, and with their deaths they destroyed our greatest secret. In the center of the great temple was the holy of holies which was the heart of Jewish life. This was the earthly residence for our God. The one God. It contained the ark of the Tabernacle which stored the original Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses. Only one man could enter this space once a year on the holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur On the Day of Atonement, all of Israel would descend upon Jerusalem to witness the High Cohen's trip into the holy of holies. If the holy man was pure he would reemerge a few moments later and Israel was secured a prosperous year. It meant that we were one yea r closer to the messianic age. Closer to the return of the Garden of Eden. But if he was impure, he would die instantly and it meant that we were doomed. The High Cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy of holies. He had to intone a single word.

	Yes...it's The key into the messianic age. As the Romans burned the temple, the Talmud says, the High Cohen walked into the flames. He took his secret to the top of the burning building.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a number. I'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen number. You've translated all of them. You've intoned them all. Haven't you? But what's it gotten you? It's not the number! It's the meaning. It's the syntax. It's what's between the numbers. If you could understand you would. But it's not for you! I've got it. I understand it. I'm going to see it!

People fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind.

EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful woman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON and she is Sol's niece.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNY_ROBESON>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P, research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of retirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a piece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is THE number. Max slides it into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks at the Go board. The pieces are arranged in a giant spiral across the board.

INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max sits on his bed staring at Sol's handwritten number. Then he notices that his thumb is twitching. He drops Sol's note.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He dumps the contents of the bottle of pills into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat. He looks at the pills. Then he looks at Euclid around him. He throws the pills and the bottle to the floor. They fall to earth in SLOW MOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room rushes in on Max and so does the pain. It throws him to the ground and he bashes his head against the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(Courageously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. I'm ready. I'm ready! Show me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The pain rips apart his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks Euclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three, seven, two...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool through the mainframe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard covering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the entire window wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight floods the room and throws Max into the BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone. Everything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases from his brow and his shoulders sag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender and peaceful. As he starts to become part of the void, his voice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears Devi.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max. Max! Are you okay!? Oh my God, Max!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice reaches into the void.

<DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks toward her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Max. Listen to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
We cut back to ...THE MAIN ROOM where Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he continues to recite the number.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breathe, Max! Breathe. Focus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
Max turns away from Devi and we return to the BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max continues to recite the number.
</DIRECTION>
<DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Max. No. Stay with me Max. Stay with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
And then we cut back to THE MAIN ROOM where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her hand. We return to THE BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his fear filled eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I? What is this? This is wrong, Sol. Sol!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match cut back to THE MAIN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as he collapses into her arms, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sol! You were right Sol! He was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DEVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right Max. That's Right. Breathe. Breathe.

</DEVI>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was right. I want to breathe. Breathe.

</MAX>
<DEVI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, breathe, Max. Breathe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEVI>
<DIRECTION>
Max sobs. He holds onto her for dear life
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is holding onto himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the number. He collects himself and catches his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAX'S BATHROOM – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, he prepares something in the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at himself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max lifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit against the math section of his scalp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He applies pressure and drills into his brain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max collapses as we quickly CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

He listens to the wind in the trees.

</JENNA>
<DIRECTION>
Jenna types m the number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max is about to say "no" to Jenna, but then be decides to give it a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max thinks, he really thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenna presses the EQUALS button.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNA>
