EXT. JET CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battered JET CAR, exhausting smoke, Buckaroo rolling its window down, opening the door and emerging, checking the damage to his vehicle, noting a STRANGE GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE on the cracked windshield, touching it and turning his nose from the smell...his glove steaming!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEWS COPTER LANDING IN THE DISTANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON Buckaroo as he lowers himself under the Jet Car, coming face- to-face with one ugly SPHERICAL PARASITE, THE THING SUDDENLY SHOOTING OUT at Buckaroo as he's about to touch it...A MOBILE PHONE starting to BEEP back in the cockpit...the PARASITE coming to rest on the ground...dead?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a room in an insane asylum, a room designed for several inmates but occupied by only one, this crazy old fiend...the empty beds piled with books and Italian memorabilia, the walls covered with mathematical equations...

So I gotta ask, did it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the BJV, the experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack into a black void?

BACK TO Dr. Lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor, and HIS LEFT AHND, ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS RIGHT, ERASES THE EQUATION HE'S JUST WRITTEN...as his right hand reaches under his pillow and picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET...a piece of metal wrapped in copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo now attaches directly to his thumbs...

INT. STRANGE LABORATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forty-six years prior (years before the ill-fated primitive speed car run involving Buckaroo's parents) an unlikely experiment in a strange factory...A RUNWAY...a much younger, dark-haired Doctor Lizardo being strapped into a homemade wicker chair/rocket sled by two LAB ASSISTANTS, the entire contraption set up like a catapult AIMED DIRECTLY AT A LOSID BRICK WALL, THROBBING ELECTROMAGNETS AND BANKS OF GLOWING OSCILLATORS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE...and peering into an unusual periscope, an equally JUVENILE PROFESSOR HIKITA wearing glasses and scraggly goatee...standing in front of a 1938 calendar on the wall, today's eagerly awaited date circled in red...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE END OF THE TRACK...the strange device coming to an abrupt and total stop ten feet from the brick wall, pitching Lizardo forward and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...through the wall, at least partially, the seemingly solid bricks turning out to be more like vertical QUICKSAND...Lizardo half in, half out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PERISCOPE POV: HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN AURA OF ELECTRICITY TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM...ONE CREATURE IN PARTICULAR ENVELOPING LIZARDO!

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO...the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, dragging him back into the room only to find this SUDDENLY ORANGE- HAIRED LIZARDO a fearsome, changed individual...a beast!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LIZARDO! A terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway! Hikita watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy expanse of the factory...
</DIRECTION>

A DISTANT VIEW OF LIZARDO as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping into the night, SILHOUTTED AGAINST A DAZZLING SECURITY LIGHT, THE SCREEN BURNING WHITE...OUR FLASHBACK ENDING.

INT. LIZARDO'S ROOM - NIGHT

Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance of a GUARD who comes in and unplugs his TV set.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday. I come for your TV. You been using too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month. Beats me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power.

</GUARD>

The guard leaving with Lizardo's TV...Lizardo trying to control himself, his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another UNUSUAL EQUATION has been scrawled in an angry hand.

Backstage in a small dressing room, the rock band known as the Hong Kong Cavaliers waits to go on...three unidentified GROUPIES in attendance as Rawhide naps and Reno tunes his saxophone while Perfect Tommy answers the questions of a FEMALE REPORTER from the local underground press...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Professor Hikita meantime at a corner table, studying his big notebook, examining a pair of KODAK SLIDES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor, EXCITED VOICES and FOOT TRAFFIC coming this way, Rawhide methodically counting down under his Stetson:
</DIRECTION>
<RAWHIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five...four...three...two...one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAWHIDE>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one, admitting an out-of-breath and hastily tuxedoed Buckaroo Banzai, A SMALL CROWD OF ASSORTED FEMAL FANS locked outside.

LIGHTS UP! AND A WAVE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK 'N' ROLL CRASHES OUT ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY...crying, for some reason exempt from the general raucous good will. She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do the job. She's all alone. She needs some help. Her name is PENNY PRIDDY.
</DIRECTION>

On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves the Cavaliers to cease as well. EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike.

For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers...

Penny lays both publications on the table, continues to dig around, revealing next a SHINY SMALL-CALIBER AUTOMATIC PISTOL...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with Doctor Emilio Lizardo.

	Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.

</SECRETARY_OF_DEFENSE>
<BUCKAROO_BANZAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables. And mountains.

	Buckaroo, the President's on line on. Calling about is everything okay with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead and destroy Russia...?

INT. BEDROOM/BUS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buckaroo reaching his private quarters, finding Penny on his cot, a sheet pulled over her face...ethereal morning light caressing her still body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Buckaroo distraught, pulling the sheet back to reveal Penny in final repose, speckled with dead ants, honey and powdery white insecticide... Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both hands...SPARKS...
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKAROO_BANZAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Penny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKAROO_BANZAI>
<DIRECTION>
...shaking her, exhorting her...
</DIRECTION>
<BUCKAROO_BANZAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open your eyes! Look at me! Penny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUCKAROO_BANZAI>
<DIRECTION>
...but nothing, no more signs of life...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the fire of life as Penny opens her eyes, sees her haggard hero before her.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY_PRIDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buckaroo...you look awful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_PRIDDY>
<DIRECTION>
And indeed they both do, but who cares? ANOTHER GALVANIC KISS, CRACKLING GOOD as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent thing...IRIS OUT...as CREDITS ROLL and the FANTASTIC VOICE OF Dr. Buckaroo Banzai serenades us home...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the Hong Kong Cavaliers harmonizing like honey, the world once again a safe, snug harbor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
