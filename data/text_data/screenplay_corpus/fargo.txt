A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing something in the mirror.

</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Both cars have stopped. Carl looks up at the rear-view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the trooper's door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I help you, officer?
	</DIALOGUE>

The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty- dollar bill protruding from it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<TROOPER>

</TROOPER>

</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>

The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold and hands the billfold back into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put that back in your pocket, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROOPER>
<DIRECTION>
Carl's nervous smile fades.
</DIRECTION>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TROOPER>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a whimpering sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policeman hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair and slams his head down onto the car door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment. He brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG - into the back of the trooper's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean screams.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIMSRUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIMSRUD>
<DIRECTION>
He releases the policeman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policeman's head slides out the window and his body flops back onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl looks out at the cop in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa... Whoa, Daddy.

Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails it out the open window.

Jean, for some reason, screams again. Then stops.
</DIRECTION>

The car approaches, slowing.

Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in the headlights.

The car accelerates and roars past and away. We just make out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat. He squeals into a U- turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead. The pursued car churns up fine snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray. We hear the churning of the car wheels and the pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red tail lights ahead start to turn. With a distant crunching sound, they disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud frowns and slows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his door and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway. A young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy. He raises his gun and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back and he pitches into the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.
</DIRECTION>

Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.

A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland. The room in which it hangs is dark. We hear off-screen snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half- completed oil of a grey mallard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping. The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied. His mouth is agape. He snores. His arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and snoring.

The phone rings.

	Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know? Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.

Marge stares.

After a long moment her stare breaks. She glances idly around the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a framed picture facing away from her on the desktop. She turns it to face her. It is Scotty, holding an accordion. There is another picture of Jean.

Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.

She fiddles idly with a pencil. She pulls a clipboard toward her. It holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation.

She looks idly around. Her look abruptly locks.

He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and diffused by snow. The audio crackles with interference. Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds Grimsrud's complete attention.

At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.

:SC: ROAD EXTERIOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin. She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur- lined hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of the power tool. Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the grinding noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roar grows louder. Marge stands panting by one tree, her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood. She squints down toward the cabin's back lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a large power tool which his body blocks from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge advances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is forcing downward something which engages the roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears. His breath steams as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roar is very loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge's eyes shift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud works on, eyes watering. With a grunt he bends down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log. He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge is advancing. She holds a gun extended toward Grimsrud, who is still turned away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge closes in, grimacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log that pushes down into the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of Carl Showalter's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge has drawn to within twenty yards. When she bellows it sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the roar of the power tool.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Police! Turn around and hands up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Grimsrud scowls. He turns to face her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge bellows again:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hands up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at Marge and then starts running away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands in the snow several feet short of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Halt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
She fires in the air.

She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
She fires again.

<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud pitches forward. He mutters in Swedish as he reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with a snap of the wrist.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At length:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And those three people in Brainerd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And for what? For a little bit of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear distant sirens.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... There's more to life than money, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances up in the rear-view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Don't you know that?... And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sirens are getting louder. Marge pulls over.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling WHOOPS on her siren.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on her flashers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares forward, shakes her head. We hear the dull click of her flashers.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I just don't unnerstand it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Outside it is snowing. The sky, the earth, the road - all white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white. It approaches in slow motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ambulance punches through after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another squad car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain. One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms. One of them raps at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Anderson...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
A title fades in: OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a pause, muffled through the door:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Who?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy 88 out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_ONE>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Just a sec.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you open the door, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_ONE>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Yah. Yah, just a sec.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a clatter from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Just a sec...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys. This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dale!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short, piercing screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing continues. The policemen struggle to restrain him.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call an ambulance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_ONE>
<COP_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got him okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_TWO>
<DIRECTION>
Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts into uncontrolled sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<COP_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yah, yah, call an ambulance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry sobs and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: A BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and climbs into bed, with some effort.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooph!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They announced it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
Marge looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They announced it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay fixed on the television.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three-cent stamp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mallard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Norm, that's terrific!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just the three cent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's terrific!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yah, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's terrific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes go back to the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm so proud a you, Norm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Norm murmurs:
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Margie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Norm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest a hand on top of her stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Two more months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two more months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGE>
<DIRECTION>
Hold; fade out.
</DIRECTION>
