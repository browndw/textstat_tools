INT. C-130 HERCULES TURBO-PROP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black, jump packs and combat gear, stare down the deep end of a greasy ramp into the night sky. Village lights flicker 19,000 feet below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness and plummet toward earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner of the large estate toting an AK-47.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a beat, the red dot seems to bleed. The Guard collapses dead. Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.
</DIRECTION>

Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches his assault troops as they take positions.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - NIGHT

The team kicks open a door. Rushes into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM -

Assault weapons pointed at the bed. The soldiers yank back bedsheets to reveal IVAN STRAVANAVITCH, a middle-aged man and his half-naked 18-year-old concubine.

The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING - As they push down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades. Exploding everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position. The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing. They open fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck. He's' pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts into the sky, its guns spitting lead...

Hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round banquet tables. A HUSH falls over the guests as the DINGING continues. All attention turns to the front table.
</DIRECTION>

A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium microphone. He is STOLI PETROV, President of Russia.

</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FRONT TABLE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man in his mid-forties. Worry lines crease his forehead and the touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult years in office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. He busily makes last minute changes to his speech.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSLATOR>

</TRANSLATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...
</DIRECTION>
<DOHERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should consider running him for re-election instead of the U.S.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOHERTY>
<DIRECTION>
The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
(in Russian with subtitles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening and thank you. First I would ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the Turkmenistan massacres.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
The room remains silent a few beats. Most guests respectfully bow their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall begins again, but this time in English. The young woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you know, three weeks ago American Special Forces, in cooperation with the Russian Republican Army, secured the arrest of Turkmenistan's self- proclaimed dictator, General Ivan Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic reign had given new meaning to the word horror. I am proud to say our operation was a success.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
Applause from the audience. Marshall turns the page on his speech.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now, yesterday's biggest threat to world peace... today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, folds it and slides it into his pocket. He removes his glasses and looks out into the crowd. His tone becomes more personal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's not reciting the speech anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we did here was important. We finally pulled our heads out of the sand, we finally stood up to the brutality and said "We've had enough. Every time we ignore these atrocities-- the rapes, the death squads, the genocides- every time we negotiate with these, these thugs to keep them out of gig country and away from gig families, every time we do thiS.E. we legitimize terror. Terror is not a legitimate system of government. And to those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid.

Applause rolls through the crowd.

The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff, including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL handcuffed to his wrist. In the b.g. on the limo's television set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.

	Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<SHEPHERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.

<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might still have a few chips left.

	Criminal. One of our boys died in Marshall's little publicity stunt and for what? So we could claim victory over another country's problems instead of our own? And now he's got the nerve to prance around Moscow gloating, while that poor boy's family is left to bury him. If I were Marshall, I'd be ashamed of myself.
	</DIALOGUE>

Marshall mutes the television. A quiet moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPHERD>

Marshall considers. Then decides.

	It's bait. Don't take it.

	Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.

Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.

He emerges into the bowels of Air Force one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands quietly a moment, listening... for footsteps, for gunfire. All quiet except for the whine of the jet engines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tak9s a moment to think. Considers his situation. His eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could make it to the pod. He trots down the gangway toward the lower galley.

The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in disgust.

He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays it on a table.

Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling through his wardrobe.

Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beep... Beep... Beep...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall's watch alarm goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad continues to the staff Cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any medical emergency the president might encounter.
</DIRECTION>

But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<VLAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on the floor, now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VLAD>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his head. Recognizes him.

</MARSHALL>
<DIRECTION>
He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, swirling into the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...
</DIRECTION>

Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERNEATH A CABINET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing at the tube.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON. LOW-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pitched hum and beeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his grip just for a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beeping becomes a steady whine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side of Vlad's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end. then he collapses to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.

Just as the terrorists descend, Marshall squeezes off a few rounds. The terrorists edge back up the steps, returning fire.

Marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. He fires off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some gauze.

The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the stairs to take position.

He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.
