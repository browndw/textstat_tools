EFFECT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In complete silence the silhouetted grey shadow of a baseball player at bat fills the screen. The background is a tone of black. The player stands motionless for a few seconds and then commences waggling his bat as if preparing to hit. Since he is a right handed hitter he stands front to audience and watching for the ball to come from his left. Slowly he ends his waggling by pulling his bat way back, stands thus posed a moment... then swings hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly we hear the familiar crack of bat against ball. Almost simultaneously there is the roar of a baseball crowd, our music comes in, and our picture title, THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORY, hits the screen. Now, as subtitles appear, they show against a continuation of other baseball scenes in silhouette: a figure running, sliding, jumping for a high ball, throwing, etc. With the end of the titles we

<NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1919 American professional baseball, slowed down by World War I, was picking up speed again. It had its Babe Ruth who was astounding the country by hitting 29 homers for Boston, its Ty Cobb then winding up a Hall of Fame career by leading the American League in hitting with a .384 average, Ty's great contemporary in Cleveland, Tris Speaker, its great pitchers, Walter Johnson, Burleigh Grimes, Herb Pennock... And, down in Georgia, it had something else... coming up. Name? Jackie Robinson. Race? Negro. Occupation? Infant in his mother's arms.

Holding the reins is an old Negro in well-worn, farmhand clothes. Beside him on the seat and holding a sleeping baby in her arms is a Negro woman, about thirty. She is dressed in the best that a poor woman of her time and place might be able to afford -- a store suit, but re-tailored to fit, and neatly pressed. Between them sits a two year old girl, also in her starched best. Behind, standing and sitting amidst some cheap suitcases, are three other children, two boys and a girl, from four to ten years of age.

	<DIALOGUE>
	In the family history of every living American, except for the American Indian, there is the story of migration and settling and re- settling. Either the American himself, or an ancestor, had to travel to get where that American is today. Jackie Robinson was raised in Pasadena, California. This is how his mother, a widow, brought him and his brothers and sisters out of Georgia.

The mother and her brood are asleep. She is against the window, the baby still in her arms, and her head fallen back against the headrest. Alongside her is curled the two-year old girl. Half-sitting, half-slumped against each other on the seat opposite are the next two youngest children, and lying on blankets on the floor between the seats is cramped the oldest child. Once, as the narrator talks, the mother opens her eyes slowly, looks her children over, makes a slight re-adjustment of position here and there among them, then lets her head fall back again.

Jackie nods. Neither of them is at all bitter about it. It is just accepted.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>

	Sure... I know... But I've got to go to work. I want to marry Rae. School's one thing -- but you and Mom can't support me in marriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
During the scene, Mack has continued to eat and now he opens the thermos of coffee. Jackie shakes his head that he doesn't want any and Mack pours himself a cup. As he starts to drink, a convertible filled with young people drives in sight, the youngsters singing a football victory song. Jackie and Mack watch it drive by. Banners and streamers hang from the car -- all showing UCLA insignia.

Mack grins at Jackie.

He's walking out of here without anything ahead of him except a couple of games of pro-football signed up.

JACKIE - SUKEFORTH CLOSE TWO SHOT

Jackie is bewildered. He looks towards Sukeforth as if for help in understanding but Sukeforth's expression is just as puzzled. Then Jackie turns back and his face hardens a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said that as if you were talking about organized baseball, Mr. Rickey. But I'm a Negro. There are none of us in big league ball. I don't understand...

Leaning forward to Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been looking for someone like you -- an intelligent, educated, good Negro ballplayer -- for some time. I needed a man whose character was well regarded and whose background was unblemished. As far as we can find out, you are such a man. You might as well know now... we've done a lot of checking up on you. I can tell you your life story from Georgia to where you are sitting now. It may be that you will be the first Negro in organized baseball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
JACKIE CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is flabbergasted and, at the same time, beginning to feel an excitement which he cannot well hide. But he is also puzzled, and his hand goes to his chest, indicating himself, as he manages to get out one word...

	But...

DESK AREA THREE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rickey stands up and shoots a finger out at Jackie as if guessing what is on his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you? Let's get this straight so we can all understand it. It's too important for anyone to have a false impression. People are going to shoot at us... we must know where we stand. I didn't call you here because I want to do something for you, or for your race, or for the Brooklyn Ball Club. I want to do something for all of us... All of us Americans.

Rickey turns and gazes out of the window.

<DIRECTION>
BASEBALL CROWDS - ANY PARK - (STOCK) MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selected to illustrate Rickey's continued speech. (Great care should be taken here as the proper scenes can lend pointed and heartwarming emphasis to this important, key scene. We see Negroes and Whites laughing together, growing tense together, gulping with relief as some emergency is met. We may have a group CLOSEUP which might include (this may have to be staged) an American executive type, a Negro and a Jew, suddenly all filled with heartbreak or dismay as a hometown hero has apparently struck out, or some other bad break has ensued. In no case need we show what they are watching. The faces of the crowds can express the typical emotional situations that come up in any game.)
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Italians, Irish, Swedes, Jews, Germans, Chinese, Russians, Japanese, Czechs... and I have marveled at their fellowship, their cheers, laughter, disappointments, enthusiasm, all as one... and all made so by the magic of a sport they all loved and appreciated equally. And I couldn't help ask myself a question... a long time ago... and hundreds of times since -- If Americans can find such a common meeting ground in a game... the game of baseball... If they can play together like this... why can't they live together like this... in the game of life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
OFFICE MED.

<DIRECTION>
Over heads of Jackie and Sukeforth towards Rickey still looking out of window. He turns back and finishes quietly.

JACKIE - SUKEFORTH TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sukeforth looks to see what Jackie's answer will be, and Jackie begins nodding slowly, and replies, not as if he is talking to Rickey, but as if he is asking questions of himself... because this is serious.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm strong enough. If I should be the one on whom this all depends.

RICKEY - JACKIE TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY>

(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That should be enough. But I want you to know exactly what you are getting into. I'll do my part. You mustn't let me, or all of us, down. Jackie, we can't start you with Brooklyn. It wouldn't be fair to both of us. We don't know if you're major league or not.

</RICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
JACKIE CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. He agrees.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll let you try out for Montreal, one of our farm teams, and later hope you make Brooklyn. But aside from that, if and when we announce you for even Montreal... do you know what's going to happen? The papers? People? Other players? Other clubs? The reaction in the south?

Both Rickey and Sukeforth wait for Jackie's reply. Finally it comes.

RICKEY CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a poser. He rubs his face, his chin, and practically his entire head. Eventually he finds an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what's going to make your job so tough. No! I want a fighter every time. I want a man in there for everything he's got! But... you'll have to take it... not fight back... and yet, do it so that somehow it's no discredit to you... so that somehow the crowd will sense it's not cowardice that is stopping you but something deeper. If, and when, you can put that over... your troubles are over. No player will bother you, no man will unfairly attack you by name or epithet, when you have established that with the baseball public. Because the very core of Americans is fair play... once they have felt the true situation involved.

RICKEY - JACKIE TWO SHOT

Rickey stands up. Jackie follows.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie, I know from your background that you've been spiked and beaned in baseball, you've been clipped and two-way tackled in football, you've been banged around on the street. That's what you face now. And you don't dare yell copper... or fight back. You don't dare because more than you... much more than just you... hangs in the balance.

	Oh, not actually... but it could be nasty... you know. But he's got to promise not to fight back no matter what happens to him and he don't know if he can trust himself to take it.

HARLEM - (STOCK) EFFECT SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This scene, which is one of the most important in the picture, will depend almost entirely on footage available, editorial selection of scenes, and technical handling. We see Harlem at night and get the feeling of humanity so congested, and sometimes so suppressed, that it overruns its boundaries both physically and emotionally. Yet there is also the music and laughter of Harlem, and the spirit of a people not to be overcome. Song and violence, rowdy kids and sober elders, church and saloon, and always the streets crowded, the buildings giving an appearance of being stuffed. Intercut in these scenes are the minister and Jackie, so that they appear to be looking on and absorbing what they see. Occasionally the minister will glance at Jackie to make sure he is taking it all in. Occasionally he will explain what is going on... and the dialogue for this is to be written when the proper scenes are selected.

</RAE>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure. I'm very sure. Not afraid, are you?... because of all this fuss in the papers? I've never been south either, since babyhood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little. But that's not why I wonder about coming. I just don't want to be in your way. You'll be busy with all that spring training... people wanting to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who'll want to talk to me? They talk about me... but not to me much. If you aren't there I'll just be alone once I'm off the field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the way you figure it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<JACKIE>

<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why... we were going to find a hotel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no suitable hotel, Mr. Robinson. That's why we talked it over. I'd be pleased to have you stop at my home while you are here as our guests. Such as it is, it is the only place available.

</GAINES>
<JACKIE>

(puzzled, looking at Rae)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very kind of you... but... why... we don't want to impose...

<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. You are a very important man to us. It will be our pleasure, I assure you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jackie studies Gaines a moment and then understands. He extends his hand and both men shake.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY FULL
</DIRECTION>

A car pulls up outside a comfortable looking frame house. The three, Gains, Jackie and Rae, get out, the two men dividing the bags between them, and walk towards house. As they get near the door, it opens and a dignified colored woman steps out and smiles a welcome. From a distance we see the introductions made and the group passes inside.

GAINES' CAR - (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>

We see Jackie and Gaines in car as it comes to stop near field which forms the b.g. Jackie, carrying small zipper bag, emerges from car, waves thanks to Gaines, and starts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY FULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie is buttoning up his uniform and nearly a dozen reporters, most of them white, are shooting questions at him. Several have notebooks in their hands and are writing down his answers.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Think you're good enough to make the Dodgers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know if I'm good enough to make the Montreal team -- so I'm not even thinking about the Dodgers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<2ND_REPORTER>

	Same as you would. Duck.

The other reporters grin.
</DIRECTION>
<3RD_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hope to be a Dodger sometime, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</3RD_REPORTER>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure -- provided I'm good enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<4TH_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the other players? You think there'll be any trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</4TH_REPORTER>
<JACKIE>

(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trouble?

</JACKIE>
<2ND_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He means -- do you expect to get along with the other guys --- Suppose something happens -- then what? How'll it affect you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</2ND_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie doesn't answer for a moment. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sincerely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too tough for me to answer. All I can say is that I'm going to do my best -- as a player and on and off the field... How it'll turn out -- I don't know any more than you do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
A few start writing this down and now the trainer moves up in front of Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, boys -- but you'll have to continue this later -- right now Robinson's due on the field...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINER>
<DIRECTION>
The reporters understand and several move to follow Jackie as he and the trainer exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUGOUT - DAY MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jackie, the trainer, and several reporters come up out of it and stand there for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAYING FIELD - FULL SHOT - THEIR ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Showing ballplayers, some batting, fielding, throwing balls, etc. o.s., we hear the trainer's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Hopper!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
At the call, a tall, greying man in his fifties, in uniform, turns around and walks toward Jackie and others, including camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - JACKIE, TRAINER, REPORTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mr. Hopper walks into scene and up to them.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie -- this is Mr. Hopper -- Manager of the Montreal Royals -- Mr. Hopper -- Jackie Robinson...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINER>
<DIRECTION>
They both nod and shake hands. Hopper is a hard man to figure out. His accent is Southern -- his attitude calm and quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a few minutes for us, Mr. Hopper...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<HOPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly -- but let me get Jackie out there first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOPPER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts moving toward the field as he speaks and Jackie follows him. Then they both stop and look out toward the playing field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - FROM THEIR ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost every player on the field is looking in their direction, curious about Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - HOPPER AND JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Hopper moves forward again. Jackie is a bit nervous and we can tell that Hopper knows how he feels, but there are no words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING - HOPPER AND JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they move down the first base line toward a player who is tossing a ball with two other men who are standing as a pair some distance away.
</DIRECTION>
<HOPPER>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boys... this is Jackie Robinson.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jackie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Harker, Billings and Piletti. Catch with them a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOPPER>
<DIRECTION>
The players and Jackie nod. Hopper turns away and Jackie joins Harker who is the lone player, with Billings and Piletti some sixty feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We ANGLE SEVERAL SHOTS while the following routine takes place. Piletti throws the ball to Harker who is alongside Jackie. Harker throws it back to Billings. Billings should throw now to Jackie -- instead he also throws to Harker. They keep this up a while, with Piletti and Billings never throwing to Jackie, just to Harker, and as it goes on and the white men realize they have committed themselves to this insult, their faces sharpen, the atmosphere becomes a little tense as indicated by the quick glances they shoot each other and the way they avoid even looking at Jackie. It is his first crisis, a childish one, perhaps, but nevertheless serious. He stands quietly, his face betraying nothing, but his eyes just following the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he studies their faces, his eyes following the ball in flight. He hopes they might be kidding him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS - CLOSEUPS - THREE PLAYERS' FACES FROM JACKIE'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their faces serious. It is not a gag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out toward other players on field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLAYING FIELD FULL SHOT - JACKIE'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several players, including Clay Hopper, who has turned around, are watching with interest, paying no attention to their own practice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSEUP - JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is troubled, not knowing what to do, but realizing that he must do something -- yet nothing that will offend the three players who are still ignoring him. He studies them again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING SHOT - THE THREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STUDIES their faces for a brief moment. We even feel that they are sorry they have done what they have, but they don't know how to get out of it without one of them turning "chicken."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a breath and moves a step closer to Harker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piletti throws again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACKIE - HARKER CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball is again intended for Harker but Jackie leans over and casually gathers it in in a graceful catch. Before there can be any reaction he has the ball on its way back to Billings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLINGS - PILETTI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billings is so unnerved by the whole incident that he fumbles the ball and has to walk after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACKIE - HARKER CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie turns after throw to find Harker looking at him almost gratefully. Harker nods in commendation.
</DIRECTION>
<HARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad you did that. I don't know how the heck we got into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARKER>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billings has recovered ball and is so confused by the whole episode that, instead of throwing it back to Harker, who is extending a glove up in the air as a sign, he throws it to Jackie instead. Harker watches and looks back at Billings. Then he calls out in pretended indignation.
</DIRECTION>
<HARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, great! Now you're leaving me out of it! Oh, fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARKER>
<DIRECTION>
The four of them have to laugh now and as we cut away Harker is begging Jackie for the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<HARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here... let me get a chance to throw once in a while!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARKER>
<DIRECTION>
HOPPER CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face inscrutable, he turns and studies the faces of the other ballplayers who have been watching the incident. They, too, are smiling. Thoughtfully, he walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAINES HOME FULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see two women seated on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae and Mrs. Gaines are talking.

	Well... not yet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.

<DIRECTION>
(studying Rae)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not nervous about it, are you? Afraid down here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GAINES>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... to tell you the truth, I wouldn't be comfortable. I've never been south and I'm afraid I wouldn't know how to act. You probably don't understand but... when one isn't accustomed to... well, sort of deferring... or whatever it is down here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(helplessly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I'm not clear. Perhaps if you explained. I worry about making a mistake and getting Jackie into trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<MRS_GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. Of course I do. But it really isn't as bad as reported. Some of what you hear is true... a lot exaggerated. We live our own lives... and as long as we live our own lives we are not bothered. Most of the white people understand our position and are helping, bit by bit, to make things better, easier. We've got to show respect for all of them -- whether we respect them or not. Always say Mister or Mrs. -- never use first names, even if they ask you to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of those are hard to do, really. You do defer, but even that isn't hard -- once you get used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GAINES>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<MRS_GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every way. In stores, say, don't try to get waited on until you're the only one left -- and give way even if you're first and they come in later... Never, of course, try or expect to mix --- and as long as they come first in everything -- you'll get along all right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
Rae is thoughtful for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me -- why are you living here -- instead of up North...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<MRS_GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To tell you the truth, I like it down here. Even so... I like it down here. If I left... it would be like running away from home. I couldn't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GAINES>
<RAE>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it, too. It feels like home... and yet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<MRS_GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet it's strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GAINES>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Strange. Almost... mysterious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Haines nods in understanding. The two sit silently as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EFFECT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We get a synoptic impression of activities: Jackie training, a class being instructed in base sliding, Jackie, Rae, Mr. and Mrs. Gaines around a card table at home, and, at the end, a shot showing a group of white Floridians standing in silence, watching Jackie taking part in a scrub game.

	Then... you mean I'm through? Is that what he said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GAINES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	By myself? I don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. With the others. Mr. Rickey's answer to the town was to decide to move the whole Brooklyn organization out of here to another town. Not far. You'll still stay here with us.

INT. BALL PARK - DAY FULL SHOT

Training session on. A few dozen players on the field, catching, throwing, batting, etc. Jackie is playing shortstop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - THE FIELD FOCUSED ON PITCHER AND BATTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A batter misses the first pitch, then connects on the second and runs for first. Jackie scoops up the ball but makes a very bad throw to first -- and the batter is safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE - JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking disgusted with himself, then flexes his right arm a few times as he moves back into position.

GROUP SHOT - RICKEY AND REPORTERS

The cynical reporter grimaces at Jackie's performance.

<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From what I've heard, you had a good ballplayer in Robinson. But from what I've seen -- you've wasted your time --

(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and mine, too...
	</DIALOGUE>

The other two reporters show nothing. Rickey isn't bothered.

The reporters think about this, but the cynic isn't impressed.

Scoreboard reads: 1 to 1 -- 2nd Inning. Fans seem to be enjoying the game. The batter scores an out and the teams change sides as we HOLD. The Royals are coming to bat.

EXT. PLAYERS BENCH DUGOUT IN B.G.

A player selects a bat and moves to take up his position at the plate as the pitcher and catcher warm up. Hopper motions to Jackie who steps forward and picks out his own bat.

SPECIAL SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this point we go into a special sequence which must be worked out at time of shooting between Jackie and the director. It is designed as a demonstration of what makes a good ball player as illustrated by Jackie... with Rickey commenting on him for the benefit of the two reporters. The action is not confined to any one inning but spreads over the entire game in montaged scenes that take in his hitting, funning and fielding. It should end up a memorable sequence for all who play or enjoy baseball and believe, usually wrongly, that they know all its tricks, embracing not only physical skill but headwork as well. When it is over the entire audience must have a knowledge and appreciation of what makes Jackie Robinson the player he is... and, furthermore, a better knowledge of baseball itself.

	I'll give it to you. Jackie... you are now officially a Montreal Royal. You have made the team. Okay?

Jackie, who has been sitting a bit dejectedly, straightens up slowly and looks from one to the other. His face is filled more with wonder than anything else.

He seems lost in thought, his gaze directed at a far corner of the room, as Rickey gives him a farewell pat on the shoulder and exits. Jackie doesn't even look up. Then Hopper is standing over him.

Receives ball from second baseman in disgust and turns around towards plate. Only once, before throwing, does he turn around to eye Jackie, then he starts his windup. The second he goes into it there is a roar from the crowd and we can tell from the frantic look that comes into the pitcher's eyes that he knows what is happening -- Jackie must be off again... this time for third!

Taking in Jackie and the pitcher, the former dancing away from third distractingly and the latter plainly worried by Jackie's tactics and snapping a couple of throws to third in an effort to trap him off base.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...With the baseball season almost over, Jackie Robinson has proved himself one of the standout players in the International League. In his home town, Montreal, he is a hero. To the great majority of fans in other International League towns, he is also a favorite. There's no doubt of it. Jackie has made good here... but the biggest hurdle is ahead of him... the major league. The opposition is strengthening. There are going to be fireworks!

	Jackie, your team begins a seven game practice series against Brooklyn today. I want you to play first. I want you to play like you've never played before. Last year at Montreal doesn't mean a thing. This is it. This is where you decide whether Brooklyn wants you... and by Brooklyn I don't mean me -- I mean the Brooklyn players. I want you to run them ragged, on the bases, in the field, at bat. Run wild. Steal their pants off. They know they are definitely weak at first. They want to win the pennant. Make them wonder if their chances wouldn't be better if they had you. If they wonder loud enough... I'll get you for them.

Jackie still has a fielder's glove on his hand. Slowly he shakes it off and puts the first baseman's glove on instead. He seems to have forgotten that Rickey is there. He pounds his fist into the pocket of the glove thoughtfully and then, without another word, still deeply preoccupied apparently, walks off. Rickey's gaze follows him.

	Today, ladies and gentleman, near the close of the 1949 baseball season, a great National League player, and outstanding American citizen, is on his way to Washington. His name is Jackie Robinson. He isn't going there to play ball. But he is going to talk about how an American patriot plays ball with the country that extends him the right to fight for freedom. He has been asked to discuss the patriotism of the American Negro... before the members of the Un-American Activities Committee.

<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can put me down as an expert on being a colored American, with thirty years of experience at it. And just like any other colored person with sense enough to look around him and understand what he sees, I know that life in these United States can be mighty tough for people who are a little different from the majority -- in their skin, color or the way they worship their God, or the way they spell their names. I'm not fooled because I've had a chance open to very few Negro Americans. It's true that I've been the laboratory specimen in a great change in organized baseball. I'm proud that I've made good on my assignment to the point where other colored players will find it easier to enter the game and go to the top. But I'm very well aware that even this limited job isn't finished. As I see it there has been a terrific lot of misunderstanding on this subject of communism among Negroes in this country, and it's bound to hurt my people's cause unless it's cleared up. I understand that there are some few Negroes who are members of the Communist party, and in event of war with Russia they would probably act just as any other Communists would. So would members of other minority and majority groups... Most Negroes -- and Italians and Irish and Jews and Swedes and Slavs and other Americans -- would act just as all these groups did in the last war. They'd do their best to help their country stay out of war; if unsuccessful, they'd do their best to help their country win the war -- against Russia or any other enemy that threatened us... I can't speak for any fifteen million people any more than any other one person can, but I know that I've got too much invested for my wife and child and myself in the future of this country, and I and other Americans of many races and faiths have too much invested in our country's welfare, for any of us to throw it away. I am a religious man. Therefore, I cherish America where I am free to worship as I please, a privilege which some countries do not give. And I suspect that 999 out of almost any 1,000 colored Americans you meet will tell you the same thing. But that doesn't mean that we're going to stop fighting race discrimination in this country until we've got it licked. It means that we're going to fight it all the harder because our stake in the future is so big. We can win our fight without the Communists and we don't want their help...
