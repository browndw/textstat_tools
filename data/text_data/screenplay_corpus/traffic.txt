In chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio. Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_RODMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This informant, paid by the police, using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm. A working farm. A farm where honest Americans make their living.

</MR_RODMAN>
<DIRECTION>
One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the others, is clearly bemused by this performance.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_RODMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The government, in its haste, has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is, at best, questionable --

Judge Wakefield interrupts --

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client didn't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
A polite chuckle from the justices --
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lately the only variation I'm hearing in your argument is the name of the client. And you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in the United Sates. When you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm, whether it's one joint or an acre of plants, your property can be seized and your property can be sold.

</ROBERT>
<MR_RODMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry the court finds my argument repetitious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_RODMAN>
<ROBERT>

	Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of advice? The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my whereabouts, I recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm.

<DIRECTION>
Javi and Manolo watch the moving van approach. Javi reaches under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher. He rolls down the window and plants it on the roof. He flips the switch.

Nothing happens. He jiggles the wire and the siren BURPS and the light flashes. Manolo and Javi step from the car, smiling.

The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I see. How much do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The driver pulls a wad of bills. Javi shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want more than this?

Javi shakes his head. The driver exchanges a look with his partner.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Javi smiles. The driver gets out and walks to the back of the truck. He opens the rear door. There are neatly-stacked crates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911." He reaches into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also with the scorpion stamped on it. He turns to see Javi with his gun drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop the package. Put your hands behind your head. You're under arrest.

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows appear, closing fast.

<DIRECTION>
The SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull to a stop. A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus past the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS surround them like a SWAT team.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO SALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.

Ruiz FIRES the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in the chest, knocking him backwards.

From all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing their weapons. An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing in return. Nobody was aware of the other's presence.

It's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three competing sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS, GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

<CHIEF_OF_STAFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until you officially take over the office of National Drug Control Policy, under no circumstances should you speak to the press unprotected, without going through this office or having someone in the room. There are a lot of interests in this town and, right now, they're all scared of you. The reason they're scared of you...technically, you have veto power over their budgets. So think about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna want to speak to you. And that's the good news... You'll also be meeting Senators and Congressman, each with a specially prepared question. Their question is designed for one thing: to make them look smart. If you lecture them, they won't think you respect them. If you respond with utter humility, they will. Remember, this is about your respect for them, and the President's respect for them. Speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from Russia and China, we'll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up.

	I just want to be clear about one thing. I used to work for him, but now I work for you. I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues. The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico. I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me. That's why I can help protect you.

<SHERIDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating. Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.

Maybe ten TEENAGERS are partying hard in this kitchen. It's weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up.

There are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table. Caroline and Seth and two friends sit around this table. VANESSA, 16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the hit. FUCKED-UP BOWMAN, 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby Huey face, takes a slug of vodka.

They are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up --

<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I'm saying, what I'm saying, is it never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them, like we all look at each other and nod with responses we've been trained to make, not real responses, just social conventions, phony, fake smiles, surface bullshit... I mean, we're all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like, really like? Do I know what Seth's afraid of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman?

Everyone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw appreciatively --

	And that's not even fair. Because listen to me. I'm fucking lying right now. This is exactly what I'm talking about... I'm supposedly talking about you, making some big point about you, and it's really about me. So I should talk about me, not you, not even the universal "you..."

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay, I'm worried I'm not really smart or that I'm not nearly as smart as people think I am, or that my parents' expectations have been way too high since I was five, I mean who knows they're going to Harvard when they're five, not that I'm blaming them for anything because everything's great, and I may not even get in, but we all feel this shit and we never acknowledge it and if we can't acknowledge it to the people we care the most about then who will we ever say it too and what kind of life will that be?

Francisco starts to squirm and whimper. The torturer closes one of Francisco's nostrils and sprays the pepper-laced water into the other nostril.

Robert is in the hallway, at Caroline's door. He opens it and we get BLASTED WITH MUSIC.

Caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on. She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert calls her name, but the SOUNDTRACK is drowning him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to hear. She takes the headphones off - the MUSIC stops - and turns to look at him. Or rather, she looks right through him, as though he didn't exist. Robert is so taken aback by the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak.

She turns away from him and puts the headphones back on.

The PROSECUTOR is finishing his argument --
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a man who heads a large criminal organization with international contacts we can only begin to understand. Our case against him is very strong. He is not a flight risk. His flight is assured. The people ask that your honor denies bail.

<DIRECTION>
The prosecutor sits. Carl's defense lawyer, MICHAEL ADLER, from the Georgetown party, stands and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<ADLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client is no more a flight risk than your Honor or the able prosecutor. He is a pillar of his community, a family man with a wife and child in La Jolla, the community where he has made his home for over twenty years. As our defense will quickly show, my client is guilty of nothing more than being a handy target for an admitted criminal. Therefore we ask that you release Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom. She's not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her pajamas. She's reading a magazine. The exhaust fan is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with cutouts from magazine pictures and copy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred aluminum foil; she's done many hits. She leans over and picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in her soap dish. She drops it on a clean place on the foil. She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's turned into a straw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She heats the bottom of the foil. The crack "crackles."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She chases the smoke across the foil. A huge hit. She leans her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the exhaust fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline looks at her watch. It's 7:20. She stands suddenly, unsteadily. She looks at herself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's really high and indecisive. She looks around wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the shower. She turns it on. She drops her pajamas.
</DIRECTION>

She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, taking another really big hit. She crushes the foil and flushes it down the toilet. She hops in the shower.

The water streams over her face. After a long beat she finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and steam. She's in ecstacy.

<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drugs weren't even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem. Opiates. But, who was using 'em? Chinese immigrants. Slave labor. And the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music. People on the fringe. Artists. Decadent rich people. And who got scared? White men in power. Who's scared today? White men in power. If J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller ever admitted using, it'd be a whole different story.

They wait in a line in the narrow, poorly lit corridor. At the end of the hall a hatch in a door slides back and the drugstore is open. People buy and leave.

Seth and Caroline approach. In the hatch is a hardened dealer, 20's, named SKETCH, which is tattooed on his forearm. He checks out Caroline's body.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caroline, give me your money.
	</DIALOGUE>

She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs: gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911."

Caroline has been watching the transaction. Sketch makes slow eye contact with Caroline. After a beat --

They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the black and white television bolted to the bureau. The mini- fridge. Caroline bounces on the bed. They are teenagers.

EXT. VERDANT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Birds are chirping. Javi waits in the car as Manolo takes the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up the walkway to the arched doorway. He knocks on the heavy wooden door.

	You don't have the keys. Oh that's perfect. Are you an idiot?

Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing there. Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast space. The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags inside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a few feet away. The man wears sunglasses. His complexion is strange and his neck is bandaged.

The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears Rosario's happy LAUGHTER drifting down from an upstairs window.

	No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.

Robert Wakefield steps inside his home. It's very QUIET. He checks the mail on the hall table.

Robert walks down the hallway. He steps into Caroline's bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the faint sound of a lighter CLICKING. AGAIN and AGAIN, then a COUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline sits on the toilet. Glamour Magazine on her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's wild-eyed and paranoid. The exhaust fan is running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aluminum foil is on the sink. The last little bit of heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house. What she's wondering is if someone is outside the door listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it. She does the hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And seems to feel better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door. The VOICE of her father muffled through the solid wood.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (muffled by the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caroline. Open this door immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Caroline is up like a shot. She looks around. The POUNDING on the door gets stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
(faking the best she can)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it? I'm going to the bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air freshener which she sprays into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush by her father while avoiding his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
Robert grabs her by the arms. He pushes her against the wall and looks at her pupils. He looks at her fingernails. The blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going anywhere, young lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there; she's very high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert sniffs the air. He throws open cabinets, searching for drugs. He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by the charred aluminum foil.

<ROBERT>

	Where is it? Where are the drugs?

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me? Oh, okay. Fuck me. Fuck you.

</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Robert is losing it. He throws stuff around the bathroom and then, for the first time, looks up. He sees the long light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to ask you one time to tell me the truth so that I can help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, young lady, that's it.

</ROBERT>
<CAROLINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I give a fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLINE>
<DIRECTION>
Robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a charred spoon. It confuses him. He throws it into the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out another spoon. He pulls out crumpled bindles, rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up the sink. Robert stares at it, the amount and complexity has him momentarily baffled.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>

	What is wrong with you? What?

	Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year. But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.

Francisco steps from the car and mingles in with OTHER PEOPLE walking along the sidewalk. He follows them for few yards, picking his moment.

He closes the distance to Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, pulling a pistol from inside his jacket. He takes careful aim from twelve feet away and is about to shoot Ruiz when a bullet hole appears in his chest. He staggers, trying to squeeze the trigger, Francisco fires the gun once, wildly --

Robert is standing in the middle of her room. He's not sure what he's looking for. Everywhere he looks: her personal things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his daughter has escalated into a search for clues. He opens her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her room. He tosses a stack of magazines. A fashion magazine, airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert stares at the foil on the carpet. It's charred on the outside. He picks it up. And unfolds it. There's a dried milky white substance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them. Then, somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth. He holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud of smoke. Robert sucks all of it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits a long time then exhales. His eyes shut. The tube drops from his mouth. He staggers and, overwhelmed by the sensations, sits on the bed. The lighter and foil fall from his hands.
</DIRECTION>

A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know where he is. He looks at the room, confused. He stumbles to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.

	Hey man, back the fuck up. To this place. What's that shit? Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs? You know where I can get drugs? What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities? If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man. The product's marked up three hundred percent. You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?

</ROBERT>
<JAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could mean that, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVIER>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
