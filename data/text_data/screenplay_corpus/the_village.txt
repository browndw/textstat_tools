The opening credits roll over shots of the woods. At a cemetery, people are gathered for a funeral. A grave has been dug, and a small, plain coffin, rests near it. A man leans on the coffin, weeping a prayer.

A banquet has been laid on polished wooden tables, outdoors. The attendees are all dressed somberly. Many women wear bonnets or hats. Some of the men are bearded, and some are not. Some have long hair, others, short hair. All the women wear their hair tied back in some way. The dress confirms that it is the late 1800's. The surroundings reveal it to be a small village in a shallow valley, surrounded by forests. Many houses are made of stone, some of wood. The banquet includes bread, corn, greens, potatoes... a bounty from the recent harvest. Edward Walker, unofficial town leader, stands, making a speech before the feast. His hair is reddish, but going gray, and he wears a beard. August takes his hand.

He sits, and the villagers begin to eat. From the woods, a moaning sound, sorrowful. The villagers quiet, and are still. Noah Percy begins to laugh and clap and stands up. He is perhaps twenty-five, but has the mind of a small child. A young man seated next to him calms him down, and gets him to sit.

Men and women work side-by-side in a glass greenhouse, cultivating lettuce, rhubarb, and other foods for the winter. The ladies wear simple print dresses, with some petticoats underneath, and back-buttoned aprons over their dresses. The men wear pants, shirts, vests, and many wear hats. This is a simple village of working people. Fancy clothes are worn only at weddings and other celebrations.

Two sisters sweep the front porch of their simple home. They wear plain boots, not fancy shoes. They swirl their brooms around, light-hearted. The older sister spots something at the edge of the porch and puts her broom down. It is a red flower. Making haste, they pluck the flower, take it some yards from their home, and bury it. They return to their chores, but are subdued. The color of the flower, red, has spooked them, for it is the bad color.

At night, a bearded young man in a yellow cloak watches the woods from a watchtower, one of two, at the edge of the village. There is a bell in the tower, which can be rung as a warning. There are yellow penants and burning torches all around the edge of the forest. A low, moaning, rumbling sound comes from the trees.

It is morning. Edward Walker, the school-teacher, approaches a group of children outside the schoolhouse. They are gathered in a circle around something.

The flies buzz louder and louder. We see what they are looking at. It is a small animal, probably a fox. It has been killed and skinned, but the meat is still on its bones.

At a meeting of the Council of Elders, Vivian Percy is speaking. She is there, with her husband, Robert, August Nicholson, Victor, Edward and Tabitha Walker, Alice Hunt, Mrs. Clack, three other men, and one other woman. The women are knitting, since their hands are not needed for the meeting, and they smile and giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<Vivian>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we ought not to.... overlook The Flight of the Birds. We didn't have it last year, and I, for one, missed it desperately. And I know your wife missed the children, dressed in feathers and such.

A door opens at the end of the meeting hall, and all turn to see who has come in. It is a man with his hat in his hands, respectful.

The young man is Lucius Hunt, only son of the widow Alice Hunt. She jumps a bit when she sees him, but smiles. He wears denim work-pants, a gray shirt, and a brown jacket. His hair is a bit curly, but short, and there is a scar on his lip. He is clearly nervous and sways from one foot to the other. He holds a note, which he reads aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<August>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Lucius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</August>
<Lucius>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother is unaware of the reason for my visit today. She did not give her consent, or consult me in any form. The passing of little Daniel Nicholson, from illness, and other events, have weighed on my thoughts. I ask permission to cross into the forbidden woods and travel to the nearest town. I will gather medicines, and I will return. With regards to Those We Don't Speak Of, I am certain they will let me pass. Creatures can sense emotion and fear. They will see I am pure of intention, and not afraid. The end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucius>

His voice has been shaky throughout. It is clear that such a long speech from him is an unheard-of, thing, and that he is normally so quiet that people ask him to speak up. The elders stare at him. The wind moans past the watchtower.

Inside their house, all is simple. The beams of the loft are visible. The floor is plain wood. Alice stands in an ankle-length nightgown, in the doorway of her bedroom. An oil-lamp and some candles are lit. There is no electricity, running water, or flush toilets in this village, although such things are available in other parts of the world. Lucius sits on the stairs, tying his boot-laces.

There is a brief meeting in the meeting hall. Alice stands at the front, ahead of the elders, and speaks to the villagers' concerns.
</DIRECTION>
<Alice>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we SEEM to have amongst us, is a predator of some type, most likely a coyote, or a wolf. Its manner of... of killing and removing the fur, but leaving the flesh torn, may be a sign that this animal suffers from madness. And for the next fortnight we should be vigilant for sightings of this coyote. Keep careful watch over our little ones, as they play on the hills. As for the other notion... We do not believe our boundary has been breached. Those We Don't Speak Of are much... LARGER creatures than coyotes. And we would know, if they had been here.

Lucius is in the workshop, sharpening a tool. Kitty approaches him, wearing a pretty yellow dress. Her voice is slightly coy at the begining, but as she goes on, she becomes more wild. It is clear, however, that she has rehearsed her speech. She can't seem to help smiling and giggling, and she's probably very nervous.

	I wanted to, to... to tell you something. I love you, Lucius. I love you like the day is long! I love you more than the sun and the moon together! And if you feel the same way, then we should not hide it any longer. It's a gift, love is. We should be thankful! We should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs! Thank you! Thank you!

Kitty lays on her bed, sobbing and screaming. Her younger sister, Ivy, sits at her side, stroking her shoulder and singing a lullaby. She has reddish hair, too, but wears it comparatively short, about shoulder-length, barely any longer than some of the boys in the village. She wears a pretty blue denim dress.
</DIRECTION>
<Ivy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. Shhh. Baby, sleep, gently sleep, life is long is long and love is deep. Time will be sweet for thee. All the world to see. Time to look about and know, how the shadows come and go. How the breeze stirs the trees, how the blossoms grow.

We see their parents, and the four youngest of the six walker daughters, standing about at the entrance to the room. It is clear that that is Kitty and Ivy's space, that they are close together in age (perhaps twenty-one and nineteen respectively), while their younger sisters are all between about three and ten or so.

Some of the boys are at a place called "The Stump," where they are playing a game. Sort of like a test of manhood, they stand on the stump with their back to the woods at night, and see how long they can stay without getting scared. Tonight it it Jamison's turn.

Jamison breathes heavily, as the woods rustle. There is the sound of footsteps, and a strange growl that you or I might associate with a weed-whacker. Jamison hops off the stump and rushes toward the boys, and they run back to the village, panting and chuckling. They arrive in the safe area of the village and slow down.

	Some people - just a handful, mind you - give off the tiniest color. It's faint, like a haze. It's the only thing I ever see in the darkness. Papa has it, too. Do you wonder what your color is? Well, that I won't tell you. It's not ladylike to speak of such things. You shouldn't even have asked.

Lucius and some other boys walk around the perimeter of the village, painting yellow marks on tall poles. They wear cloaks of yellow wool, the safe color. Lucius sets down his paint bucket and pushes his hood back, then slowly, purposefully, he walks into the woods. He does not go far, just to a bush where there are red berries. He plucks a branch of them. He is very solemn. There is a creaking noise, a crack, and a growl, then some rustling. Lucius sees movement out of the corner of his eyes.

Noah continues to invite the creatures in. This is a game to him. The girls are all in various states of crying and silent prayer. There is a thumping, and the creatures enter the house, growling.

In the middle of the night, Ivy lays in bed with her eyes open. She is unused to sleeping in Kitty's bed. Suddenly she sits up in bed, gasping. She walks out on the porch, using memory and touch to guide her to where Lucius is sitting. She sits down next to him. They are perhaps four inches apart. They speak in low voices, so as not to wake Ivy's family.

	There are other porches. Do you find me too much of a tomboy? I do long to do boy things. Like that game the boys play at the stump. They put their backs to the woods, and see how long they can wait before getting scared. That's so exciting. I understand you hold the record. It will never be broken, they say.

	Why can you not stop saying what is in yours? Why must you lead, when I want to lead? If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance. If I want to speak, I will open my mouth and speak. Everyone is forever plaguing me to speak further. Why? What... good is it to tell you you are in my every thought from the time I wake? What good can come from my saying I-- I sometimes cannot think clearly, or- or do my work properly? What gain can rise from my telling you... the only time I feel fear as others do, is when I think of you in harm? That is why I am on this porch, Ivy Walker. I fear for your safety above all others. And yes... I will dance with you on our wedding night.

	That he was, he had a gift for that. If he was given one dollar, in less than a fortnight, he would have turned it into five. You do not know of money. It is not part of our life here. Money can be a wicked thing. It can turn men's hearts black. Good men's hearts. My father could not see this, for all his gifts. He was a poor judge of a man's character. Your grandfather WAS a good man, Ivy. He had a laugh that could be heard three houses away. He used to hold my hand as I hold yours. He taught me strength, and showed me love, and told me to lead when others would only follow. Your grandfather, James Walker, died in his sleep. A man put a gun to his head and shot him while he dreamed. I tell you this so you will understand some of the reasons for my actions, and the actions of others. You are a strong one, Ivy. You lead when others would only follow. You see light, when there is only darkness. I trust you. I trust you among all others.

	On this paper has been written a tool of medicine. It is common in the towns. You will go... with two escorts. Follow the sounds of a stream. A half-day's journey will bring you to a hidden road. At this hidden road, the two escorts will wait as you continue. You alone will follow the road... and leave Covington Woods. You are to tell no one in the towns where we are... and return with haste. I cannot come with you. You gave your heart to this boy. He is in need. Are you ready to take this burden, which by right, is yours and yours alone?

Daylight. Ivy walks through the now-muddy forest, swinging her cane back and forth, her cloak smeared brown at the bottom, and smudges all over. She walks forward to a ledge, and feeling no way beyond it, she turns to go back. The ground gives way. She shrieks, but manages to hold the edge. The mud is too slippery to hold it for long. She slips further into the hole, but she has caught her hands in some roots. She whimpers, but manages to swing her bundle and cane up onto solid ground, and then she hauls herself, grunting, out of the hole. It is very deep. She is covered in mud. Gasping, she makes her way around the hole, to a strange stumps sticking out of the ground. The mud is all over her cloak.

Later in the day, she has let her cloak dry, and much of the mud has caked and fallen off, though there is still some. She swings her cane back and forth, checking for obstacles. There is a crack. She taps her cane again. It is broken. She pulls it apart and drops it. There is a rustling from the woods around her. She searches with her hands for a rock, and tosses it in the direction of the sound. The rustling comes from another direction now, louder and louder. She stumbles off in a random direction, panting and whimpering, whacking branches away from her face, but the sound is getting closer. She s crying now. She stops in a small clearing. There are red berries all around her, and bits of snow on the ground. She cannot see them. There is a growl. She turns slowly around. One of the creatures stands just at the edge of the clearing.

She backs up and reaches a tree, and edges her way around it, facing away from the creature. She listens around the edge she came from. The creature is close, only three or four feet away. She starts walking away, as quietly as she can, hoping the creature hasn't spotted her. She gets some distance away, and then there's a crack and a roar. It HAS spotted her. She stares for some moments in the direction of the creature. Neither move. Then it lunges for her, charging. She screams. It slashes at her, knocking her down, but not doing any damage. It pauses, then turns. She has stood up. It roars again, and chases her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps running, but she is losing strength. She slows to a fast walk, not hearing the creature around her. Suddenly she bumps into something. It is the stump she felt before, when she crawled out of the hole. She feels it to be sure, then gets an idea. She drops her pack, puts her hood up, and stands just by the edge of the hole with her arms up. The creature comes charging at her, roaring. She jumps out of the way just in time. It falls into the hole without a sound.
