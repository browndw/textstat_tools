	Very well, where should I begin? My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical.

MUSIC: Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive dance. He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.

He throws seven cigarettes one by one. Each cigarette lands perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth. Austin smokes the remaining cigarette.

Austin begins to do a seductive striptease. The Fembots are aroused. He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and forth like in Jacob's Ladder.

Eventually her head explodes. Austin is now stripped down to his Union Jack bikini briefs and

turns to another Fembot. Her head explodes.

He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly. Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his bare foot. He gives a look of disguised pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot. Her head explodes. He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, whose head explodes.

Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes. Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining Fembots.
