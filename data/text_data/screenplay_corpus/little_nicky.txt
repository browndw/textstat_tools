EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful late summer night. Crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb. He has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman. Suddenly the lights turn on.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Showtime!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my G-D, yes! I wish you would let me rub those feet. Of course I wouldn't use my hands. Heh heh heh heh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
He sips some wine.
</DIRECTION>

The mother starts to unbutton her blouse. She takes it off, revealing a nice bra.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like Victoria just told me her secret.

<PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what. This simply won't do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials. The son answers.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<PEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Scottie. Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<PEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little birdie. A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my G-D Scottie. Is there a man up our tree?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper gets nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her no. Tell her it's just a big bird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises. We SEE Scottie with his sling shot. The mother nods yes. He shoots it. It hits the peeper square in the head. He falls to the ground with a thud.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me. And wear your bikini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper looks up. He sees Scottie pushing a television out the window. It lands on top of the peeper. He's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on all sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper is falling down, down, down. The whole way screaming like a five-year old girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEEPER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire. He SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES. We hear screaming. Wham! We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a heap in a shallow pit of coals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the fire wall at different levels. (NOTE: All the arrivals clothes are now burned & shredded).
</DIRECTION>
<GATEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<PEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I in hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEEPER>
<GATEKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area. We leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATTE PAINTING HELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell. A road leads toward it like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals. We see the black castle in the distance. The camera zooms into the castle, to one particular window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser, heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no bed - Devils don't sleep). Nicky is air guitaring to the song. Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled "NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>

<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Dad says it's the breaks that make the torture. You have to let people feel a sense of relief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>

Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HUMAN_DARTBOARD>

Cassius pulls out the dart. The eye comes with it.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it. THWACK! It splatters like a grape.
</DIRECTION>
<HUMAN_DARTBOARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

Nicky enters sheepishly.

Cassius' eyes start glowing red.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I'll take a rain check on0
	</DIALOGUE>

Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible force.

<CASSIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got ya! Now here's the big finish...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. Please Cassius...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky's hand is being possessed. It gets closer and closer until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaaah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own hand. Nicky screams even louder. Adrian smiles. They don't notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you boys doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Cassius releases Nicky's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?

</CASSIUS>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad gives Nicky a wink. Nicky smiles. Dad has an air of confidence and power.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the boys to the throne area. We see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily. Dad looks, shakes his head. Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him. Dad closes the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne. Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>

Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out. Dad turns his attention back to his sons.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so...so...

<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.

</NICKY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.

</DAD>
<CASSIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad! This is Hoyashit.
	</DIALOGUE>

HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by Jimmy. They head towards the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples. Hitler picks out a relatively small one. Dad shakes his head "no." Dad walks over to the closet. Hitler picks out a really big pineapple. Dad nods "yes." Hitler sadly hands it to Dad. Jimmy bends Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls. Both are pissed. There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

	You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.

Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face. The Monster shrugs and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven." Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell. We need a place where we can rule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cassius throws a rock at the Monster. He yelps, then turns around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back. Cassius sees this and gets enraged.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you wanna be a big man? Bring it on!! Let's see what you got!

Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up. Two huge boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head. We only see them from the front for a second. From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to Nicky.

Nicky makes it back through the hole. Looks both ways and hops out of the hole. He carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side. In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport. On the sign is scrawled "NICKY."

<NICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off limits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.

Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully clothed. When he inhales through his nose, we hear that familiar snoring/snorting sound. But when he exhales, we hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

</DIRECTION>
<CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that. Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible. Moses this. Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity. But has he ever really done anything for us? Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway? Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes? No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us.

Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts to "raise the roof." Then thinks better of it. The Cardinal points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
(standing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't. Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord. If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins." Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
A hubbub is raised by the crowd. Fitzie raises the roof again, this time energetically.
</DIRECTION>
<CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen to that. Let the sin begin!

</CARDINAL>

The hubbub grows to a roar. Several PEOPLE start fighting over the money in the collection plate.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky is an expert pillow fighter. He lands a series of awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves. Adrian is dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him. Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face. Adrian goes down hard. Nicky towers over him.

<DIRECTION>
BACK ON ADRIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by demons. Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't open his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in, bro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth. Adrian jams the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in. Adrian smiles. But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIUS>

We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large circle around the flask. Valerie and the gang make it down off the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump. The crowd REACTS. A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a horrible thud.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOORAY. Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living people CHEER. The student, very happy, opens his kimono. The people and demons near him are grossed out.

Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs and kisses him on the mouth. The crowd CHEERS. But Nicky won't stop kissing her. She starts to struggle for air. Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd stops CHEERING. Valerie is waving her arms for help. Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss. Adrian lets her go. And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? No tongue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns into a GIANT BAT. He lets out a huge roar, then flies around, laughing, scaring people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valerie runs over and picks up the flask. She looks inside.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Butterflies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICKY>
<DIRECTION>
And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands on his feet. Adrian lands and stares down Nicky. The clock is one minute from midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adrian swoops down. Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground. Out of it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.
</DIRECTION>
