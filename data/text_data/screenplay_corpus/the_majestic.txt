"GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"

<DIRECTION>
Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame, a gentle rain.

<DIRECTION>
In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and- footprints in the wet cement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another postcard:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!"

In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at the Brown Derby. Or Ciro's. Or the Coconut Grove...

More postcards. Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones that you and I know today. These are palaces. Temples. Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian. The Carthay Circle. The Paramount, the Million Dollar. From a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall. The ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat. The popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil.

A gigantic aerial shot. Postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.

Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the street to

	Born and raised here, thank you very much. Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else. But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload. To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. To me, it's the theater that's playing "The African Queen."

And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE AFRICAN QUEEN." Still the same shot, buses disgorge TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater. The MEN doff their hats and mop their brows. The WOMEN pull their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on their way to

Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably be a good idea.

He turns the key and hits the starter. The engine hums to life. Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze and puts the car in gear.

The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt and stalls.
</DIRECTION>

The full moon is low over the ocean. Pete's car is parked at the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away. The ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight. Pete is asleep in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his face, snoring.

The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.

Pete is finally relaxed. He takes off his hat and jams it down in the back seat. He takes a deep breath -- with the wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at peace. He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the fuel gauge.

The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.

Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that will take him toward the lights. He passes a hand-painted sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI."

Pete pulls out onto the road.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted roadside sign which reads:

<DIRECTION>
INT./ EXT. PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading "LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>

Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the edge...

<DIRECTION>
... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and into the rapidly-moving water below!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is intense. Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat (thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle. Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WASH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air. His fight isn't over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. He swims with all his might toward the far bank.
</DIRECTION>

Drained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to his feet.

He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps... and his heel hits a rock...

Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow on another rock. He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and lands face down in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.

IN BLACK, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing sound -- the sound of a dog...
</DIRECTION>

Pete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently licked in the face by the dog.

A no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an old railroad cap. He comes down to Pete, and using his walking stick, pokes him in the side.

A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner. There's a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man who has little to smile about because he has little to care about.

Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow-white hair. He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and slowly turns to face Pete. He looks closer... and closer. Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe.

<DIRECTION>
PETE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY

<DIRECTION>
Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - THE BIJOU.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building styles. It's as though the architect took random parts of a Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was "The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
" HE B J U"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE B J U" sign becomes apparent. Train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle. As we watch, a TRAIN ROARS BY. Everything shakes. It's not an earthquake, it's a trainquake. The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares at the monstrosity. His face is ashen. His heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees.

INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by the exterior. Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls. It's sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is -- probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions.

Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one open.

<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin, framed by ragged red velveteen drapery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old upright piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke walks a few steps down the aisle. He picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits. As he does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage. Harry comes over and sits behind him.

<DIRECTION>
(deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.

INT. BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater. It's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke. It's a Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder. He has one arm around Harry and the other around his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The day you shipped out. That was a proud day for your mother and me. Last time you saw her. Last time I saw you.

He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine looking woman. It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from the 30's.

There's a small picture frame in the window. Harry reaches down, gingerly picks it up and turns it around.

It's early morning. Luke is sound asleep, still in his clothes. In the distance, a train sounds its HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something's strange, though. He frowns. The train is GETTING CLOSER. Luke's eyes POP OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him. Harry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN.

<HARRY>

<LUKE>

</LUKE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more awake. He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. The elderly woman nudges Harry gently.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but you don't... you need to be re- introduced. Luke, this is Mrs. Irene Terwilliger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Luke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand. She's tiny, seventy if she's a day. She smiles and curtsies slightly. Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_TERWILLIGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Head cashier and refreshments clerk. So glad to have you back, my boy!

	You remember Luke, don't you?

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
OLT TIM is -- well, old. His clothes are a tad shabby, but well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly frame. He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly removes as he shakes Luke's hand. He's a man of few words, his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles.

Luke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward the screen. Old Time lags a few steps behind. At the orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit. The screen is a sea of repair patches. Harry pats it. Dust flies.

	Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.

Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs.

Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOB LEFFERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl. His face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on his forehead. He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes. Brings his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up. Except there's no hand there -- it's a hook.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Bob. Good to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob doesn't react. He glances away, and for a moment, his eyes meet Mabel's. She smiles warmly. He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ernie Cole pipes up.

<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke, I know there's a question that's on everybody's mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now that you're back, what're your plans?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes on Luke. He freezes, having just taken a forkful of food in his mouth. Harry jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
A MURMUR goes through the crowd. Stanton Lawson, standing behind Luke, taps him on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<STANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANTON>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(on the spot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... we're gonna try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lot of work, son. Place's been closed, what, three, four years now. Gonna be tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's tough, that means it's worth doing.

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Someone shouts "That's the spirit!," another shouts "Hear, hear!," and a chorus of VOICES join in agreement.

	Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?

<SPENCER_S_VOICE>

	Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.

</SPENCER_S_VOICE>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, come on out here so's we can see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCER WYATT steps around from the back of the crowd near the door. He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled kid, no more than 19 or 20. Painfully shy, he clutches a clarinet case to his chest. He timidly smiles and waves at Luke, who smiles and nods back.
</DIRECTION>
<SPENCER>

	Hey, Luke.

	Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol' big band.

	We've been practicing... uh, sure, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPENCER>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how about tomorrow night, eight p.m., in city hall square? What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome Home Luke" celebration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Vociferous general AGREEMENT from the crowd -- which is quickly quieted by a MURMUR, which starts at the front door. The crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADELE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She locks eyes with Luke. Her hand goes to her mouth and her eyes well up. Slowly, she moves around the counter, the crowd moving aside for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her. Her eyes moist, she looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you... remember me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen you before. Your picture...

Mabel, clutching a napkin, leans over to Katie.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MABEL>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but I don't think I remember you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Adele leans up and kisses him softly. He looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll sure try.

As Mabel and Katie dab at their eyes, we

EXT. COMMERCE STREET - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side. She looks at him for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look... different.

</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did? Huh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it. From behind them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND. Adele turns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADELE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is following them. Adele turns and addresses the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>

(to the group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>

Harry comes over.

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.

And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the pair goodnight. Luke and Adele watch them disperse.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. We're alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn and start walking.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... where can we go?

Adele brightens.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a place. Come on!

She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square.

Adele and Luke stand by the front steps.

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	City hall?

</LUKE>
<ADELE>

	You must not remember anything. Come on.

She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the ground. She looks around. Certain the coast is clear, she pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops up and open. She looks at Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me?

AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT.

<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave. We slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue...

ON ADELE AND LUKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window. The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd they get it inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Through the door. It comes apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to the memorial. Squinting, she examines its base.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name's on here. See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Luke comes over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKE'S NAME
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her for a long moment. There's an electricity between them, and they both feel it.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why not?

</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.

	What did... what did I want to be?

</LUKE>
<ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away, rubs his head.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wish I could remember some of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving toward her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>

Pause.

	We were in love... weren't we?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<DIRECTION>
(then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good. She has the hiccups again.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

(hic!)

(hic!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	fine. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hic!)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to not struggle against the hiccups. She has them, and that's just the way it is.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were we going to get married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eventually. We were going to be

	<DIALOGUE>
	engaged... when you came back from

<DIRECTION>
(hic!)

	<DIALOGUE>
	overseas...

</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. She's strikingly beautiful at this particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and all. He moves closer to her. She moves closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but you had to go... serve
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hic!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	your country...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss passionately. She reaches up and puts her arms around him. He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... it worked.

And as she smiles and kisses him again we

EXT. THE BIJOU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door. He has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's very dark. Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door, when he looks down and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ORANGE TABBY CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor. It looks at Luke, and PURRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke closes the door and moves to the cat. He crouches down and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, fella. So you live here, too, huh? How come Harry didn't mention that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at Luke. Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty film cans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp" with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door at the end of a hallway. Luke, following the cat, comes around the same corner and looks at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to Tipperary."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke moves to the door and knocks.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, Old Tim? Sorry, it's late. It's Luke. Can I come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open, revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat, stroking its fur.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_TIM>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.

</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot, which is perfectly made, military-style.

<OLD_TIM>

	Not used to visitors.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny icebox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing him. Silence. Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PHOTO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke. He rubs against his legs, purring. Luke leans down to pet him.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<OLD_TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cat.

</OLD_TIM>
<LUKE>

Pause, then suddenly.

<OLD_TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform?

</OLD_TIM>

Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks more than a couple of words.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do everything I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war.

It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment. The "SAND PIRATES" poster leans up against a chair. Pete's two boxes of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top.

There's an insistent KNOCK at the door.

We HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open, revealing the building SUPER, 50s. Behind him is Leo Kubelsky. They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air.

<LEO>

	You smell gas?

Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill.

INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show of Shows." He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit ears, steps back -- and is successful. SID CAESAR And IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch, and Lardner fairly roars with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire. He returns to the spot in front of the TV, and the picture is perfect again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORBELL RINGS. He's torn -- if he moves, the picture will break up. The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's voice from upstairs:

<ADELE>

	Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.

	Oh, hell...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARDNER>
<DIRECTION>
He moves from his spot. The reception goes bad, and he marches to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly out-of-date coat and tie.
</DIRECTION>
<LARDNER>

	Evening, Luke.

	Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...

Adele comes down the stairs. Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...

</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward pause. Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't have worn the suit.

Adele comes down the stairs.

Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other. Lardner breaks it.

(encouraging them toward the door)

<DIRECTION>
Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV carefully all the while. The reception is staying perfect. Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to. He stifles his urge, and heads for his chair. Gingerly, he sits. Still perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. The picture goes completely haywire again.

	What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?

	<DIALOGUE>
	My what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.

</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh. That was nice of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle. As soon as he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.

Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion. He clears his throat and continues.

<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We never forgot. And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle. Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again. I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive. But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too. God bless you, son.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to meet you. Again.

	Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

</LUKE>
<FITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FITTS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<FITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FITTS>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<FITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. I just want the land.

</FITTS>
<LUKE>

(taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<FITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.

(it's an alien word)

	<DIALOGUE>
	A super market. Huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<FITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.

Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.

The crowd MOANS slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into "Moonlight Serenade," slow and easy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ADELE AND LUKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they hold each other close and dance. Adele rests her head on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed. Luke strokes her hair and sways her gently to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band. Mabel comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. She's asking him if he would like to dance. Bob looks down at the ground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket and moves away, leaving Mabel standing there.

EXT. THE BIJOU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door. He pulls out his keys and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEOWING at him from the sidewalk. He holds the door open, and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the auditorium. Luke closes the door... and stops. He HEARS something, and so do we. Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the auditorium. The piano continues, building slightly in volume. He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively pushes one open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering, reflected light of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie is "The Big Parade." The old, decomposing nitrate print is badly scratched and stained. A young, beautiful Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke stares at the screen. The look on his face is one of bewilderment -- and awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE PIANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune. But it really doesn't matter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately. She never takes her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered screen, except to close them when she is overcome with emotion. Even so, she never misses a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fairly dance upon the keys. Stiff and wrinkled as they are, they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity that the old piano can muster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke is moved by what he's witnessing. This is the magic...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old Tim. Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief. He doesn't notice
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who looks up towards the projection booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
filling the frame. We're looking directly into the beam of light radiating from the projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the booth. We come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's face fills the screen. He is watching the film; his eyes are wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's unfolding on the screen for the very first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES, signaling the end of the reel. Harry moves away from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap! falp! falps! out of the projector. He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies. It's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up. This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up reel and takes it down. He's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone. He looks over the projector to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing there. Their eyes meet. Someone should say something -- both men search for words. Suddenly, Luke feels very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's interrupted a very private ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry senses this. Clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

</LUKE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Father and son look at each other for a long moment -- searching each other's eyes. Harry smiles a sort-of half- smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the rewind bench. Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel. Slowly, he begins to turn the crank, rewinding the film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not there.

Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth.

FADE TO BLACK.

In bed, sound asleep, snoring. A HAND reaches into frame and shakes him awake.

INT. CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor Cole presiding. Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts. VERA DWIGHT, the council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading the minutes of the last meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>

	Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention.

As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry, Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches.

	Thanks. Well, I'll make this short and sweet. The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all. So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out.

	Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...

Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS, watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen drops down on Luke's head. Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!! He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to Harry and grabs his end. It's Carl Leffert. A second later, someone else grabs Old Tim's end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOB LEFFERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook. He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow.

INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Harry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls. Then, as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall paint and brushes. Immediately, they all set to work painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby. He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps back... carefully... to admire his handiwork. For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not for long. Luke tenses... the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater. Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U." Luke winces.

INT. ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano. She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys. She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music. Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt. Before long, all eyes are on her. Everyone's listening. Transported.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, she stops. Overcome. Everyone applauds. Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.
</DIRECTION>

	That was beautiful.

Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left. As she begins to play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_TERWILLIGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good... that's good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TERWILLIGER>
<DIRECTION>
But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing. He's just plunking bass notes. But after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie woogie beat. Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_TERWILLIGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, Luke! That's no way to treat Mr. Chopin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_TERWILLIGER>

She stands and moves away. Luke keeps playing, grinning madly -- he's loving it! After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to Luke's bass line.

Luke and all the letters up again. He steps back, checks his watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train goes by. This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a jaunty angle. Luke smiles.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MABEL'S DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter, devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy. Luke's and Adele's hair is practically white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are stained with paint specks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably with Bob Leffert. She smiles at him warmly, then turns to refill Harry's coffee cup. Harry thanks her, then turns back to the newspaper he's reading.

It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in his dress greens. He brings his hook-hand up and salutes smartly. Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she blinks back tears.

Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses him on the forehead.

The Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps of City Hall, playing the "Star Spangled Banner." They are being conducted by their director, MR. PHILLIPS. Luke and Harry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along. Then, Luke takes a closer look at the DRUM MAJOR...

Luke and Adele applaud. Old Time looks up at them -- AND SMILES!

Old Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle. Mrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter, ready to sell tickets and refreshments.

Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby. Luke checks his watch. It's time. He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old Tim, who swings the door open...

Immediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater. Luke exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside.

Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring how handsome the old place looks. Old Tim, snappily attired in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan. Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter. All is well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke goes to the lobby's poster case. He opens it, and unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for "SAND PIRATES" -- the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case.

Pete comes out into the bright midday sun. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust, and when they do, he becomes aware of perhaps TWENTY PEOPLE lining the sidewalk in front of the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize several of the people. Carl Leffert. Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. Daley Thornhill. Katie Rutherford. Stanton Lawson. Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it. They're not an angry mob, they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions. Shock. Disillusionment. Betrayal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an awkward moment. Pete doesn't quite know how to react. He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't know what to say. He wishes one of them would talk to him, just say something, anything. But no one does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete. He shoves his hook hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by Mabel, then his brother, then the others...

... leaving Pete alone.

Mrs. Terwilliger, behind the candy counter, wipes up an imaginary spill, a full wheel of unsold tickets by her elbow.

Pete anxiously paces the lobby. He looks into

THE AUDITORIUM.

Every seat is empty.

There's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road, obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away. It's deadly quiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parks his Model A truck. He gets out, and an big old German Shepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed.

Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank and sniffing the air expectantly.

He stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE. Lottie starts BARKING. The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER. Rory's getting worried. He looks at

THE FOG BANK.

<DIRECTION>
It's starting to GLOW from within. Lottie's barking gets LOUDER and angrier. Suddenly, a large black car punches out of the fog bank and tears down the road. It's followed by another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town.

Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly past the station.

	What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story.

<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The agenda for this morning's special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities shows a number of witnesses, and I'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times, or this chamber will be closed. I'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press. I hope that's clear.

As he enters the chamber, dozens of FLASHBULBS fire as every eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat. As he sits, he glances behind him.

Leo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators. He smiles and nods at Pete.

Pete does as instructed.

	Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?

	Mr. Appleton, you mention that your home is Hollywood, California. But isn't it true that for the last several months, you've made your home in a town called Lawson, California?

<PETE>

	Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"

</CLYDE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.

</PETE>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to notes)

<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(ON RADIO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.

	Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?

	Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?

<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start with what you knew then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?

<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(slyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The audience LAUGHS. Doyle BANGS his gavel.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asked for the truth. That's the truth. I had no idea what the meeting was about. I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The audience LAUGHS. Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS his gavel.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chamber will come to order.

</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...

A few members of the audience APPLAUD. As Pete speaks, their numbers grow.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(passionately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am! I know that I...

Doyle BANGS his gavel several times. Pete stops and the room falls quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress. You will not be warned again, is that clear?

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not refuting anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.

	That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman. It's the backbone of this nation. It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential. It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear. It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country.

Leo takes one for himself and lights up. Pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head.

	When'd you quit smoking?

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke didn't smoke.

</LEO>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.

<DIRECTION>
But before Pete can answer...
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<LEO>

	What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?

Pete freezes. He slowly turns to Leo.

<PETE>

	Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.

<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's not what they think.

	So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.

	She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?

Pete is dumbstruck. He slumps in his seat, ashen.

<LEO>

	All of which means... "Ashes To Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back.

Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or screaming -- or both.

EXT. PETE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door. Pete vacantly grabs his suitcase and gets out. Leo shuts the door and calls after him, waving Pete's hat.
</DIRECTION>
<LEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter! Your hat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEO>
<DIRECTION>
Pete comes back and takes his hat. Leo grabs his hand.

INT. PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat. He sets them down and goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from the studio have been gathering dust these last three months.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPER>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him a key)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a new key for ya. That Mr. Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month. You got one swell friend there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPER>
<DIRECTION>
The Super moves to the door and turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to have you back, Pete.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPER>
<DIRECTION>
He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out the tin-toy fire truck. Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back in the box and replies too late:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat. As he does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO DELLY, THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS. LOVE, LUKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete closes the book. He thinks for a moment, then glances over at the phone. He picks it up and dials "0."

EXT. TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

Our view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara. Looking into one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring out at the passing scenery.

EXT. LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train is just pulling in to Lawson. As it SHUDDERS to a halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENTIRE TOWN has turned out. They're all there, smiling broadly. A large, hand-lettered banner reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELCOME HOME PETE! LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence. Pete descends from the train and moves into the throng. The first two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling as they shake hands vigorously.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me.
	</DIALOGUE>

Mabel's mouth drops open.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>

As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADELE

is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss. Another CHEER goes up.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you got the telegram.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...

	Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Happily ever after" is a relative term, folks. My world is much smaller now, and my dreams are very different than they were. But I have something now that I never had before: I have the magic. And it's for sale at the Bijou, every day of the year. All you need is the price of a ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE_S_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being enveloped by the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot office, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the town, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's marquee. The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating the sign, which reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING. We BOOM UP TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
