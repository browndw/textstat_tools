HITCHCOCK soaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor.

PUDGY FINGERS part the slats of the blind. Hitch stares out hoping for some human moment to spy on. He's restless...

<DIRECTION>
Peggy ushers JOSEPH STEFANO, 30s, into Hitch's office.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH_STEFANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.

	I thought only director's assistants needed psychiatrists, not writers.

The two men stare at each other but Stefano's not remotely intimidated.

	Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT who's consulting a ledger. She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<ACCOUNTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's still the federal income tax payments... the property taxes... Not to mention the absence of any salary while he's actually making the film...

</ACCOUNTANT>
<ALMA>

	Stop waffling, Donald. Give it to me straight.

The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage to look his favorite client in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ACCOUNTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hitch wasn't exaggerating. If the film's a flop, you're going to have to sell the house.

<DIRECTION>
Alma's moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the accounts herself, the dogs at her feet. Her face is now properly filled with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch enters, holding out some typed pages. Alma covers her worry. He puts the pages on the table next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>

	I got Joe Stefano to write out the first few scenes. Why don't you take a look?

INT. PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The intimidating plaque for the MPAA's "PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE" on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stefano's TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK, 70s, the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture Production Code. He sits at the head of a big table with TWO ASSISTANTS. Sitting opposite are Hitchcock, Peggy and several silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES.
</DIRECTION>
<GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>

	I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion.

	Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower?

<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap.

</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Shurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of humor.
</DIRECTION>
<GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders -- provided the glass is frosted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt. Shurlock turns the page.
</DIRECTION>
<GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then -- this scene with the toilet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No American movie has ever found it "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
No response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares down at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country. Will you be making jokes then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEOFFREY_SHURLOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug.
</DIRECTION>

Sunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing Hitchcock trying his best to recline on an ANALYST'S COUCH.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, "You're good."

He looks around the luxurious office.

	It's just that, more and more lately, I've been having these... impulses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
The analyst's MONTBLANC pen makes a note on a pad. We notice that his hands are surprisingly coarse.
</DIRECTION>
<ANALYST_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of impulses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANALYST_S_VOICE>

Finally Hitchcock is still. He stares up at the ceiling.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FRIDGE DOOR SNAPS OPEN to reveal Hitchcock's FACE in the darkness. He's in his pajamas. His hand trembles next to a stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned GRAPEFRUIT HALF at the back of the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls it out it to reveal a hidden stash of foie gras under the hollowed out grapefruit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to devour it when he catches sight of his DISTORTED REFLECTION in the chrome shelving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He backs away, disgusted at this monster before him, the light of the fridge illuminating his expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door is quietly shut and locked. The bottom drawer of a filing cabinet is inched open. A hand rummages deep inside and teases out a bulging MANILA FOLDER. A hidden stash of some kind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DESK LIGHT is switched on revealing HITCH. He carefully extracts the contents of the folder and lays them onto the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MASS OF PHOTOS OF ALL HIS BLONDE LEADING LADIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A personal collection lovingly kept. He settles in to study it, picking out his favorites, arranging them in order. They're all in the same pose, all with hair pinned up into a perfect bun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at each image with intensifying desire. He's created all of them. Every detail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's no longer enough...

THE ROW OF GLOSSY PERFECT BLONDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVES TO : INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of HANDSOME ACTOR HEADSHOTS on a table. HITCH glares at the waiting ACTORS in the hallway through the blinds. He turns back to Peggy and Alma and pulls a face.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send them all back to Glendale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>

Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots. Peggy shares a glance with Alma, then slides over RODDY MCDOWELL'S HEADSHOT.

</DIRECTION>
<ALMA>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of the duality he could bring to Norman. The rage lurking behind that little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out.

	I can't count how many times I've seen Strangers On a Train and Rope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY_PERKINS>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies. Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY_PERKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My only worry is that playing Norman might cut too close to home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY_PERKINS>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How so?

</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>

Hitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young actor...
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY_PERKINS>

	I was incredibly close to my mother. So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead. And then when I was five, he did just that...He keeled over from a heart attack.

(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see I've been guilty my whole life, Mr. Hitchcock.

Hitch is enthralled.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to remember this is all just make believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Perkins wishes he could be more reassured...
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY_PERKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to be prudish, but how far do you plan to push Norman's relationship with his mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY_PERKINS>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Further than you can possibly imagine.

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shovels the manure around the rosebushes.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting blisters just looking at you.

He holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red Sydonie rose.

Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect pink rose.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Janet Leigh? She's always the 'good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?

<JANET_LEIGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've written a complete history for her...It seems silly, but it helps me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET_LEIGH>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to pull a LEATHER NOTEBOOK from her handbag,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch's gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair, tied immaculately into the classic 'Hitchcock bun'.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't sound silly at all. Tell me one of her deepest secrets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
A quick look to Alma, as if to ask for permission before :
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_LEIGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She leads a double life. For instance, when she works at the Lowery office, she wears Tweed perfume. But, when she and Sam are together, she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin" by Lanvin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET_LEIGH>
<DIRECTION>
She notices Alma's expression.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_LEIGH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

<ALMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and the Shurlock Office.

</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I plan to shoot quick bits of film from various angles. Cut together, this montage will suggest nudity and violence but nothing will actually be shown.

<DIRECTION>
Janet studies them, deeply impressed. And relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>

	If you'll excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMA>

Alma's had enough. Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma get up and head to the restroom. She's unsure of what just happened but Hitch carries on regardless, either entirely oblivious or not caring at all...

INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT, LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alma enters and looks in the mirror, quietly devastated. She looks up to find another reflection in a mirror behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL LENGTH MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alma is SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED into a Technicolor Hitchcock blonde. In a beautiful Edith Head gown, her skin is velvet perfection, her hair blonde and impeccable.

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PERFECT PINK ROSEBUSHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like in a Douglas Sirk movie. The same roses that are the 'color' of Janet Leigh. Alma hovers with her secateurs for a moment and then starts SNIPPING off their heads with a Caligula-like lack of mercy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vase of flowers, none of them pink, in the center of the table. Hitch STARES into a refrigerator filled with boring tasteless health-conscious food.

Suddenly we're moving through an empty living room, prowling, just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear CLUNKING, then move over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags A WOMAN'S BODY, feet-first up the stairs. The clunking is from her head on the steps, which is wrapped in her dress.

Hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma finishes getting ready.

THE REAR-PROJECTION SET

<DIRECTION>
Janet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while "driving" a PARTIAL CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS.

</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>

SUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns.

It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy --

Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright. The credits come up: "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook, Adaptation by Alma Reville."

<DIRECTION>
Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's together.

The words "DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK" overwhelm the small screen. Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HITCHCOCK BLONDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch's personal collection. Alma enters and starts to go through them. Each photo is turned over a little more roughly than the last. It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left for her to find...

Alma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to dial...

CROSSING THE STAGE
</DIRECTION>

Hitch lurches towards the production office, starting to sweat, but his path is blocked by GRIPS laying cables. The set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos.

Alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around. It is old and falling apart with only a few functional furnishings.

Hitch enters the empty house at dusk. The dogs greet him. He listens a moment... then walks through to the study.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch pours himself a brandy and downs it in one. He goes to pour himself a second, when he notices something on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's his collection of PHOTOS by the TELEPHONE. They're all neatly stacked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a SINGLE GOLD EARRING on top.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch lies in bed, his thoughts racing as he waits for Alma to come home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening to the sound of the front door ... and Alma's footsteps down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before turning the light on. He watches her shadow through the strip of light at the bottom of door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside, peering down on him. She's not completely sure that he's actually awake, but she suspects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch eases himself up and looms over Alma to make sure she is safely asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He silently picks up her HANDBAG and takes it to the window. Using the moonlight he searches its contents. Car keys. Lipstick. Purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the first few pages of a story outline:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TAXI TO DUBROVNIK"
</DIRECTION>

The pages vibrate in his hand as his gaze lowers to reveal the rest of the TITLE PAGE: "STORY TREATMENT BY WHITFIELD COOK & ALMA REVILLE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLISTENING MOUND OF FOIE GRAS spooned into Hitchcock's mouth straight from the MAXIM'S OF PARIS tin. Hitch stands in the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave, shoving in mouthful after mouthful. It's almost pornographic in its indulgence.
</DIRECTION>

GEIN steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on Hitch's shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
We hear the civilized CLINK of cutlery against china...

Hitch and Alma sit at the table having lunch. Alma eats a pork chop while Hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad. He has a nice big glass of red wine which Alma ignores.

	Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "Alfred Hitchcock."

	Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't "an Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose. And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction.

ON HITCH with that same lost expression on his face, only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NAKED LIGHT BULB dangles from the ceiling as STAGE HANDS prepare the film's climactic scene in the cellar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch watches as VERA reaches out to touch the shoulder of Mrs. Bates. We zoom in on her as she reacts in silent horror, her HAND flying up to hit the light bulb, throwing crazy shadows all over the set.
</DIRECTION>

We push in on Hitchcock's face as the strobing light briefly illuminates the image of -

She considers the question and the man asking it, sensing something different about him now. She continues wiping off her make-up.

<DIRECTION>
Wind blows sand off the dunes. Alma sits in the parked car outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the seat next to her. An inkling that they may not be as magical as she had hoped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No matter. She checks her reflection in the rearview and applies some lipstick, readying herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck. She sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of Whit. Something doesn't feel right.
</DIRECTION>

She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot. Alma and Whit's eyes meet. Whit is horrified at being caught.

Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives. Lew discreetly checks his watch out of boredom. Shurlock and his two Assistants look appalled.

HITCH pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look at them.

His and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck.

But it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants to see most.

A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it:
</DIRECTION>

The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK THEATRE - DAY (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DAZZLING MARQUEE for "ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S PSYCHO." The car pulls up. Hitch and Alma step out. There's a long line of people outside the theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<ALMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least there are some people here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALMA>
<DIRECTION>
But Hitch's nerves are hardly soothed. The people in line start to notice the Hitchcocks...is it really them?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEGGY Comes over to greet them with the THEATRE MANAGER.
</DIRECTION>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can go through the side entrance.

<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW YORK THEATER, PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next to it... but the sound of the audience below TITTERING NERVOUSLY is anything but reassuring.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they're laughing too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
He peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody thing. INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch inches open the door and PEERS THROUGH THE CRACK at the audience but now he can't read them. Are they gripped with suspense -- or do they just hate it?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the lobby we see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HITCH as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor. A scared, lonely, corpulent figure. Totally powerless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's nothing for him to do but wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his business, entirely oblivious...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HITCH'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he grips the railing. This is taking far too long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HITCH As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out... leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a smile... the largest of his whole career.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitch, Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the theatre manager. There are still SCREAMS in the theatre as the show continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line of ticket buyers to get to the front doors. There is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the Hitchcocks...

	Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my wife won't take a shower after seeing your movie?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mr. Hithcock but there are photographers outside. They heard you were here.

EXT. THEATRE - DAY (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car. Hitchcock gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of behind him. She shyly waves him away but eventually, and appreciatively, relents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the flashbulbs start to POP --

	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be the biggest hit of your career, Alfred.

DISSOLVE TO: INT. CENTRAL STATE HOSPITAL WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room. Several nonviolent INMATES eat at different round tables around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ATTENDANT watches, and an ORDERLY mops the floor (there are NO female patients nor staff members.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REAL ED GEIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is at a table with two other patients, including a soft spoken older man, CHET. Ed is heavier, his hair is whiter, and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.

</ATTENDANT>
<ORDERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudine and I are driving to Chicago with her folks to see that Psycho movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him, nodding toward Ed. The Orderly's jaw drops! It is the coolest thing he's ever heard. He looks at Ed like he's a movie star. Meanwhile, Ed yawns, content. Utterly oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're the happiest guy I've ever known, Ed. How you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<ED_GEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you. You live your life, and it's unbearable sometimes but there's this secret, Chet; a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he leans a little closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... there is a God and he's so big and powerful, he doesn't always remember you're there...

He takes a huge bite blueberry pie.

	... but if you can get his attention and he sees you're suffering, he'll notice and he'll take care of you. My mother used to tell me -- she's passed, God bless her -- the one thing God truly loves and understands is suffering.

He takes a long drink of milk.

We pan to discover HITCHCOCK has been watching all this. He turns to the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say that we got to keep our house -- and the swimming pool. And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements.

He produces a CIGAR and wanders towards the exit doors.

</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know what they say in Hollywood: "You're only as good as your last picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project.

	Unfortunately I find myself once again bereft of all inspiration. I do hope something comes along soon...

</ALFRED_HITCHCOCK>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL BIRD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alights on his cigar tip and FLAPS its wings. Hitchcock can't resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which promptly flies away. He gives the camera a final characteristically deadpan look...
