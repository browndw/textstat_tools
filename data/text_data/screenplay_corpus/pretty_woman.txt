EXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house is extraordinary. A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests. Playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down at the party. Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around forty. He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured by a night's sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(a murmur)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left pocket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer. More laughter and applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The study is in keeping with the rest of the house. Luxurious. Everything the best. WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host. VANCE is an investment banker. His assistant JAKE, is a financial researcher. The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS. They are in dark suits and power ties. On the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name "KROSS INDUSTRIES" is prominent on many of the folders.
</DIRECTION>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California. We think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. With the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTMENT_BANKER_1>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(losing patience)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a "no brainer". There's no risk for you. No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. But ship building is a new endeavor for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTMENT_BANKER_2>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(cuts him off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<INVESTMENT_BANKER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, be reasonable. If you're really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. Besides, I don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTMENT_BANKER_3>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's unacceptable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward turns from the window. He hasn't miss a thing. All eyes are on him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half. I can secure the other half personally. You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The bankers speechlessly stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The meeting is over, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away. The bankers look at one another. They rise. Silence as they exit. When the door closes. Stuckey explodes with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hah! Did you see the look on their faces?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think we pushed too hard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO way! They'll come back. They can't afford not to. Edward, that bluff was beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should have made it rhyme.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The others stare at him, uncertain. Stuckey laughs. The others follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well! It's late. We've been at this long enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey rises. Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, enjoy the party. The magician's wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vance and Jake exit.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your left pocket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
A BUTLER has entered the room.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phone call, Mr. Harris. It's Miss Charles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTLER>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cynthia? Is she coming out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're about to find out. Go on. Take care of your guests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you, Cynthia?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing, getting angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call. Are you coming or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward descends the long, curved stairway. He has Vance in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(all business)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare the filing papers. Have them ready by the middle of the week. I'll tell you when to submit them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate toward Edward.
</DIRECTION>
<A_MAN>

<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>

<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't miss it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(abruptly; to Vance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want this done fast and easy. No slip-ups. I want to be back in New York by Saturday. Got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress. An elegant woman ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him. She taps him on the shoulder and he turns, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</STUCKEY>
<ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Edward leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIZABETH>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door. Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward comes out of the house. Jags, a limo with waiting DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black Ferrari. The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of Edward. Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his impatience under control. Stuckey comes out of the house and down the walk.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, where you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(as if delighted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. I just got off the phone with one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cynthia's not coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand. He crosses to a black Ferrari and gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let your driver take you. We'll move the cars...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Edward starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you drive a stick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward, give me a break!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway and... stalls again.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love this car! Is it new?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! And you don't even know where you're going!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill. Stuckey watching, throws up his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the wrong way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt. The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly. Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine. The light turns green. Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari. The Colt leaves him in the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FERRARI - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward drives. He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid himself of his own tired thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN, stops. Edward gets out of the car. He looks at the street signs. He has no idea where he is. He signs. He gets back in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crumbling old apartment building. Dark alley ways, deserted parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building, looking very out of place on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING UP A building facade of lit windows and metal fire escape. One window in particular. A GIRL stands there in a short kimono, looking down. And then she turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom mirror. She is twenty years old and a prostitute. Make-up applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed. She'd be innocently beautiful without it. She is wearing tiny shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots. She stares at herself, not really liking what she sees. A moment. She signs, turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faded, peeling walls. Thread bare, dirty carpet. Vivian locks the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway. A door suddenly opens, startling her. An unshaved, enormously pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LANDLORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian.

INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf. She pulls off the top. It's empty. She tosses the can away, starts for the door. She opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN. They both glance up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian quickly closes the door. She doesn't want to deal with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk. She hurried away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself. He wears an "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle in a doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little bags to various STREET-TYPES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie star. Some go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS. A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her. A car passes. The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest. She ignores him. The black prostitute approaches the car.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSTITUTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSTITUTE>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver looks her over. The Black Prostitute gets in the car and it drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night coffee shop. They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS as Vivian hurries by. She ignores them and goes next door into a falafel stand. Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you too, D'Nai. If Kit comes in here, tell her stay.

</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Both of them nod and smile at Vivian. Vivian exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skateboard zips by a GROUP. We SEE a police car parked at the entrance to an alcove. Also, an ambulance. The bubblegum lights are going. A CROWD has gathered. The happy man with the "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged in tense conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They just pulled her out of a dumpster in the back. Now talk to me.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried towards the waiting ambulance. For a moment Vivian thinks it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian surveys the dark street. And suddenly sees who's she's looking for. Walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs. The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig. The girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin. The young man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder. They giggle about something, both obviously high. Kit looks up, bleary-eyed. She stops. Vivian is standing in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You spent it on drugs, didn't you?

Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.

<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the greatest. I'll wait up for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
And then Kit is off, moving quickly away. Vivian turns. She stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents. And then it's as if Vivian turns a switch. She fluffs her mane of hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious and distracted. Vivian leans over the passenger window.

He pulls out his money clip.

Vivian suddenly freezes. On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and Skateboard. Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin. He motions to Skateboard, they start forward.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<VIVIAN>

<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Now I took like a hooker in a trenchcoat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. She stops in her tracks. The lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling. Even at this hour there is a great deal of activity. MEN in business suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by. Vivian's face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of all this luxury. Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes Edward's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's go.

</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward guides them across the lobby. They reach the elevators and go inside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform that seems just a bit too tight. As the elevator doors close he nods toward Edward.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR>

	Evening, sir.

</OPERATOR>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors. Edward pulls out his key and unlocks the doors. With a gentle push the door slide open in unison. Edward gestures to Vivian to go inside. She does. Edward closes the doors behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building. In front of her is a sunken living room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the city below. For the first time, she is speechless. Edward closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living room. Edward picks up a phone. Vivian checks out the room.
</DIRECTION>

Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room. She stares at the view.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Vivian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kidding? I come here all the time. As a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward smiles. He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans back. Vivian looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now that you have me for the night, what are you going to do with me?

</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>

</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He rises. Takes out his wallet. Standing over her, he drops THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap. She picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed. She puts the money in her jacket. She realizes Edward is standing over her as if waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants. He abruptly turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(a small smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.

Edward almost smiles. He sits across from her again.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've known a lot of everybody.

A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Champagne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to sit up. Vivian motions for him to stay put.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I might as well make myself useful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door. A WAITER comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where would you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<VIVIAN>

	<DIALOGUE>

</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room. He turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian, staring. Vivian stares back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he wanted you to tip him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tsk. Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.

Edward crosses to the silver stand. Vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.
</DIRECTION>

Edward lifts the bottle out. He deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they? Shopping together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They should be. They're both good at it.

</EDWARD>

Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	My ex-wife lives in London in what used to be my home. My girlfriend is in New York moving out of my apartment even as we speak. Cheers.

He drinks, nods approvingly.

<EDWARD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh, thank god.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward laughs softly. She sips it. To her surprise, really likes it. Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try a strawberry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. She slowly eats a strawberry. The juice of it stains her lips. Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry. His eyes haven't left her.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really are a very beautiful girl.

Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...

He's about to kiss her...

Edward and Vivian on the bed. He is on his back, his shoulder and head resting against the headboard. She is astride him, hands resting on his chest, rocking... in control, confident... very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes.

(touching her breasts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred. Just lay back and let me drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him. He tries not to groan. She's moving faster now. Edward suddenly pulls her violently to him, he rolls her over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward. He stands there quietly letting it wash over him. He turns off the shower, steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward stares. His expensive clothes are on the floor, haphazardly dropped everywhere. Vivian's clothes, as tattered as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair. The incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way. He looks toward the bed. Vivian is fast asleep. Her heavy makeup has long since been rubbed off. Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks like a sweet, gentle girl. He stares at her a moment longer. He turns, goes into the living room. Vivian opens her eyes. Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living room chair. He is reading contracts.
</DIRECTION>

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

The elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the hallway. He takes it to the doors of the penthouse. He rings the bell.

The Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and orange juice. Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless phone. Edward points the Waiter to the dining table.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

The Waiter returns. Edward signs the bill. The Waiter exits.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see him alone. Everyone knows you're my muscle. We'll make it social. Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner. Tonight if you can arrange it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't go alone. He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...

</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bring it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward hangs up. He pours a glass of orange juice and takes a sip, thinking. Something makes him turn. Vivian, wearing a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the bedroom doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>

</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No hurry. Would you like some breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
She's hungry and the breakfast looks great.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only if you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward sits. Waits. Vivian sits across from him. Edward serves them breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you sleep well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Occupational hazard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense, relaxes.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took the couch. I had some work to do.

<EDWARD>

	Mmm, I could tell.

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say you give a good dollar value.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
They share a small smile. They eat.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever... enjoy it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Occupational hazard".

A moment. Edward chuckles. Vivian grins.

	I buy companies.

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit. They expensive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He almost smiles. She almost smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. This time Vivian is impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are major league, baby. Your mother must be very proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closet door is open. Edward reaches for a tie. In the closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes, etc. She follows him in.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(fumbling with the tie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She undoes his knot and starts over.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ease, let me do that. Part of the all night services.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By breaking up a company's assets --

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are assets?

</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not... quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you learn to do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fucked the debate team in high school. Tsk. I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays. You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't drown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom. He follows her into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian turns on the water in the tub. It fills the tub in a torrential rush.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could hold a pep rally in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings. Edward reaches for it.

Vivian stares curiously at the bidet.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I gotta say this again, I don't like you going alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns it on. The water hits her in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(stifling a chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a big boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of the tub. Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me at least get you a date. Keep it social.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath. She smiles. Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to...? He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward, did you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a lot of nice girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water. There's something about the look on her face... the way she bites her lower lip... curious, sensual...
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the television. The sound blares. She fumbles to turn it down. Edward reaches over and turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. How much for the week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in town until Saturday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
She look at him like he isn't speaking English.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do-you-want-to-stay-here- for-the-week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Vivian a moment to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd cost you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five full nights... days too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward nods. Vivian hesitates... it's got to be enough to really change things... She shoots for the moon again.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>

And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on the sexy smile.

	Sugar, you got it. I will treat you like a prince. Anything, anyway you want.

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>

</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be out most of the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket for a money clip. He peels off bills. He hands the cash to Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to go out and buy some decent clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>

Edward opens the door, he starts to exit. He turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

She lies back into the soapy water and disappears. She suddenly pops back up, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three thousand!

A thought occurs to her. She reaches for the cordless phone. She dials. She waits. She is about to disconnect when the phone is answered.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby. She is back in her hooker clothes. She leaves an envelope at the front desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from his office. He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees Vivian exit out the front door. Vivian doesn't notice the odd stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are just entering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than a bit overwhelmed. She passes store windows... and MORE STORE WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS. Each display is more beautiful and expensive than the one before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks. From PASSERBY'S. Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at her, turn away and giggle. The uniformed GUARDS that stand at attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh woman's boutique. She hesitates for a moment. She enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<SALESWOMAN>

	May I help you?

</SALESWOMAN>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just looking, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with delicate glass objects. She cautiously examines a dress. The Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you looking for something in particular?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESWOMAN>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Something... conservative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>

Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone. She examines a dress.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have beautiful things.

<DIRECTION>
(no reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much is this?

</SALESWOMAN>
<VIVIAN>

(beginning to get the drift)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.

</VIVIAN>
<SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very expensive.

<SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think we have anything for you here. You're obviously in the wrong place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESWOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is speechless. She turns and stomps toward the door. She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman. Vivian flips her off. She throws the door open and storms outside. The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns to her place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. She takes a deep breath, trying to control herself. Two WOMEN, in elegant designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a freak. Vivian suddenly feels naked. She turns and hurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid. She feels an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury around her. She hurries toward the elevators.

At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her. He crosses the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>

</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian's face is filled with confusion. She doesn't know his name. The elevator doors open behind them. She spots the Operator.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(blurting it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knows me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously. The Operator looks back at them innocently. With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas waves the Operator over.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know this young lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
The Operator nods.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's with Mr. Harris.

(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris?

</MR_THOMAS>
<OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She apparently joined him last night.

Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away.

<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you come with me. We'll chat for just a moment.

He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off.

INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris, however, is a very special customer. And we like to think of our special customers as friends. As a customer, we would expect Mr. Harris to sign in any additional guests. But as a friend, we're willing to overlook it, I'm assuming you're a... relative?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian finds herself nodding.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought so. You must be his...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Niece?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian bites her lower lip, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. We understand one another.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as a gentle afterthought:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I was trying to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She can't help it, the tears come. Vivian pulls out the money Edward gave her. She drops it on the desk. It's a moist- looking wad now.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was trying to get some other clothes... but... they wouldn't... they made me feel like shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She can't go on. Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money. He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her. He sighs. He picks up the phone. He dials.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bridget, hello, this is Barnard Thomas over at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Well, thank you, that's flattering. I'd like to ask a favor of you. I'm going to send someone over. Her name is Vivian. She's a guest of ours. A very special guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at Vivian. With those simple words, he'd made her feel better.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's from out of town and she needs a little help in dressing. Perhaps you could help her out. Thank you very much. She'll be right over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>

He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's edge. They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes it.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... this is the jewel in Kross's crown. We can strip out all the heavy equipment. Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas. The Japanese are salivating for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles. It gives me a hard-on.

<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that long building over there?

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Storage, I think.

</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Vance pulls out a notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The real estate possibilities are endless. Most of the yard we'll just level. I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --

</JAKE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talked to some developers about the land.

</JAKE>
<STUCKEY>

<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right, Jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. It won't happen again, Edward. I'll pull him off the project immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is interesting. That building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant. They closed it down after World War II.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away. I want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, yes. It's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>

He turns away. The other follow Edward back toward the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

	Well... I might be going out to dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<BRIDGET>

	You'll want a cocktail dress then. Turn. You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes?

Mr. Thomas is behind the desk. He looks up. Vivian is standing there, a happy look on her face. She holds up a garment bag.

Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very welcome, Miss Vivian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him. He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward the elevator. The provocative way her hips move just naturally attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY. And the white gloved ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile. Mr. Thomas sighs.

	I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The young lady staying in your room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Edward's eyes narrow. He hangs up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we both know she's not my niece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this hotel have any problem with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly. The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He starts towards the lounge.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very intriguing young woman, Miss Vivian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
His tone stops Edward in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good evening, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell transpired during the afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward enters the lounge. He looks around, not seeing Vivian. And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress at the piano bar. Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian rises, moves elegantly towards him. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without thinking:
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're forgiven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She waits expectantly. He holds out an arm. She takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes out of the ladies room. She walks forward past the MAITRE'D'S station. She stops. She takes a breath... and then walks forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant restaurant toward a far table. Her beauty and natural grace draw approving stares. She is like a queen moving through a ballroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men. JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire industrialist. Sitting next to him is his son and second in command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties. All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table. David Kross holds out Vivian's chair for her. Surprised, she nods her thanks. In front of her is an enormous placesetting. She smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of them. Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork. But then she sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and is digging into his salad with that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian looks to see what Edward will do. He doesn't seem interested in eating yet. Neither does David Kross. Feeling a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So young man, I understand you are trying to take over my company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for a moment. But then he almost smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't patronize me, Mr. Kross. Our ages mean nothing here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kross and David look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-five percent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris, I built Kross Enterprises myself. I know every man who ever worked there by his first name. I know their wives... and their children. If your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins to eat. Relieved, Vivian picks up hers. They all eat for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put down the next course. Vivian, thinking she's got to finish, quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad. She is reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would it take to buy our stock back? Name your price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. We would give you a promissory note...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not getting any navy contracts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this news.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way you could know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, the escargot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Escargot are put down in front of everyone. Vivian stares at them dubiously. She picks up what she assumes is the next "right" fork. She picks up a snail. The two do not fit. Flustered, she doesn't know what to do. No one else seems to be eating. And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks at each place. Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(softly, to the Waiter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scume me, what are these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
(bending to whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Escargot, mademoiselle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning close to whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian stares at them, horrified. She, like James and David Kross, no longer seem interested in eating. Edward eats with pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a lot of nerve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. What I have is a lot of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(angry now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not your company. It's a public company. And I am going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian struggles with her escargot.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me, rather than fight a battle you don't have the ammunition to win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table. Everyone looks to her.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slippery little suckers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kross rises.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deal with this, David, you know where we stand. I need to go someplace and puke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
He rises. He exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edward and Vivian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men like my father built this country. He was no saint. He screwed people. But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Edward is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seems like a nice man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can reach an understanding on this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. I take it all very personally.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Vivian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David Kross gets up and leaves. Vivian and Edward sit in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's the way the game is played.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some game. Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward says nothing. But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snails for dinner. No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
A Waiter appears at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we ready for the next course, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Bring a check, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of the glass window down at the city lights. He quickly drains his champagne glass. Vivian moves to stand next to him. She refills his glass from the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're upset, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You liked the guy, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant. It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're the exactly the same! Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing what she's
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	saying and quickly
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
recovers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except with you. At your price I give my all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not talks about this heavy stuff. Come on, relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes up behind him. She begins to rub his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That... is very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. Edward is silent. Turns him, unknots his tie, unbuttons his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what we're gonna do in a little while then? We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza. We're gonna eat it in bed. We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Television?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh. No work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, she softly kisses his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See... what you haven't figured out yet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She kissed his neck. She fumbles with his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that while you're the boss everyplace else... I'm the one in charge here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... just think you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to kneel down. He stops her. They stare at one another for a moment. He releases her. She smiles. She starts to undress him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is asleep. She turns over, slowly waking. Her hand goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed. Vivian comes awake with a sudden start. She look around momentarily frightened, not sure where she is. Sighing with relief, she lies back down. She sees Edward's American Express card on the pillow next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up, Vivian. Time to shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed. He is tying his tie. Vivian sits up and ties it for him. He smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was someone rude to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a little problem in one store. I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say. I don't belong there. Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget. She was cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward sits on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He softly touches her, right between the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an old trick I use, especially with bankers. Works every time. Will you try it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(confidently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

	Please.

INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful, chic women's shop. The haughty SALESGIRL approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses. Edward hovers in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Can you help me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down. A Pause. Vivian gives her "the stare" and straightens up. We see the Salesgirl's reaction change.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(confidently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for a dress, nothing too flashy, not too sexy, conservative. In a size six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<SALESGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable under Vivian's stare)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do... do you have a charge account with us?

</SALESGIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card. The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to find Vivian's size.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the Salesgirl's supervision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low cut, spangled and fringed outfit. Edward shakes his hand. The Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit. Vivian scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>

Stuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to Edward on the speaker phone.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a tough old son of a bitch...

Edward is watching Vivian. She pulls the hem of her skirt up to mid thigh. She looks hopefully over to Edward. Edward shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's up to ten and a quarter.

	Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there. We can bleed'm dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes. He watches as Vivian tries on a hat. She preens for him. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Vance & Stuckey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>

	We're letting them slide?

Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian. She moves to him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on your own now, Vivian. I've got to get to work. Be sensible and you can keep everything. Spend too much and it all goes back.

</EDWARD>

Vivian hugs him again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive. She looks lovely in the pink dress and new, white shoes. A pretty, white hat is the final touch. She carries a bag containing her old clothes. She stops at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEES Vivian in each department within the store with different SALESPEOPLE. She happily and confidently tries on a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) Vivian is in a dressing stall. She tosses a dress out to a waiting SALESWOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

	Where'd you get your tie?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags. She feels like she owns the block. A well-dressed MAN passes by, smiling politely. Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores him.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly Vivian stops. She's about to pass the shop she was thrown out of. Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian enters. The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's courage leaves her.

</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That's right. It's me. I want you to know something. You made me feel terrible. I wasn't dressed right and you said I didn't belong here. Well, I do. You're the one that was wrong, not me. And I want to tell you something else. I'm never gonna shop here again as long as I live.

And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.

a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in progress.

Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party. Edward is wearing his new tie. Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful in one of her new outfits. Not that it's helping -- the place, the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her overwhelmed. She suddenly stops.

	You're awfully quiet. You haven't said a word since the party.

As Edward touches her shoulder, Vivian suddenly spins and explodes with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?! What are you trying to prove!? I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stuckey! He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>

Edward looks guiltily away.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was I supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my fucking money. I'm getting out of here. I don't want anything more to do with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>

A tear falls from Vivian's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>

	Well, it's true. Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.

<EDWARD>

	Fine. I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.

<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of the bedroom. As she does she starts crying. With each item of clothing the tears come down harder. Edward appears at the doorway. His face is genuinely concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I should have known that it would hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really am sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>

Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms. Sobbing, she stands limply.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders. She touches his hand. He sits on the bed. He pulls her to him and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make it up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. I'll be in the office tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.

</MR_THOMAS>
<EDWARD>

	Afternoon.

Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display in the hotel jewelry store window. He detours from the elevators and moves to the window for a closer look. He thinks a moment and enters the jewelry store.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing an elegant red sequined evening dress. She looks incredibly beautiful. She sees the phone. A thought occurs to her and going to it, she picks it up. Waits.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Kit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. She hears someone at the door. She hangs up. Edward enters. He is carrying a small case. He stops at the sight of Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(a small smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
	</DIALOGUE>

He holds up the small case.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?

</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian's jaw drops. Edward is holding a diamond and ruby necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he breathed too hard. Edward behind Vivian, fastens the necklace around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is made for a princess. I think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight. There. Come look.
	</DIALOGUE>

He leads her to a mirror. She stares at her reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward, I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shush. Of course you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I lose it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if someone tries to steal it?

Taking her arm, Edward leads her across the tarmac.

</VIVIAN>

The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORPORATE JET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet. Vivian can't believe the cabin. It is a comfortable room featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in bar, television and stereo. Edward is once again, going over papers.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been on a plane before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you like it. Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian fluffs her hair up. She makes a happy, excited growling sound -- Rrrrr! A wicked gleam comes to her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him. He looks up. She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken quarters. She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, what do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs.
</DIRECTION>

She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face. Edward sets down his papers.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CORPORATE JET - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is at the window, looking out. She carefully puts her earrings back on. She stares, mesmerized by the skyline, the golden gate bridge in the distance. She turns. Edward is buttoning his shirt. He is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian. I'm paying you to be you. Be you.

</DIRECTION>

</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean, besides Elvis?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning back to the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a human being. Sure. Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy. He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago. They stopped at a gas station. He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other. Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time. He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things. The two of us getting married someday. Having kids. Stupid stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. Vivian shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father found me. Dragged me home. I don't know why, he never seemed to like me much when I was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a bitter smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cept when he was drunk, then he liked me a whole lot.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made it back to Atlanta a year later. Andy was gone.

Silence. Vivian stares out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, but things sure look fine when you're sitting way up high.

Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her shoulders, stares with her out at the view. Vivian rests her head against him.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through the elegant lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but I don't believe it. You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time. They either love it or hate it. Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain with several graceful statues in its center. Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and prosperous looking MEN. It makes her nervous. Without realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace. She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and steal it.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viv? I really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their seats. Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative glances from the MEN. Her hands again rises nervously to her necklace.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian gives him a grateful look. Relaxing, she lowers her hand from the necklace. With a flourish, he offers his arm. She takes it. They start forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you. But you'll be surprised how much you understand. The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't they have it in English?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. That's the fun of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The lights dim.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The orchestra begins to play. Vivian's eyes focus intensely on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face. Edward leans over to translate the tenor's aria.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I? I am a poet. Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams. You have come to replace my vanished dreams. I dwell now only in your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC ebbs and swells. The sets and costumes change. The story continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward again leans close to Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth. Her eyes are fixed on the stage. She doesn't need his help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is reaching its tragic climax. Her lips tremble. Her eyes fill with tears. Edward glances at her. He studies her a long moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face. Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined mascara. She sighs, happy. The WOMEN in the next box smile at her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you enjoy the opera, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_WOMAN>
<VIVIAN>

Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he and the still misty Vivian exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward and Vivian sit side by side.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I more than liked it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm glad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian looks at him a moment. And then, leaning slowly forward she kisses him gently on the mouth. He looks at her surprise. He puts his arms around her and kisses her back. It is the first time they've kissed and they make it very special.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together. Edward cradles Vivian. Her back rests against his chest. His arm is over her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back. She gently kisses the palm.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast. She closes her eyes, ready to sleep now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes open. Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with him with sudden confusion and uncertainty. He stares into the dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is still asleep. She is face down on the bed, the sheets just covering her to her waist. Edward stares down at her. He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line of her spine. Vivian murmurs contentedly.

</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is wearing her yellow dress. She stares at herself in the bedroom mirror. Her hair... her make-up... she realizes how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward comes out of the bathroom. He crosses to the closet for a tie.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him. He is very aware of the closeness of her. She smiles at him. He smiles; puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment. Looking up, she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes. He releases her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more night and you're finally rid of me.

	It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, I've thought about this a lot. This is the best solution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head "no,"
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	then continues tying
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his tie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She finished his tie.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(softly; to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't mind me. I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay? It's a real good offer for a whore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never treated you like a whore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(not mean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward enters the living room. Vivian slowly enters behind him. Edward opens the front door. Mr. Kross slowly enters. He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask his surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, Mr. Kross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. I'll get used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father. Stuckey brings up the rear. Edward and David give one another perfunctory nod. Stuckey smugly winks at Edward. Edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance. He gently nods at Vivian.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Vivian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not waste time here, shall we? Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris is now listening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone. He turns to Edward.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Expected... offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, yes. After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making the right decision, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward. He is surprised to see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face. Edward is silent. Kross interprets his silence as second thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you on one condition. I'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be taken care of. Won't they, Edward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kross ignores Stuckey. He looks to Edward. Edward slowly nods.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll sign anything you want then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kross nods tiredly. His voice is very soft.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom, obviously upset. The men all watch her go. Edward hesitates. He turns to Kross:
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He heads to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Is Kit DeLuca there? When she comes in will you have her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000. Yes. Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up as Edward comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you liked him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. The man made a business decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back in a few hours. We'll talk about this later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward enters the living room. The men look at him expectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll continue this down at the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY

Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city beyond. The phone RINGS. She turns and hurries inside.

INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vivian answers the phone.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Thomas is standing behind the front desk, a rather strained expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There's someone here to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<MR_THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
A hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr. Thomas. Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viv? Where are you, babe?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glaring at Mr. Thomas)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sphincter-police won't let me through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kit finishes slurping on a big, frosty ice cream soda. She smacks her lips like a happy, little girl. Vivian isn't having anything.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I just got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
An OLDER COUPLE walk past the table. They stare at Kit.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty bucks, grampa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified, the elderly couple hurry away.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody keeps starin' at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I know what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you know? You look good. All dressed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You clean up real nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(giggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do. Not that you ever did anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you fit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is silent, then.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(miserably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was great.

</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dummy.

</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go for the bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care about bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might love this guy.

</VIVIAN>
<KIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, are you in deep shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know he'll break your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is silent again.
</DIRECTION>
<KIT>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I blame myself here. First time I laid eyes on ya', I knew you were too complicated to be a whore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIT>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian nods. Her face is filled with confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward stands at the window looking out. There is something about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of the story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm. He begins laying them out on the conference table.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished. You've won.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Edward says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you going after next, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who indeed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter the room. They surround a conference table. Kross sits, the papers laid out in front of him. Stuckey hands Kross a pen. A SECRETARY lays out finger food. They wait for her to leave before they speak.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate. You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could we at least wait till after the filing period?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey glances to Edward for help. Edward is silent; indeed it's as if something is twisting inside of him. Stuckey plunges ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth. The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid. The more we know, the higher our bid can be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in my best interest to cooperate, David.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's unfair!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bed it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're everything he said you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his father)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. A moment. Kross looks at Edward with a resigned smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's young. He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet. I'll sign your papers. And I'll answer your questions. Whatever you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs. He picks up the pen. He's about to sign.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. For just a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think there's any sense in --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I would take advantage of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kross looks uncertain. He gropes for an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<KROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my god... Edward, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you lost your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Stuckey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I get the loans?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This time I imagine you would, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as if thinking about it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<KROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(a small smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KROSS>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very right. I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

He exits from the room. Stuckey follows.

Edward is walking down the hall. Stuckey comes out of the office and calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(calls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward, what happened? What kind of move was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Edward silently goes into the elevators. The doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(yells)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit Edward, speak to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>

Stuckey heads back to the conference room.

Edward comes out of the building. His Chauffeur leaps to open the limo door.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

	No... take the car back to the hotel. I need to walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He sets off across Century Park East.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings. She turns. It rings again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it. Stuckey is standing outside with a small briefcase. He looks agitated. He tries to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well... Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian just stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward's not back. I thought he was with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'll just have to wait then, won't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>

There is a bar set up. Stuckey sets his briefcase down. He crosses to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>

	Mind if I have a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He pours liquor in a glass. He fires it down. It seems to calm him a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter. For no reason! What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pours another drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was all that benevolent crap? What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation? I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Stuckey glares at Vivian.

	Aw, come on, Bill. It's just business.

He looks at her a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what do I know, maybe you're worth it. Come on, show me. Let's see your act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>

He grabs her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<STUCKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'll pay for it. What a you charge? Huh? Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? Are you a fifty dollar whore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUCKEY>

He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him.

She bites his hand. Stuckey slaps her. Vivian starts flailing back. But Stuckey is too strong. Vivian staggers back at the force of another slap. Stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her.

Stuckey falls on the ground. Edward rushes forward, berserk with rage, to hit Stuckey again. His fist hits the top of Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom. Again Stuckey tries to rise. Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into the bar. Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor. Stuckey again tries to rise. And collapses. Edward rubs his fist. They're not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.

INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought. Her bags are packed, ready to go. With a sigh she rises. She picks up the bags, exits the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking it all in for the last time. She suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving. She musters resolve. She goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her. Silence. Vivian suddenly comes back in. She puts down her bags. She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can/piggy bank from the shelf. She puts some more bills into it, places it back where Kit will find it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and starts again for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. She hears something. MUSIC. An aria from La Boheme. Faint. Seemingly coming from nowhere. She dismisses it -- she's hearing things. She opens the door. Stops. The music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her imagination. She hurries over to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian comes out onto the fire escape. She stares in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A snow white limo comes up the street. A necktie has been tied to the antennae like a knight's token. The MUSIC from La Boheme is BLARING from the car's stereo. Edward is standing on the car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof. The wind blows at his hair. He is smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building. Vivian's landlord comes out the front door. His eyes go wide in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the sunroof. He leaps nimbly to the ground. He crosses to the entrance of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are really lost this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape. She stops at the bottom stair. Edward comes forward and sweeps her into his arms. They kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless. Her feet never touch the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car door closes behind them. The limo drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people of the street watch it go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
