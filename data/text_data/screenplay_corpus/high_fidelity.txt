STEREO.

Not a minisystem, not a matching set, but coveted audiophile clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi, each component from a different era, bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds of being flush.

<DIRECTION>
RECORDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big thin LPs. Fields of them. We move across them, slowly... they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books... but then the CD's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever then the singles, then the tapes...
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	But nobody worries about kids listening to thousands -- literally thousands -- of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
It seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until... we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that grows on you. He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us, the wall of music behind him.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Group of bags huddled next to the door. Not the go-on-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out variety. Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones. We hear what he is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately pulls the headphones off. She clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence. She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye. Laura begins to cry a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>

	I don't really know what I'm doing.

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door. A strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the door shuts behind Rob. He stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound of Laura and her dragging bags.

Rob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal. He addresses us again.

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those were the ones that really hurt. Can you see your name in that list, Laura? Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten, but there's no place for you in the top five. Sorry. Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliations and heartbreaks that you're just not capable of delivering.

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
He adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That probably sounds crueler than it's meant to, but the fact is, we're too old to take each other miserable. Unhappiness used to mean something. Now it's just a drag like a cold or having no money.

He moves through the living room to an open window facing the street. Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be nice to think that since I was fourteen, times have changed, relationships have become more sophisticated, females less cruel, skins thicker, but there still seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that has happened to me since.

Rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get by because of the people who make a special effort to shop here on Saturday young men, always young men, who spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted Smiths singles and "original not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa albums.

INT. RECORD STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In almost darkness. More light might penetrate the windows if there weren't so many record-release posters taped to them. A dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug. On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people you've never heard of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.

As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a CD from the sea and

replaces it almost the same position, but not quite -- meticulousness and pride in this gesture...
</DIRECTION>

After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo.

	We went out for two years, and for every single minute I felt as though I was standing on a dangerously narrow ledge. I couldn't get comfortable, couldn't ever stretch out and relax. Why would a girl -- no, a woman -- like Charlie go out with someone who only a few years ago sewed a Foghat patch on his jacket?

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I really learned from the Charlie Debacle is that you gotta punch your weight. Charlie was out of my Class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. What am I? Average. A middleweight. Not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest. I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, I think -- they're about girls, right? -- just kidding -- but I don't like them very much. My all time top five favorite books are Johnny Cash's autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't know, probably something by Kurt Vonnegut. I look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and I'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole I prefer American films. Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining. I'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat. My genius, if I can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame. You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen. Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs. I don't do any of these things, really. If I do okay with women it's not because of the virtues I have, but because of the ugly flaws I don't have... So. Charlie and I didn't match. After her I was determined to never get out of my league again.

	Charlie and I didn't match. Marco and Charlie matched. Me and Sarah, number four on the all time break- ups list, matched. She wore more or less the same clothes as mine, had an acceptable working knowledge of music, and she had been dumped by some asshole named Michael. He was her moment, Charlie was mine. Sarah had sworn off men. I had sworn off women. It made sense to pool our loathing of the opposite sex, swear them off together, and get to share a bed with someone at the same time.

	You run the risk of losing anyone who is worth spending time with. But I didn't know that at the time. All I saw was that I'd moved down a division and that it still hadn't worked out, and this seemed cause for a great deal of misery and self- pity. And that's when Laura came along.

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm reorganizing my records tonight. It's something I do in times of emotional distress. When Laura was here I had them in alphabetical order, before that, chronologically. Tonight, though, I'm trying to put them in the order in which I bought them. That way I can write my own autobiography without picking up a pen. Pull them all off the shelves, look for Revolver and go from there. I'll be able to see how I got from Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty- five moves. What I really like about my new system is that it makes me more complicated than I am. To find anything you have to be me, or at the very least a doctor in Rob-ology. If you wanna find Landslide by Fleetwood Mac you have to know that I bought it for someone in the fall of 1983 and then didn't give it to them for personal reasons. But you don't know any of that, do you? You would have to ask me to--

She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on. He misses a breath. The walls are lined with mahogany cases custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum.

Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo. Her brow furrows, and then she smiles.

<FEMALE_CUSTOMER>

	This sounds great.

Dick smiles humbly. Two people in the store turn and approach.

	Is this the new Green Day?

</CUSTOMER>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY still talking to his Customer, who now has several CD's in his hand. He looks at Barry with a mixture of hate and adoration.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television?

	I have a television.

Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack.

A FEW MINUTES LATER - ROB AND DICK

stand behind the counter. Rob holds a CD in his hand, and surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of authority.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.

</ROB>
<DICK>

Rob pops the CD in and it begins to play... He stands there with his arms folded, waiting. After a moment, a Customer approaches.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rob's face gets hot and mad. He jumps out from behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dick, ring the man up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
He moves like a cat through the crowd. Justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door. Vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Rob now, and he and Justin bolt for the door. Rob doubles back.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DICK! THE DOOR!

Dick sees Vince and Justin too late. Rob is right behind them and as they get out the door, he reaches... and comes up with the back half of a skateboard.

EXT. RECORD STORE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand. They have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board behind.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fuckos. How much is this deck worth to you, and how many CD's did you rip off? Can you do the math?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>

Justin pulls two CD's out and slides them over to Rob.

<ROB>

	And what about you, dork?

</ROB>

Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot.

Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them.

Dicks pokes his head out of the door.

Vince and Justin look at each other.

<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw. Those are for us.

	Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now?

</ROB>
<JUSTIN>

	You're, like, so bigoted to look at us and, like, think you know what we listen to.

	You got the CD's so can I have my board back?

</VINCE>
<ROB>

Justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book, "How To Make A Record." He tosses it over.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months! Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.

<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we...

</VINCE>
<JUSTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know how it works. Nobody even knows, so we wanted to check it out in that mag.

</JUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rob snorts.
</DIRECTION>
<JUSTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like, do you know how to actually make a CD?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUSTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the underappreciated expert.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Records are those big round black things, right?

Rob turns to go back in the store.

	Well we rang $900 today.

Rob, now alone, turns the sign from "open" to "closed" shuts the door behind him, and pulls the gate across. Laura appears from the next doorway. He jumps.

	My house?

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Laura turns and begins walking. Rob looks at camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all: The money. The money is easy to explain: She had it and I didn't, and she wanted to give it to me. If she hadn't, I would have gone under. I've never paid her back because I've never been able to, and just because she's took off and moved in with some Supertramp fan doesn't make me five grand richer. So that's the money --

Laura's CAR HORN is heard. He heads off.

INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move down the street, and it's a little tense. Laura pushes a tape into the stereo. Art Garfunkel's "Bright Eyes" begins to play. Rob turns away from her and makes a face, but she knows he's making it.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can make all the faces you want. My car. My car stereo. My compilation tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Rob tries not to speak, but --
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Alright, alright but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
He reels on her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right? I'd like a word with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't you remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Rob shakes his head in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see why you prefer Gaye to Garfunkel. I get it, really. But there are so many other things to worry about. They're only records, and if one is better than the other, well, who cares, besides you and Barry and Dick? I mean really, who gives a flying fuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I liked you. You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you weren't interested in music at all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure. More so then than I am now. That's life though, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
The car slows, and Laura parks.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do you like it that way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really.

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
She half smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of the car. Rob turns to camera, speaking quietly and urgently.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Number two: The stuff I told her about being unhappy in the relationship, about half looking around for someone else: She tricked me into saying it. We were having this state of the union type conversation and she said, quite matter-of-factly, that we were pretty unhappy at the moment, and did I agree, and I said yes, and she asked whether I ever thought about meeting someone else. So I asked her if she ever thought about it, and she said of course, so I admitted that I daydream about it from time to time. Now I see that what we were really talking about was her and Ian, and she suckered me into absolving her. It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and I fell for it, because she's much smarter than me.

He scrambles out of the car.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The lock turns and Rob enters, holding the door for Laura who slips by, her coat in her hands. She glances down at the table by the door and sees Ian's envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can take it with you if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
She slips it into her purse. He stands facing her for a moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on a chair. She opens the closet and takes out a big laundry sack.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
She begins putting books and other things into the bag...
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet. I've been saying that for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Having no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Where have you been staying for the last week?

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Laura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I haven't been very fair to you. That's why I came here to the store this evening. I feel terrible, Rob. This is really hard, you know.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Is it my job?

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were the others?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just the obvious stuff.

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the obvious stuff?

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
She stands and walks toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it's not that obvious, then.

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And number three: The Pregnancy. I didn't know she was pregnant. Of course I didn't. She hadn't told me because I had told her I was... sort of... seeing somebody else. We thought we were being very grown-up, but we were being preposterously naive, childish even, to think that one of us could fuck around and then own up to it while we were living together. So -- I didn't find out about it 'til way later. We were going through a good period and I made a crack about having kids and she burst into tears. I made her tell me what it was all about, and she did. I felt guilty and so I got angry. She told me that at the time I didn't look like a very good long- term bet. That it was a hard decision and she didn't see any point in consulting me about it... When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big --

Laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you say something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rob. Don't be childish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not living with him. I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. You know that, don't you? I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run. Probably nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag. Rob turns back to camera.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self-deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and Ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>

Laura reappears, her bag half-filled with clothes, and goes to the book shelves next to the records. She starts topping off the bag with books.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me. Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know. All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right? It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it? It means he might live. Even if it's only a remote possibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MARIE>

	God, I hate that time. That pick up stuff time. I just went through that before I came here. You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play? That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.

Rob glances at T-Bone, his mind calculating the new info.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women. And do they all look like Richard Gere? Are they all as rich as Bill Gates? Charming as Oscar Wilde? Hell no. Nothing to do with any of that. Maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves... well, about nine million, give or take fifty. And they're just men. Regular guys. We're just guys, because I, even I, am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club. In fact, Marie is my seventeenth lover. "How does he do it?" you ask. "He wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan. What's going on? Listen up, because I think I can explain, with all modesty aside: I ask questions. That's it. That's my secret. It works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom. There are still enough old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different. If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway?

<BARRY>

	I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say?

	You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana? Maybe a Liz Phair track. There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff. The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you... But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. Ah. Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan. Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings. He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.

Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me, and Charlie, who I have to thank for everything: my great job, my sexual self-confidence, the works. There's this Springsteen song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the USA. About a girl who's left town years before and he's pissed off because he didn't know about it, and he wanted to say goodbye, tell her that he missed her, and wish her good luck. Well, I'd like my life to be like a Springsteen song. Just once. I know I'm not born to run, and it's clear that Halsted Street is nothing like Thunder Road, but feelings can't be that different, can they? I'd like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether they've forgiven me, and tell them that I have forgiven them. And say good luck, goodbye. No hard feelings. And then they'd feel good and I'd feel good. We'd all feel good. I'd feel clean, and calm, and ready to start again. That'd be good. Great even.

And then that little shitbag asked me out, and I was too tired to fight him off, and it wasn't rape because I said okay, but it wasn't far off.

	Yeah, sure...

	Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you?

</ROB>
<CHARLIE>

	Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now. Listen. Do you want to come to dinner Saturday? I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?

<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS OVER THE COURSE OF DINNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sexy version of a hip wine commercial: a small mid-thirties crowd of successful, beautiful people. Rob sits at the table silently as the other guests talk and eat. Rob's central activities are working his way through maybe a few too many wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesn't get in anyone's face. His eyes occasionally dart around the table, but he says nothing to anyone.

</CHARLIE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving. In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it. Do all men go through this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like. What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look of "contemplation."
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more. In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him. It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow. You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean. Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange. And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.

	A little sunnier. Sparkier.

	I don't know. You know what people are like at that age. They make very superficial judgements. Do you think that's superficial? He was a clown, if it's any consolation.

</CHARLIE>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?

	I wanted the works and I got it. None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none of Sarah's rewriting of history, and no reminder that I'd got all the rejection stuff a little backward, like I did about Penny. Just a perfectly clear explanation of why some people have it and some don't. All I've learned from Charlie is that maybe my one talent, my genius for being normal, is a little overrated.

	Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it.

	Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance?

<BARRY>

	I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments.

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.

	They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea.

	That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --

</BARRY>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there.

	So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?

	Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.

<ROB>

	Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>

	He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so.

Laura sits down, on the other side of the couch.

	Fix it up. It'll make you feel better.

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I didn't mind. And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray. I hate Ian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."

Laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very close to Rob. Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh. It's everything else I don't know about.

She goes to her bags. Rob points to a pile of CDs.

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you. I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand? That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me. I like Sting and you hate him. But the rest of this stuff...

	Okay, okay. I get the picture.

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to go on about it. But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it. You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being deliberately obtuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I am.

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the point in thinking about it? If I ever have another relationship, I'll buy her, whoever she is, stuff that she oughta like but doesn't know about -- that's what new boyfriends are for. And hopefully I won't borrow money from her, or have an affair, and she won't need to have an abortion or run away with the neighborhood, and then there won't be anything to think about. Laura didn't run off with Ian because I bought her CDs she wasn't that keen on, and to pretend otherwise is just... just... psychowank. If she thinks that, then she's missing the Brazilian rainforest for the twigs. If I can't buy the Plastic People of the Universe's first album for new girlfriends, then I might as well give up, because I'm not sure I know how to do anything else.

</ROB>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They don't know him. And Ken liked you. Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know. It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.

INT. CHAPEL TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz and Rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish nondenominational room. At the front is a coffin, resting on a stand. Laura, her younger sister JO, and her mother sit in the front row, listening to the MINISTER.
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now and forever, Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
He nods "offstage," and a muffled mechanical noise is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low, baleful human HOWL is heard, starting quietly but gaining in volume.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear something in Laura's voice, but I know what it is, and at that moment I want to go to her and offer to become a different person, to remove all trace of what is me, as long as she will let me look after her and try to make her feel better...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAPEL PARLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rob stays back, watching mourners approach Laura and her mother, hugging them. After awhile, Laura sees Rob through the throng, hanging back. She breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time...
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And when she let's go of me, I feel I don't need to become a different person. It's happened already.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LAURA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cozy old Victorian house, full of things -- furniture, paintings, ornaments, plants -- which don't go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste. Rob and Liz stand, drinking wine. Jo approaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<JO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right, I suppose. And Mom's not too bad. But Laura... I dunno.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JO>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's had a pretty rough few weeks already, without this. It's hard when you're putting all of your efforts into one part of your life and it doesn't work out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at Rob, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(sincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mind me. No problem. Just pretend you're talking about somebody else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Jo smiles, Liz gives him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are talking about somebody else. Laura. Laura and Ray, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rob begins to turn red. Anger, sorrow, everything else building.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough, Liz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(getting louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered. Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowering his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and near tears. He sees Laura in a corner of the room surrounded by four or five mourners. He crosses to them and breaks through to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>

He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining torrents and big sheets. Rob emerges from the front door of Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, hands thrust into his pockets. The rain almost immediately soaks him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, Rob runs toward us. As he gets to us we move with him down the street. He is drenched. We hear the rain, and his ragged breath. Headlights appear behind him and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine gets louder. Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the black wet earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and staring up at the sky. Off-camera the car engine catches up, and a door opens and shuts. He sighs and shuts his eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, staring down at him. It is difficult to distinguish rain from tears.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
But Rob keeps lying there. Laura pulls herself to a sitting position on the wall just above him.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're soaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmnn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're also an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon.

</LAURA>

They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's VW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drive sort of aimlessly through Laura's old neighborhood. Laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up a narrow road through some overgrown trees. They come to a stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field with an old abandoned school on the other side. Laura shuts down the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are you going back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to feel something else than this. It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire. Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll have to be sex, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck. She pauses and regards him from above.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.

Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, with Ray...

</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we can do other things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lived with you. You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry. Isn't that a terrible thing? Isn't that sad?
	</DIALOGUE>

She rolls off of him into her seat. They sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later, I wonder if I was really worried about where Ian has been. I have no idea where he's been, and that gives me every right to insist on protection. But in truth, it was the power that interested me more than the fear. I wanted to hurt her, on this day of all days, just because it's the first time since she's left that I've been able to.

INT. BAR - LATER

Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other. We get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them.

Rob leans forward.

<ROB>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Ian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray's a disaster. I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.

<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mission accomplished.

<LAURA>

	I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure. I just... I need you, Rob. That's it. And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...

</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Laura is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, c'mon, Laura. Just say something. Lie, if you want. It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.

	Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.

Rob begins to get out of bed. She grabs his hand and pulls him back down.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Rob. If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?

</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

	Hey, great idea. What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay for you. Even though you owe me money. We have to do something with the money I earn. I need to. I deserve it. You can just think of it as winning the lottery.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fantastic. The Girlfriend Lottery.

	How? How were we the same people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>

	Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger. You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I. And I still do, and you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm not allowed to. I still do, after work. So, what? Should we just break up? Is that what you're saying? Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.

<LAURA>

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're alright. But you're certainly not happy. So what happens if you get happy? And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable? What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?

She knew I needed a kick in the ass. She also knew how happy I was when I used to deejay. From which every angle I examine it, it still looks as though she's done all of this because she loves me.

I've done it all, lived through it all in my head. I know the whole plot, the ending, and the good parts. Now I'd have to watch it all over again in real time, and where's the fun in that? And fucking--when is it all going to stop? Am I going to jump from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there aren't any rocks left? Am I going to bolt every time I get itchy feet? Because I get them about once a quarter, along with the store's tax bill. I've been thinking with my guts since I was fourteen years old and, frankly speaking, I've come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains. You know what's wrong with Laura, what my problem is? What's wrong with Laura is that I'll never see her for the first or second or third time. That's all. Fuck it. I'll probably mail the tape.

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to talk to me about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha ha ha. Hoo hoo hoo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in love, exactly, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you marry me if I was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Probably not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Okay, then. Shall we go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very persuasive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you persuadable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't think so. I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've changed my mind. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do. I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. I'm only trying to explain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you've asked.
	</DIALOGUE>

TWO TURNTABLES

with the mixer in the middle. "Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor spins on turntable #1. A hand reaches in, and begins to draw the slides down, quieting the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst the instruments. The place is packed with people, and everyone seems to be having a great time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him and mocks a bulimic act. Rob gives him the finger. He sees Laura, and she beams at him. He comes to the front of the stage, and taps a microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight. I hope you have a good time. And I hope you like the record. The one by the Kinky Wizards. The record that we're having this record release party for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hoots from the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Listen to it first, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. We'll get to that later. Right now, I'd like to introduce...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonic Death Monkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<DIRECTION>
Good-natured applause. Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura. Barry and his crew mount the stage. Rob takes a big gulp of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROB>
<DIRECTION>
(to Laura)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an idiot. I should have played the record first. This place is about to get burned down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROB>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna be fine. These people are ready for anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<BARRY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a smile. He and the band all wear suits and ties.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, Rob. We're not called Sonic Death Monkey anymore, though, ladies and gentlemen. We might be on the verge of becoming the Atavistics, but we haven't decided yet. But tonight, we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN FIVE! ONE TWO THREE --And they launch into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It Up," almost flawlessly faithful to the original. Barry is transformed -- shuffling footwork, a wide smile, and when the intro winds up, an almost perfect falsetto. The crowd goes nuts, filling the floor. Rob is stunned, begins to smile. Laura takes his hand and leads him out into the crowd...
