:SC: WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This movie starts the way all movies should... with a cartoon. It's not a Disney or a Warner's. It's not a Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz. This is a lesser known studio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A "MAROON CARTOON"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAROON CARTOONS PRESENT: BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT IN "THE BUNNYSITTER".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below are two cameos of the cartoon's stars. One picture is of a cherubic baby in a bonnet innocently posed with his thumb in his mouth. The other is of a paunchy rabbit with a gap between his front teeth. He has a loveable, if slightly shell-shocked look. The cartoon begins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BABY HERMAN AND ROGER RABBIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are in a playpen when TWO FEMALE LEGS in high heels walk INTO FRAME. The VOICE belonging to the legs talks down to Baby Herman in a maternal coo.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy's going to the beauty parlor, darling. But I'm leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger. He's going to take very, very good care of you...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice turns ominous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... cause if he doesn't, he's going back to the science lab!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Roger gulps as he watches the legs disappear. We HEAR FOOTSTEPS recede and a DOOR SLAM. Roger turns confidently back to his charge. But the little tyke is already squeezing through the playpen bars.
</DIRECTION>
<BABY_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby bye-bye...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BABY_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roger makes a dive for him, misses, and gets his head stuck between the bars. He pleads with the Baby in a voice that resonates of Huntz Hall in "The Bowery Boys".
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, come back! You heard what your mother said!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
BABY HERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ignores Roger. We FOLLOW HIM as he crawls into the kitchen. He stops to regard something that has caught his attention... a cookie jar. It's sitting on top of the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<BABY_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coo-kie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BABY_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wearing the playpen like a pillory, comes running toward the kitchen. But the playpen is too wide to clear the door. The impact SHATTERING the playpen and sends Roger sprawling across the kitchen floor. When he looks up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BABY HERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is swinging precariously on the door of the freeer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, Baby. I'll save you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Roger makes a desperate leap across the kitchen for the kid. But Baby Herman swings the door to the freezer open and Roger disappears inside. Baby Herman grabs a cookie and swings back, shutting the door. He climbs down and crawls out of the kitchen. After a beat, the freezer door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now shaped like a block of ice, falls out and hits the floor. The block SHATTERS into ice cubes. Roger looks around, dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BABY HERMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has taken this opportunity to crawl out the window. Roger races to the window. His eyes pop out of his head at what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baby Herman is crawling along the sidewalk under the shadow of a safe being hoisted into a second floor window by the Acme Safe Moving Company. The rope holding the safe is fraying down to a slender thread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gasps and rockets out the window toward Baby Herman. The rope snaps. The safe falls. Roger arrives just in time to pluck the Baby out of harm's way. But not in time to save himself. The safe CRUNCHES down on his head, burying Roger into the sidewalk. After a beat, Roger's hand appears and spins the tumbler. The safe door opens. Inside, we see the dazed rabbit with little TWEETING BIRDS circling his head.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut, cut, cut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The cartoon action stops abruptly, but the goofy CARTOON MUSIC PLAYS ON. We begin a slow PULL BACK TO REVEAL that this cartoon is being filmed LIVE ON A SOUND STAGE. The title card sits on an easle. The female legs are paper mache' props manipulated by two HUMAN CREW MEMBERS. Wearily, they lean the legs up against the stage wall. A human DIRECTOR, wearing a tweed jacket and baggy pleated pants, steps onto the set. From the equipment and the dress of the crew, we can tell it's the 1940's. Baby Herman throws his cookie down in disgust. He talks in a gravelly voice an octave lower than Wallace Beery's.
</DIRECTION>
<BABY_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell was wrong with that take??
	</DIALOGUE>
</BABY_HERMAN>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothin' with you, Baby Herman. It's on Roger... again!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(over shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Could we lose the playback?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC suddenly STOPS as, off to the side, the SOUNDMAN lifts the needle off a phonograph record. The Director leans over Roger and angrily plucks one of the birds circling his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this, Roger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
(sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A tweeting bird?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, a tweeting bird. But what does the script say? 'Rabbit gets conked. Rabbit sees stars!' Not birds, stars!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<BABY_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, for cryin' out loud, Roger! I'll be in my trailer... takin' a nap!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BABY_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Baby Herman pulls himself up to his full height of two feet and walks off the set. He chooses a route that takes him under the dress of the SCRIPT GIRL. She jumps as if goosed. Now two CREW MEMBERS lift the safe off Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about me. I can take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
CONTINUED PULLBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What we've been seeing has been from the POV of a MAN in a shiny brown suit standing unobtrusively at the back of the sound stage. Under a beat-up fedora is a craggy face that's seen a lot in its life... but apparently didn't think much of it was funny. EDDIE VALIANT takes a jolt from a pint of whiskey, evidently in reaction to what he's seen. He opens his coat and returns the pint bottle to a shoulder holster which had formerly held a .38. Nerves steadied, he walks out the stage door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAROON STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading Toon props. There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera. The license plate is California 1946. He fishes out a pack of Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been stubbed out. As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby, balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried expression coming towards him. He is R.K. MAROON, studio boss. Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starting tomorrow there'll be no more roast beef lunches. What happened to cheese sandwiches? I was raised on cheese sandwiches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And tell that guy sleepin' over there he's fired!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your wife's brother, R.K.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(reconsiders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... tell him he's promoted. But get him out of my sight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several costume designs.
</DIRECTION>
<COSTUMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your reaction, R.K.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTUMER>
<DIRECTION>
Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! That's not funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
She flips another drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny. Put a homburg on him it'll even be funnier. Huh, Valiant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the pad and shows Valiant. The rendering is of a hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that'd be a riot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, I hope what you have ain't contagious or I'll be out of business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive. I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One too many safes dropped on his head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the problem...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker. The doubt's eatin' him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you want me to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't work in Toontown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club. You can catch her in action there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So's the job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, all right... You got your hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
Maroon turns, snaps his fingers. His Assistant appears out of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen. The Assistant turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant. Suddenly Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant? It's just Dumbo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a hummingbird.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got him on loan from Disney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you the lucky one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will I hear from you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As soon as is humanly possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios". As he starts across the road he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the gates. When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG: "HA-HA-HA-HA-HA". Valiant jumps back as the roadster passes. WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face. Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(coughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn Toons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is slowing to a stop in front of the studio. It's a Pacific and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin. Valiant steps onto the "Red Car". He reaches into his pocket to give the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare. But he comes up with a handful of lint. He holds out the check.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I look like, a bank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door. Valiant suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past the rest of the boarding passengers. He walks around to the back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are loitering. When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow catcher. Valiant joins them. We HOLD as the Red Car moves away and the street urchins regard their older partner in crime with curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BILLBOARD SIGN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads: "L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's Finest Public Transportation System". PAN DOWN to see that the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal. Red Cars are going in and out of the shed. MOVE IN on one car approaching the terminal from down the street. As it passes by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long, mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant waves laconically.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the cigarettes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy bungalow. A note is push-pinned to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - NOTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It says: "Tomorrow's Friday... Well? Dolores".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes the note and walks back across the street toward the terminal. He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar on the mezzanine. The bar sports a red neon sign that used to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar". But now it just says, "Terminal".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place must have been pretty swanky at the turn of the century when it was built in the first burst of enthusiasm over the new public transportation system. It's in the motif of a trolley car. There's a large map on the wail above the bar showing all the different lines. Behind the bar is DOLORES. If you scraped off all the makeup, you'd find an attractive woman in her late thirties. She ministers to a rag-tag assortment of Hollywood low-lifes -- who are truly at the end of the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters this den, lets his eyes adjust for a moment, then bellies up to the bar. He finds a spot between a ONE-ARMED BLACK SOLDIER and a MIDGET stretched out on the bar passed out. Now a TROLLEY RUMBLES underneath them. The bar starts to shake like an earthquake, the lights flicker. All the drinkers, observing a time honored ritual, lift their glasses simultaneously to avoid spilling any drops. Even the Midget lifts his head until the trolley has passed. Valiant reaches over the bar and blind-grabs a bottle of rye he obviously knows is there. He pours himself a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, fellas, what's the good word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lost my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
An ARTHRITIC COWBOY pipes up.
</DIRECTION>
<COWBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mule died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COWBOY>
<DIRECTION>
A DEAF-MUTE scribbles a note on a pad hanging around his neck. He hands the note to Valiant. It says "My girl dumped me". Valiant pats him on the back, consoling.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know what they say about dames, Augie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Then Valiant mouths the rest of it for Augie's benefit only. Augie reads his lips, then starts to roar silently, slapping his thigh. Now Dolores makes her way down the bar. She grabs the Midget by the suspenders and slides him out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a dame who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump. And it was a dame who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And it's a dame who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant slides the check across the bar. Dolores studies it. She calms down a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this paper even good?

Now ANGELO, a Neanderthal sitting a few stools down, is tapping the shell of a hardboiled egg.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maroon? Valiant, don't tell me you're workin' for a Toon? Who's your client? Chilly Willy or Screwy Squirrel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELO>
<DIRECTION>
Angelo chuckles at his own joke and goes to eat his egg. Suddenly Valiant darkens. He grabs Angelo by the shirt and pulls him up to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get this straight, greaseball. I'm not workin' for a Toon! I'd never work for a Toon! Got that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>

Valiant jams the whole egg into Angelo's mouth, turns and storms out the door. Angelo sputters and spits out the egg.

EXT. INK & PAINT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a run-down factory area. A speakeasy style peephole slides open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA. Valiant offers the password.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walt sent me.

The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings open.

The Gorilla, dressed in a tux, gives Valiant the once over. Valiant resents the assessment.

<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW Valiant down the hall toward the main room. We can HEAR LAUGHTER and ZANY MUSIC from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Valiant steps through the doorway, we see the place is no dive. It's a white tablecloth nightclub on a par with the El Morroco or the Garden of Allah. Behind the bar A CATERPILLAR BARTENDER is using his many arms to shake and pour several drinks at once. Meanwhile a dozen PENGUIN WAITERS are gliding back and forth along the tables serving drinks to the well-heeled crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DONALD DUCK and DAFFY DUCK are seated opposite each other at matching grand pianos. What begins as a decorous Duck duet on a Tchaikovsky piece (complete with knuckle-cracking, seat-spinning preparations) quickly accelerates to a loony game of one-upsmanship between these two irascible Ducks. There is keyboard stomping, lid-banging, piano wire plucking zaniness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AUDIENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is HOWLING. People are wiping the tears from their eyes they're laughing so hard. All except...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights a cigarette impassively, not humored by the Toon hijinx. He spots an empty table off to the side and makes his way towards it. A SILLY GEEZER in a loud suit is at the next table. The Geezer nods to him soberly as Valiant pulls Out the chair and sits down. A LOUD FLATULENCE SOUND erupts from under Valiant. The Geezer slaps his thigh with the hilarity of it all.
</DIRECTION>
<GEEZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you listen to that? It's a pip! I'm thinking of callin' it a Whoopee Cushion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant reaches under himself and comes up holding a deflated rubber bladder. The Geezer retrieves it from him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No hard feelings, I hope. Put 'er there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEEZER>

The Geezer grabs Valiant's hand before he can say no. We HEAR A BUZZ. Valiant retracts his hand as if shocked. The Geezer howls with laughter and turns his palm to Eddie.

The Penguin puts a bill down on the Geezer's table and zips off. The Geezer takes a fountain pen out of his jacket and writes on the bill. But there doesn't seem to be any ink coming out. He shakes and shakes the pen to get it flowing. It flows all right. Ink splatters all over Valiant's shirt and pants. Valiant looks down at the stain, doing a slow burn. The Geezer starts laughing. Valiant jumps up and grabs him by the lapels.

ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald and Daffy's PIANO COMPETITION has reached a CRESCENDO of mayhem. They've got the axes out, and in time with the MUSIC they reduce their pianos to matchsticks. At the completion of the piece, they step to the front of the stage and with great decorum, arms around each other, they take their bows. The curtain comes down to GREAT APPLAUSE. We HEAR SFX of CRASHING AND BASHING backstage. Now from behind Valiant, we HEAR a familiar high-pitched VOICE.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DROOPY>
<DIRECTION>
There is excited APPLAUSE as the lights dim. A TOON COMBO made up of CROWS in shades STRIKES UP the intro to the smokey song, "Why Don't You Do Right". A spotlight hits the curtain. Now a curvaceous leg pokes out, teasingly. The crowd goes wild as the rest of the body belonging to the leg emerges. JESSICA RABBIT is a generously endowed red-headed bombshell. She's a humanoid Toon... in her case, more beautiful than human. Her figure is testimony to what a guy can do with a pencil and a fertile imagination,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION - VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is not quite the bunny he expected Roger to be married to. His jaw drops. And his reaction is mirrored all around the room. The men are panting so hard you couldn't keep a match lit.

</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica takes the mike and comes off the stage. Slinkily. she wanders among the tables, teasing the men as she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now there's a HOWL from behind Valiant. A Tex Avery type TOON WOLF, who came masquerading as a human, couldn't help but show his true colors at the sight of Jessica. He HOWLS as if it were a full moon. His tongue rolls out of his head and piles up on the floor like so much clothesline. His eyeballs telescope out of his head. And finally, the Wolf levitates and snaps rigid like an open jacknife. As the Wolf makes a rush for the stage, the Gorilla Bouncer grabs him by the suspenders. The Wolf, legs spinning madly, practically knocks Valiant's table over as he grabs at Jessica. But the Wolf has come to the end of his suspenders. He snaps back toward the Gorilla who is holding an anvil in front of the suspenders. CLANG! The Wolf hits the anvil and slides to the floor. The Gorilla calmly whisks him into a dustpan and carries him out.

She sashays over to the Geezer's table. Teasingly, she swirls the whisps of white hair onto his head into a Dairy Queen. He giggles gleefully and makes a grab at Jessica. But she slips out of his grasp like mercury.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'So get out of here... And get me the money toooo!'

There is RAUCOUS APPLAUSE when she finishes. Jessica looks deep into Eddie's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your lap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Before Eddie can reply, she jumps off, and slinks offstage, leaving Eddie a pile of human wreckage. Valiant slugs the rest of his drink down to put out the fire in his libido.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the lights come up, Valiant looks over to where Acme is slicking down his eyebrows and patting his hair down. He stands, picks up a bouquet of roses from the chair beside him, and as he passes Valiant's table, gives him a big wink. Valiant watches Acme disappear backstage. He stands, drops a couple bucks on the table, and follows after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant steps past the curtain, keeping a discreet distance. He follows Marvin Acme down a corridor and around the corner. Acme stops and knocks on a dressing room door. After a moment, it opens and Acme goes inside. Valiant checks over his shoulder, but the backstage area is empty. He eases over to the door and puts his eye to the keyhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH KEYHOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica is seated at her dressing table. Acme is on his knees next to her, kissing his way up her gloved hand, eyes closed in ecstasy. Jessica takes her hand out of the glove and starts combing her hair, leaving Marvin kissing a suspended Toon glove.

The Gorilla slams the door. Valiant picks himself up out of the garbage. He brushes himself off, then starts down the alley toward the rear of the building. We FOLLOW him around the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room window. He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows. He stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.

It's a large art deco office with walls covered with photos of Maroon and various celebrities, human and Toon. R.K. Maroon is seated behind his desk. Standing nearby is Valiant. They are both regarding a hysterical Roger Rabbit, who's holding a set of 8 x lO glossies. He's WAILING and CRYING, Toon tears flooding off him in a torrent.

CLOSE - ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The booze is taking its effect. There's a RUMBLE like a volcano about to erupt. Suddenly Roger's head turns into a Toon steam whistle SHRIEKING. The HIGH PITCH causes glass objects in the room to SHATTER... including the crystal decanter that Valiant's holding in his hand. It EXPLODES, soaking his suit with booze. Valiant looks down at the damage, completely exasperated.

INT. VALIANT'S BUNGALOW - CLOSE - EMPTY BOOZE BOTTLE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bottle's on the floor next to the couch Valiant's passed out on. He's still dressed in his clothes. PAN the small studio apartment. In the kitchen/alcove, Valiant has created a makeshift darkroom. We see a curtain on a clothesline. Various trays, and some pictures clipped up on clothespins. The pictures depict Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme in various states of pattycake. Now there is LOUD POUNDING on the door. But it doesn't break through VaLiant's subconscious for several seconds. Finally, he rouses, gets up and walks a crooked line to the door. Valiant opens it and squints into the excruciating sunlight. When his eyes focus, REVEAL a hang-dog POLICE DETECTIVE holding Eddie's morning paper.

An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory and pulls up in front of the old factory building. There's all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a Coroner's truck, etcetera.

Valiant and Santino get out of the police car. Santino starts into the factory. But he realizes Valiant's not following him. He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall behind the factory, transfixed.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a large warehouse filled with stacks of Toon gags,.. boxes of dynamite, giant slingshots, boulders, everything you've ever seen in a Roadrunner cartoon. Santino stops where a large black safe is imbedded at a cockeyed angle in the floor. A FORENSIC TEAM is at work around the safe. They're chalking the outline around a body half obscured by the safe.
</DIRECTION>
<LT_SANTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.

</LT_SANTINO>
<DIRECTION>
Santino walks to Acme's glassed office where a sobbing Jessica Rabbit is being interrogated. We can only see her, not the person doing the interrogating. Valiant sidles over to where the Forensic Guys are dusting the photographs he had taken for prints. One of the Forensic Guys looks up from his work.
</DIRECTION>
<FORENSIC_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORENSIC_1>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant ignores the slings and arrows and surveys the scene of the crime. The door of the safe is ajar. Valiant tries to look inside. Forensic #2 closes the door with his knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we HEAR the VOICE of Jessica Rabbit from behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Valiant?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you're proud of yourself.

She turns on her heel and storms off, sobbing into a handkerchief. Valiant, rubbing his jaw, looks after her. So do the Forensic Guys.
</DIRECTION>
<FORENSIC_1>

<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not blood, it's paint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the end of a cane comes down on Valiant's hand, pinning it to the floor. Valiant follows the cane UP to it's gavel-shaped head -- past black pants, a black robe, to a cadaver-like complected face, and a large hooked proboscis. The head is shaved. Rimless tinted glasses obscure the eyes. Although he's human, the total appearance is frighteningly vulture-like. JUDGE DOOM is accompanied by Santino.

</VALIANT>
<DOOM>

Doom smiles thinly at Valiant, tarns and walks with purpose towards the door. Santino and Valiant follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rabbit's movements are fairly clear after leaving the Maroon Studios. He ran across the street, jimmied this door open, hoisted the safe on a block and tackle...

Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.

<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... then stood out here waiting for his prey. After he cold-bloodedly accomplished his task, he went home. He was almost apprehended there by my men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la Disney's "Wind In The Willows"). They're loitering by a dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side, cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing Toon revolvers.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men? They look more like weasles to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.
	</DIALOGUE>

(turns back to Valiant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?

</DOOM>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you tried Walla Walla? Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Doom steps into Valiant's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm surprised you aren't more cooperative, Mr. Valiant. A human has been murdered by a Toon. Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that? My goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to rein in the insanity. To bring a semblance of law and order to a place where no civilized person has ever been able to step foot. The only way to do that is to make the Toons respect the law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from the Toontown side. He's holding his blackened rear end... apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite. BONK! The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending them both sprawling. The Gopher picks himself up and shakes off the effects of the concusion. When he sees who he's knocked down, he panics.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
(petrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judge Doom! Here, let me get that for ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously tries to clean the Judge's cloak. Doom picks up the Gopher by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've soiled my robe!

<DIRECTION>
When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back. In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid. A Weasle turns a key and the flow of liquid stops. The Gopher starts kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme go. I think I hear my mother callin' me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash for the wall. Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where his car is parked. It's a black Lincoln touring car with an ugly bird-like hood ornament.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Voltaire... the Gopher!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life. It's a hideous TOON VULTURE. The Vulture flaps into flight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him airborne. The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles. They pin him down.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't I have any rights?

</GOPHER>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy trial.

One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts it on the hood and snaps it open. Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop up, arranged in a jury box.

The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E G-U-I-L-T-Y.

As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee. They fill it from a spigot on the truck.

	What's with the dip?

<DIRECTION>
THE GOPHER
</DIRECTION>

is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up and holds him over the tub. Then, as he's lowered into the solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are snuffed MID-YELP.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Help! He...

The Gopher's gone. All that's left of him is a paint slick on the surface of the liquid.

Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and hands them to a Weasle. He turns to Valiant.

<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant. but that's how we handle things in Toontown. I would think you'd appreciate that.

INT. TERMINAL BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dolores is behind the bar cutting lemon peels and preparing for the day's bartending. There's one early customer, a grey-haired TROLLEYMAN in his Red Car uniform. His hat's on the stool next to him and he's already drunk. The door opens. It's Valiant. He walks over to the bar, reaches for a bottle and a shot glass and helps himself. Dolores picks up a copy of the morning paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>

	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you? I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?

<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where is it then?

INT. VALIANT'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie comes in the door with his coat over his shoulder. He tosses the jacket over the chair and walks to the Murphy bed. He grabs the strap, and loosening his tie, walks away from the wall, pulling the bed down. What he doesn't see is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER RABBIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
asleep in the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still with his back to Roger, sits down exhaustedly on the bed and kicks off his shoes. He lies back and pulls the covers over him. He closes his eyes, rolls over to get comfortable. Now he and Roger are nose-to-nose. They both open their eyes at the same time. They freak.

	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner. He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.
	</DIALOGUE>

<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!

Eddie tries to open the door, but Roger blocks it spider-like, arms and legs extended.

	Please, Eddie, don't put me out. I didn't do it, I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant gives up trying to open the door and grabs Roger. He pulls and he pulls. Finally Roger snaps off like a broken rubber band. The two of them go tumbling backward. Valiant makes a grab for Roger but he slips out of his grasp like quicksilver.

Valiant picks himself up and tries to catch his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was on stage, so I found a piece of paper and wrote her a love letter.

Roger pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and starts reading.

<ROGER_RABBIT>

(continuing)

	'Dear Jessy. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 1-1000, 2-1000, 3-1000...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant leaps for Roger and gets bim by the throat. He rips the paper out of Roger's hand and crumples it up and throws it down. He opens the door, throws Roger outside and quickly slams the door shut. He leans against it, breathing hard. Suddenly, Roger comes through the mail slot like a limbo dancer. Valiant, too tired to chase him, just watches him.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, that wasn't very nice.

<ROGER_RABBIT>

	It took me almost an hour to compose that. But I decided not to leave it anyway. I'd read it in person, that was my plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant crosses to the kitchen area where the dark room is still set up. He opens the cabinet under the sink and comes out with a bottle of Scotch. He takes a shot glass and pours himself one.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.

</VALIANT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>

	Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

</VALIANT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>

Valiant shoots the drink down and holds up the empty glass.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the phone on the counter. He lifts the receiver and starts to dial.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is the moment of truth! And I've spoken the truth, but you won't believe the truth. So I guess the truth is my goose is cooked, my hash is slung. my fait is accompli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>

As Valiant finishes dialing, he idly puts the empty shot glass down on a photograph on the counter.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won't anything change your mind?

Valiant turns from the pleading rabbit. Now something he sees on the counter gets his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH SHOT GLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shot glass is resting on one of the reject pictures of Acme and Jessica. The bottom of the glass is magnifying the back of the exuberant Marvin Acme. Sticking out of his back pocket is a legal folder headed "Last Will and Testament".
</DIRECTION>

<ROGER_RABBIT>

</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Now outside we HEAR TIRES SCREECHING to a stop. Roger runs to the window and pulls back the drapes. His eyes bug out of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Toon Control!

Valiant comes to the window and looks out, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT'S POV

<DIRECTION>
The Toon Control wagon has stopped in front of the house. The Weasles pile out. One of them takes what looks like a butterfly net out of the back. Several others grab violin cases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE AND ROGER

Valiant jerks Roger back behind the curtain.

	Not in there. That's the first place they'll look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant goes to the closet and opens the door. REVEAL Roger is now dressed in Eddie's trenchcoat and hat. Playfully, Roger snaps one of the handcuffs onto Eddie's wrist. He's got the Other attached to one of his wrists.

EXT. VALIANT'S DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns and shoulder them in teams of two. Suddenly they unleash a torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle in the door with BULLETS. The leader blows on the cut-out and it falls in. The Weasles file through one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasles don't bother to look around. They all just start BLASTING. Bullets fly every which way. The barrage destroys Valiant's apartment in a matter of seconds. When the shooting stops and the smoke clears, the Weasles look around. The head Weasle spots blood all over the kitchen floor.
</DIRECTION>
<WEASLE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got him.

But when he looks behind the counter, it's only a shattered ketchup bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR OF APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the alley. Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster. He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur. Valiant stumbles trying to keep up. When they round the corner, Roger slams on the brakes, Toon style. Valiant goes skidding past him and is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>

	Hey! What do you think you're doin'?

EXT. STREET - EDDIE AND ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerge from the alley. They pause momentarily to reconnoiter. Eddie decides to go left, Roger right. When they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile. Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way, goof...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
They start across the street. But Roger goes on one side of the Street sign, Eddie the other. Roger coils around it like a tether ball. Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WEASLES

The CONDUCTOR raises his hands like it was a hold-up. A couple PASSENGERS scream as the Weasles search the car. But no Roger or Eddie. As quickly as they got on, they get off.

We FOLLOW Dolores as she leads Valiant and Roger across the hall. She stops at a door, unlocks it, and leads them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a tiny storage room/office with an institutional metal desk, a cot, and assorted janitorial supplies stacked around. Dolores shuts and locks the door behind her. Valiant goes to a metal locker and digs through some tools, coming out with a hacksaw. He sits on the cot and starts working on the cuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you decided to help him after all?

Roger quiets like a child for a moment as Valiant saws feverishly. Then Roger slips his hand out of the cuff and holds his side while Eddie keeps sawing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant saws a couple more strokes before the realization of what Roger's done hits him. His face darkens. Roger sees the look and sheepishly tries to recover by sticking his hand back in the cuff.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no, not any time. Only when it was funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>

Valiant looks at Roger like he's about to brain him. Roger pulls his hand free again, and cowers out of range. Valiant just rubs his forehead.

<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.

	So that's what this little drama is all about.

	Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.

	I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent.

	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.

</VALIANT>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the scam, Eddie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The habeus corpus is thickening.

<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DOLORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe? You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he's not forty feet tall. The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Dolores whistles over his deductions.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>

<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

Valiant finishes sawing the cuffs. He stands and throws the cuffs aside. Valiant and Dolores go to the door. Roger follows them eagerly.

A MAITRE D' is leading Valiant and Augie, the deaf-mute to a table by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll be fine, huh, Augie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Augie nods his head. They sit and pick up the menus. Augie takes one peek and looks at Valiant, alarmed. He scribbles a note. Valiant reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about the prices, pal. If you want the shrimp cocktail, you have a shrimp cocktail.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Augie, I've got a little table-hopping to do.

Valiant gets up from the table and starts across the room.

Now Valiant arrives, pulls up a chair from next table and sits down.

	Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?

<MAROON>

<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've already seen your photographs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAROON>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I enlarged this one. Thought you might be interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant takes an enlargement of the pattycake shot and puts it on the table in front of Maroon. We can clearly see the will sticking out of Acme's pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway... enjoy your lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant stands and departs. But his visit has done it's trick. Maroon looks l'ike he's seen a ghost. We FOLLOW Valiant across the room to his table where Augie is blissfully attacking a shrimp cocktail.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is that, Augie, pretty good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Augie nods enthusiastically. Valiant keeps an eye on Maroon's booth. Now he nudges Augie as Maroon excuses himself and goes into the phone booth just outside the door. Augie puts his shrimp fork down and picks up his pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUGIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Maroon talk on the phone MOS. As his lips move, Valiant supplies his words.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>

	Somebody's gonna have to take care of him.

	The old man had it at the club that night. That's right. Yeah, I'm sure. I'll be there.

(continuing; to Augie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Augie shrugs his shoulders. Disappointed, Valiant lights a cigarette. Now Augie elbows him and gestures across at Maroon, who's making another call. Augie starts writing again.

(continuing; reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Iris... cancel my appointments this afternoon. I'll be at Forest Lawn.

A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane. Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress. Clustered around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe. There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE. TOM AND JERRY. HECKLE AND JECKLE. CHIP 'N DALE. Everyone from the famous to the not so famous is in attendance. The eulogy is being delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE. It's FOGHORN LEGHORN.
</DIRECTION>
<FOGHORN_LEGHORN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE GRAVESITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced human in a black mourning coat. The Director starts to turn the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<FOGHORN_LEGHORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us a sign, brother Herman, that you've arrived...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOGHORN_LEGHORN>
<DIRECTION>
Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE". Now the Toon mourners pick up on it and join in.
</DIRECTION>
<TOONS>

</TOONS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out. The funeral Director faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER. The Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a funeral befitting a gag king. They climb into their cars and SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500. One mourner is left at the gravesite. Sitting in a chair dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit. Maroon walks up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAROON>
	<DIALOGUE>

Valiant turns to see a GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass. Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and Jessica having an arguement. There's accusatory finger pointing. In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as if describing the position of Acme's will.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica tries to leave. He grabs her arm. They're screaming at each other but we don't hear a word. Valiant waves frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine. But the Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves back. Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster. She jumps in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car. The Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant. He SHUTS OFF THE ENGINE. The cemetery is completely still again.

The Gorilla opens it and they muscle the piano inside. After a moment, they reemerge. We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second baby grand stands ready to be moved.

is lying prone -- using the Steinway as his own Trojan Horse. He lifts the piano lid to climb out, but then HEARS FOOTSTEPS approaching. He lowers the lid again. Now someone starts testing the keys. We see the hammers strike the strings, RUNNING UP THE SCALES until they reach the one under Valiant's nose. The hammer whacks Valiant's nose on the backswing and strikes the string making a terrible SOUR NOTE.

as the VOICES of Daffy and Donald recede, Valiant raises the lid and quickly climbs out. He eases over to Jessica's dressing room. As he starts to open the door, he HEARS SCUFFLING from inside. Valiant puts his ear to the door. More SCUFFLING. Valiant straightens, then suddenly whips the door open and flicks on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody's there. Perplexed, Valiant closes the door behind him and checks behind the dressing screen. In the closet. No one. He shrugs and starts to search the room. He goes to Jessica's dressing table and rifles the drawers. In her purse he discovers a Toon revolver. He examines it.

Valiant puts the gun back in the purse and closes the drawer. As he stands, he pauses to consider a Hurrel-like black-and-white photo of Roger Rabbit in a silver deco frame. He's dramatically posed with a cigarette like he was Tyrone Power.

Valiant shakes his head and turns from the table. Something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FLOOR
</DIRECTION>

Behind the dressing table, the corner of a piece of blue paper peeks out. Valiant stoops down and fishes it out. It's a cover for a legal document -- "Last Will and Testament -- Marvin Acme".

</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
We can't see anything in the darkness. But we hear the SOUND of A FISTFIGHT. There's the CRASHING of lamps and furniture breaking. Now the door opens for a second as the assailant escapes. Light floods in the room, illuminating Valiant on the floor with a curtain wrapped around his head. As he struggles free the door closes. The room is dark again. Valiant scrambles to the door. When he whips it open, REVEAL the Gorilla framed in the doorway. Valiant is frozen. The Gorilla flicks on the light. He smiles wickedly.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel. He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist. Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and brushes. They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the road. The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside. Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath. Then he struggles to free his hands. Finally he rips the sack off his head and sits up.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE - VALIANT

We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted over his head. Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a costume that won't come off. Valiant curses, gets to his feet and stumbles down the road.

Valiant tries to pull the brim of his hat down. But it's comically small on the huge head. He makes his way down the aisle past a veritable gauntlet of RAZZING, poking, tripping PASSENGERS. Finally he finds an empty seat in the back as the Red Car starts up.

All the regulars in the bar have a good laugh at that one. Now as Roger twirls around on the post, he smashes into a bar tray held by Eddie.

VALIANT'S POW - THROUGH DOOR - JUDGE DOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has entered the bar. He stands FRAMED in the doorway, Voltaire perched on his shoulder. The red light of the neon sign flashes on his glasses making him look like he's got burning coals for eyes. With the Weasles at the door backing him up, the satanic Doom walks to the bar, his FOOTSTEPS CREAKING along the wooden floor. He surveys the scene, leans over the bar for a glass. Doom holds the glass up to the light and looks at it disgustedly. He picks up a bottle of scotch and carries it down to where the one-armed Soldier is sitting. Doom stares at him, then pulls the empty sleeve out of the amputee's pocket. He uses it to wipe the inside of the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>

	I'm looking for a rabbit. He was last seen in this neighborhood.

<DIRECTION>
Doom walks around Dolores toward the back. But Doom stops next to the blackboard. On it is written: "Today's Special - French Dip - $ .50". Doom erases the "French" and the decimal point in front of the "50". Then he picks up the chalk and starts to write. The CHALK SQUEAKS excruciatingly on the blackboard. Everyone winces but watches anyway, as Doom writes "Rabbit" where the "French" was, and adds the zeroes to the "50". It now reads: "Rabbit Dip - $5000".

Doom stares down the regulars until the laughter stops. Meanwhile, a Weasle has started sniffing around the bar where Roger was dancing. As Doom turns to leave, the Weasle whispers in his ear as he points to the back. Doom smiles and pats the Weasle on the head. He turns to Angelo and the others.

He streaks across the bar and out the front door. After a beat, two Weasles step into the bar holding the butterfly net they had stretched across the door. They WHEEZE with glee at the struggling Roger trapped inside. A third Weasle carries the Judge's briefcase.

Doom strides confidently into the bar.

Valiant and Dolores are led out by a couple Weasles holding guns on them. As Doom snaps the briefcase open on the bar, the twelve Kangaroos pop up in their jury box. Doom raps on the bar with his gavel-headed cane. The regulars watch the bizarre scene in stunned silence.

He grabs Roger's hand and forces the drink into it. Roger shrugs his shoulders and shoots the drink down. We've seen the reaction before. Suddenly Roger's head turns into a STEAM WHISTLE emitting such a PIERCING BLAST that is sends everyone into ear-grabbing agony. Glasses, bottles, mirrors, even Doom's glasses SHATTER. Valiant uses the distraction to punch the Weasles holding Roger. He grabs the rabbit by the scruff of the neck. He gets as assist from Augie, who couldn't hear the noise. Unfazed, Augie whacks a Weasle on the head with a barstool. The Midget crawls behind Doom, who's been momentarily blinded. The one-armed Soldier pushes him over. Angelo is turning one Weasle's head around and around like a cruller. Finally, Doom gets to his feet.

A hand painted design on the rippled glass shows a knight on a white charger. On the shield in bold letters it says, "Veritas". And lettered around it -- "Valiant and Valiant - Private Investigation".

VALIANT

<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a typical detective office -- a couch, a sink, a window -- except for the partner's desk in the middle of the room. There's a chair on each side. Valiant closes the door and locks it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>

Valiant stretches out on the couch. Roger nudges him to move over so he can lie down. Grudgingly, Valiant slides over a fraction giving Roger a tiny piece of the couch. They lie head to foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The problems of the day are knitting his brow. Finally his eyes close. After a beat, we HEAR Roger SNORING. It's LOUD. Valiant's eyes pop open. He rolls over. WIDEN THE SHOT to see what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE ROGER'S HEAD - A TOON DREAM BUBBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has appeared. Inside the bubble is a saw sawing back and forth through a log. It is SYNCHRONIZED to the SOUND of Roger's SNORE. Valiant kicks Roger, trying to stop the infernal SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
In the dream bubble, the saw cuts through the log. One end of the log falls out of the bubble and BONKS Roger on the head, knocking him unconscious. Valiant shakes his head and closes his eyes again. We PAN UP off his face and PAST the window where the sun is setting. As the CAMERA MOVES ALONG THE WALL, we see a gallery of framed newspaper clippings. "Valiant and Valiant Crack Popeye Kidnapping - Return Sweepea to Loving Arms of Parents". And... "Brothers Find Brothers: Heckle and Jeckle Rescued From Redwood Forest!" And... "Goofy Cleared of Atomic Spying Charges". The PAN CONTINUES until we get to the window again. Now it's dark outside. MOVE DOWN to Valiant's sleeping face. He stirs. then opens one eye. Now they both pop open at what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roger has a magnifying glass an inch in front of his face that distorts his grinning face hideously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT

startled from his sleep, reflexively shoves Roger away from him. He flies into a swivel chair and goes spinning around.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take him in. But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.

Maroon switches on the lights. He goes to his desk. He takes out the gun and puts it in the left hand drawer. Then he takes it out and puts it in the right hand drawer.

Valiant gets out of the car. He looks down the tunnel. He's sweating. He loosens his necktie. He paces back and forth at the tunnel mouth. He looks up at the Toontown sign and suddenly smashes it with his fist. It spins around like a weathervane.
</DIRECTION>

Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose. He grabs the black bag and puts it on the hood. He opens it and takes out the wooden box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - BOX

VALIANT

THE TOON BULLET

VALIANT'S FOV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown, where it's a beautiful sunny day. Eddie is now driving down a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world. It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood. The trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC. Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood ornament on the front of a TOON CAR. Then as the car starts to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember from the Ink & Paint Club. He's in top hat and tails, a TOON LAMB in the passenger seat. He tips his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helloooo, cousin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
Now he drives past a Toon building under construction. Like everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports the name "Acme". The sign out frontsays: WATCH OUR PROGRESS. Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in about two seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks. Then suddenly cars pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard like arteriosclerosis. There is mad HONKING in this cartoon traffic jam. Eddie shakes his head. He pulls over, parks and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant pulls out his Toon .38. Suddenly, the street empties in the blink of an eye. Shutters close, and the sidewalk rolls up like window shades. It's so quiet you could hear a pin drop. In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window, landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover. All is quiet again. Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK behind him. Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at the sound.

stops at a street sign. The post is bristling with fingers pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie, Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down of course), and finally a finger which says: The Dame. Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise building.
</DIRECTION>

He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators. Valiant hustles inside after her.

Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a BING at the 125th floor. The elevator doors open and Valiant steps on.

IN THE ELEVATOR

Valiant punches 125. Suddenly the elevator takes out with such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor. After a moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling. Then bounces back to the floor as the doors open. He picks himself up and steps off the elevator.

Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a flagpole for dear life. He looks down at the street which looks miles below. Valiant inches back along the flagpole to the door and pulls himself to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tries the next door. This time more carefully. A SPEEDING TRAIN is coming right at him. He slams the door. He tries the next one. A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub. She lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM. Valiant closes that door quickly, and turns to the last. When he opens this one, we HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC. We see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn. There's a NOISE behind the garbage cans. Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at Valiant's feet. A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess they didn't clean up after the last moider.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull picking his teeth. Valiant kicks the skull. The rat scrambles for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Valiant continues on, we see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JESSICA RABBIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his back.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move, Valiant.

Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with her revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I always figured I'd get it in Toontown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! She fires. But Valiant's still standing. We HEAR a CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a fire escape above.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I got him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>

Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure. He follows, bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shot Roger.

</VALIANT>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not Roger. It's one of Doom's men. He killed R.K. Maroon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears. The rabbit head pops off. Underneath is a Weasle. In his hand is the Colt .45 Buntline.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>

	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.

As they run down the alley...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
THE PACKARD - ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm... What would be the harm if I took her for a spin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
He throws it into gear. The Packard bucks into the car in front of it. Then Roger shifts again. The same process is repeated in reverse. He SMASHES back and forth. BANG! BANG!

<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PACKARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is careening down Toon streets totally out of control. Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a motorboat. He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and out the other, diapers all over the windshield. Unable to see, Roger steers right off the road. The car hurtles through space. As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon Monument Valley. The Packard passes a promontory on which WILE E. COYOTE is perched. As Roger passes, he waves to the Coyote.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Roger Rabbit. Love your work.

<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE AND JESSICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles. They unleash a fusilade of bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground. The bullets pass harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese Shop, riddling a round of cheese. The CHEESEMAKER'S hand comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to "Swiss".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special. The Toon Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten pins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend on them. They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden fence. Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose cones. Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get onto Doom?

	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun. BLAM! Valiant fires at him. The Weasle ducks back around the corner. But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and goes around the corner, too. We HEAR an EXPLOSION. The Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>

	A joker to the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction. Valiant aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way. But when he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

</VALIANT>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He made me laugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant shakes his head. Now they are completely surrounded by Weasles. The situation looks bleak.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do you prefer to die this way or that way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him. Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need a lift?

Valiant does a take.

<DIRECTION>
The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast improvement in the company you keep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROADSTER>
<DIRECTION>
Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles. They swing back and forth like tavern doors, then topple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon Arctic. His tires turn into skis. He slaloms back and forth between trees. The Weasles pursue on dogsled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and slides down it. They land in the Toon Sahara. Benny crawls up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator. He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels, waving scimitars. When they reach the top of the sand dune, we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROADSTER>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see any bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<ROADSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because you gotta draw it first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROADSTER>
<DIRECTION>
Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw Bridge". He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a bridge. It's a rickety rope bridge. Using the pencil as a balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the bridge after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the pencil from him and gets out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at him, swords raised. With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the eraser end of the pencil. This freezes the Weasles. But as Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off the pencil and falls down into the chasm. The Weasles WHEEZE with relief and advance for the kill. At the last second, Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a handsaw. He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope. The bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite canyon wall. One by one, they slide off and disappear into the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbs back into Benny. The Roadster takes off again, making a skidding left turn onto the main drag. As they make their break into the Toontown tunnel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOONTOWN TUNNEL - L.A. SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under the Toontown sign. From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of Benny's ENGINE coming closer. Now a foot comes out of the shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum. As the SOUND of the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over, spilling a clear liquid across the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
belongs to Judge Doom. Doom smiles sadistically as the Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of the tunnel. When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh... whoaaa...! Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROADSTER>
<DIRECTION>
His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick. Without tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the bushes roadside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you two all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out. Valiant climbs out after her. The Weasles quickly relieve him of his Toon pistol.

The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln. A Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.
</DIRECTION>
<WEASLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEASLE>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not going anywhere. We'll send the mobile unit after him.

Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping onto the running boards.

<ROADSTER>

He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his tootsies one by one. There's a HISS as they hit the water and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah... that's better.
	</DIALOGUE>

Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of the Toontown Tunnel. He ducks down and peeks over the ditch to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER IN THE PACKARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards. Maroon's Packard looks like the winner of a demolition derby.

<DIRECTION>
Benny stands and waves to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger!

<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benny?

Benny hobbles over to the Packard. He pops his trunk and rummages around. He comes out with Toon boltcutters. He clips Roger's cuffs off.
</DIRECTION>

Doom's car is parked inside. There are several other vehicles as well. There's a steamroller, a road grader, and a huge modified tanker truck. It's mounted with a thousand gallon vat, the contents of which are being stirred by a motorized unit. All the vehicles are marked with a large green four-leaf clover logo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT AND JESSICA

<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frisk them. See if they have the will.

</DOOM>

Several Weasles rush for the opportunity to frisk Jessica. The head Weasle slaps the others away. Then WHEEZING laciviously, he turns to the task. He starts to move his hands over her body when Jessica stomps her heel on his feet.

AT THE BRICK WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jackhammering has stopped. A Weasle plucks one brick out of the wall. Toon light beams through. He reaches into the hole in the wall and comes out holding a bunch of Toon bananas. WHEEZING wickedly, he passes them out to his compatriots. They devour the bananas, throwing the peels helter-skelter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Milking the moment, he shifts the gun from one hand to another. He circles Doom, poking and prodding him with the gun.

POV OVERHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We LOOK DOWN on the proceedings from high in the rafters. PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're watching from the POV of Voltaire, who's perched on the top inventory rack. Voltaire cleans his fingernails, casually.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, justice, Judge Doom. The real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Voltaire calmly nudges an Acme Ton-Of-Bricks off the shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He never sees it coming. SMASH! The bricks land on his head and bury him. The only thing we can see of Roger is his hand with the gun in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is turning out better than I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Doom picks the gun up. The Weasles drag Roger out from under the bricks. Big bright stars are circling his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
(delirious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, stars! Ready when you are, Raoul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant shakes his head, but Jessica starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have missed you, Roger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tie the lovebirds together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasles twirl Toon rope around Roger and Jessica like a cocoon. They hook them on a power winch. Then hit a button and raise Roger and Jessica until they're suspended fifteen feet above the floor... right in the path of the Dipmobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom hands Valiant's gun to the head Weasle.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped... then shoot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Doom turns and starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps on a Toon banana peel and goes flat on his keester.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WEASLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
always quick with a laugh, BREAK UP at their boss' misfortune. The one guarding Eddie is so overcome with LAUGHTER that he's slapping his thigh with his gun hand. Valiant sees his opportunity. He starts to make a move toward the distracted Weasle and almost gets his hands on the gun when:
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out, you idiot... he's going for the gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasle turns at the last second, sticking the barrel up against Valiant's nose. Doom gets to his feet. He glowers at the Weasle and knocks him on the head with the gavel head of his cane. Doom stalks out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasles scramble to positions on the Dipmobile. One FIRES UP the ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streetcleaner brushes start to turn. The vehicle starts to creep forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Weasle climbs into the turret. He puts Roger and Jessica in the crosshairs of the cannon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beads of sweat break out on Valiant's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasle, WHEEZING with evil glee, starts to press his finger to the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys think this is real funny, doncha?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Valiant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, do somethin'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
At the last second, Eddie shouts at the Weasle.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasle turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before you pull the trigger, I want you to know somethin' about the guy you're about to dip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Eddie breaks into the "Looney Tooney Song". The song Roger had sung in the bar. The silly voice that comes out of his mouth surprises everybody, especially Roger.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'His name is Roger Rabbit He's got a crazy habit...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant starts skulking across the floor. It's a cross between Groucho Marx and a Chuck Berry Duck Walk.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'He likes to sing and dance and yuk So brighten up and smile you schmuck...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant starts "hoo-hooing", slapping himself in the forehead. Now the Weasles start GIGGLING. They've never seen a human do this before.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Now my name's Eddie V I'm looney too you'll see'
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant flips into a handstand and starts walking on his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I walk with my hands And I shake with my feet...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
He offers his foot to a Weasle who shakes it. The others HOWL. Eddie flips upright and grabs a stick of Acme dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I think dynamite Is swell to eat'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie takes a bite out of the Toon dynamite and acts like he's savoring it. The spectacle of this human doing this is too much to bear. Now the Weasles are rolling on the ground, holding their sides.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's lost his mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, isn't it great? Keep it up, Eddie... you're killing 'em, you're slayin' 'em, you're knockin' 'em dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Roger means it. The Weasles are laughing so hard they're giving themselves heart attacks. Valiant spins around on the floor like a clock dial gone berserk.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, the Weasles keel over... dead. Opaque WEASLE SPIRITS leave their bodies with wings and harps, and float heavenward, still laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOLTAIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
alarmed at the scene below, grabs a brick and flaps toward the ceiling. He throws the brick through the skylight and flies out.
</DIRECTION>
<VOLTAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doom! Doom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOLTAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DIPMOBILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weasle on the turret collapses onto the trigger. The unmanned dip cannon starts spraying, as the arm sweeps slowly back and forth like an, automatic lawn sprinkler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hitches a ride on the last ascending Weasle Spirit, letting it hoist him to the top of the truck. As he moves the Weasle body off the trigger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOLTAIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASHES back through the skylight and swoops down on Eddie. He sinks his talons into Eddie's back and lifts him into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Valiant is being pulled skyward he reaches for something along the wall of inventory. He grabs a handful of Acme Small Pills and jams a couple dowm the buzzard's mouth. Instantly, Voltaire starts to shrink. As he gets smaller, he can no longer hold Eddie up. They both descend as Voltaire shrinks to the size of a chick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sprayer is swinging back towards Roger and Jessica. At the last second, Valiant reaches up and blocks it. It swings back the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Valiant scrambles up on the vehicle to turn it off, Voltaire has found a box of Acme Big Pills. He pecks into it... and after a beat, EXPLODES out of the box. He's now three times the size he was before. Voltaire flaps in for the kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant reaches the turret just in time to swing the cannon around. The spray of dip blasts one of Voltaire's wings off. He spins earthward like a flaming Messerschmidt, finally landing in the dip vat and dissolving into a black pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom arrives just in time to see his pet bird dissolved. Angrily, he steps onto a giant Acme Mousetrap. He uses a piece of Acme cheese to spring it, catapulting him through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Valiant is about to turn off the dip cannon, Doom lands on the truck. He knocks Eddie off the turret with a flying tackle. They both hit the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom gets up, leaving Eddie stunned. He sprints to where the Weasle had dropped Eddie's pistol. Finally Eddie shakes it off. He sees Doom about to reach the gun. He straps on a pair of Acme Rocket Skates, fires them up and shoots across the floor. He knocks Doom into a stack of Acme boxes, toppling the whole shelf down on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sprayer swings back toward Roger and Jessica, they have their last moment together.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger, I want you to know I love you. I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be comforted in the knowledge that as we face the Grim Dipper, our paint will be comingled for eternity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
They both close their eyes, waiting for the end. But it never cames. The truck runs up on some boxes and the sprayer arm swings back the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom grabs an Acme slingshot, loads an Acme boulder and fires it at Valiant. BLAM! It whacks Valiant on the head, laying him out cold in front of the Cloverleaf steamroller,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doom climbs into the steamroller and starts it up. He puts it into gear and starts it rolling toward Valiant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant comes around to see the huge roller bearing down on him. At the last second, Valiant rolls out of the way and grabs an Acme boxing glove. It accordians out and smashes Doom in the face. He goes flying out of the driver's seat, turning the wheel as he falls. The steamroller starts to turn in circles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant jumps Doom. But Doom is stronger. He throws Valiant off and starts whacking him with his fist. He pummels Valiant backward toward the drum of the steamroller. Valiant grabs the nearest thing for defense. It's a can of Acme Stay-Put Adhesive. He whips it up in front of his face. Doom puts his fist right through it, covering his hand with glue. He smiles at Valiant and hauls off again. Valiant ducks. Doom's fist strikes the top of the drum of the steamroller. Frantically he tries to pull it off. But it "Stays-Put". The roller starts to suck his fist down and under.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica and Roger avert their eyes as the steamroller crushes Doom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant breathes a sigh of relief. He starts for the dip truck as the cannon swings back toward Roger and Jessica. But neither of them are watching the cannon. Their eyes are fixed on the ground behind the steamroller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There isn't the messy pile of blood and guts you'd expect to see if a human got run over. Instead, we see that Judge Doom's remains have rolled out like a flat black pancake. After a beat, an edge curls up with a CREAK. Now the whole shape peels off the floor and wobbles to it's feet. REVEALING DOOM IS A TOON.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns to see Doom stick his flattened thumb in his mouth. He blows, re-inflating himself. His glasses CRACK and fall off. Then his prosthetic eyeballs pop out. His teeth shatter and fall out of his mouth like china. Underneath his latex mask we can see his Toon mouth and evil red Toon eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprised?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
Doom takes the black rubber gloves off, REVEALING red hands with long fingernails. He makes his fist into an anvil and advances on Valiant.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so? Well, we'll see who's the goofy one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! From ten feet away, he smashes Valiant with a bone-crushing punch. Valiant staggers backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, when I killed your brother, Teddy, I used to talk just like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
Doom spesks in a Toony high-pitched squeak. Valiant recognizes him now.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! Doom hammers Valiant again. He's defenseless against Doom's super human strength. BLAM! Valiant goes sprawling to the ground. Now Doom's hand turns into a buzzsaw. He goes to administer the coup de grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Eddie's gonna be deady, just like Teddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOM>
<DIRECTION>
With his last ounce of strength, Valiant grabs the Acme Boxing Glove. He pops it. The glove extends across the room, punching the release lever on the dip truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - VALVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flood of dip gushes out of the valve and rolls toward Doom like a wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMS as the torrent hits him with a CRASH. But there's no escape for him this time. The flood of liquid envelopes him at the ankles. He dissolves into it like a melting candle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DIPMOBILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues forward inexorably. The arm is swinging towards Roger and Jessica. It gets closer and closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant tries to get to the truck, but it's too late. The cannon has reached them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ROGER AND JESSICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They close their eyes, preparing to meet their Maker. But nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spray of the cannon suddenly peters out. It dries up in a harmless drip as the tank has completely emptied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant gets to the controls of the power winch. He hoists Roger and Jessica up out of the way. The Dipmobile passes harmlessly underneath them and SMASHES through the brick wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOONTOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is REVEALED in all its splendor. It's a bucolic setting. A rainbow shares the blue sky with a smiling sun. Fawns and butterflies, chipmunks and flowers watch curiously as the dip truck rolls past. Suddenly it's lifted off the ground. We see it's resting on the top of a TOON GIANT's head. This Giant plucks the truck off his head, regards it, then pops it in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lowers Roger and Jessica to the ground. We HEAR POLICE SIRENS approach. When Valiant unties them, Jessica turns and exclaims...
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hero!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Then she hugs Roger passionately. Valiant can only shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WALL - TOONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
start coming in. They look around at the scene, bewildered, then gather around Doom's robe, mask and shoes lying in the puddle of dip. There's a reddish slick floating on top. Valiant wanders over and joins them.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi-ho, the Doom is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOOR
</DIRECTION>

Dolores, Lt. Santino, and several other COPS rush in, guns drawn. Dolores runs to Eddie and puts her arms around him. Santino looks down at the remains on the floor.

Valiant takes the paint chip out of his pocket. He puts it up against the red slime on the robe. It's a match.

<VALIANT>

	That was the murderer of Herman Acme, Maroon... and my brother.

Dolores looks down at the front of Valiant's shirt. A dark stain is appearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DOLORES>

	Eddie, we better get you to hospital. You're bleedin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOLORES>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant looks down at the stain.
</DIRECTION>
<VALIANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not blood. That's ink. That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALIANT>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose. Great gag.

<DIRECTION>
PAN the Toon crowd, who are listening to the reading of the will. It is a gallery of recognizable faces. Everyone from Mickey to Bugs, Yakky Doodle to Yosemite Sam, Dumbo to Dopey, Bambi to Droopy, Tweety Bird to Tinkerbell. They're all there.

The Toon crowd erupts with a CHEER! Hats go in the air and they descend on Roger, slapping his back. Roger breaks away from the crowd and joins Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - EDDIE AND ROGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand side by side, looking out over Toontown.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER_RABBIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Eddie, you still think I'm a patsy, a simp, a chump?

Roger lights Eddie's and one for himself.

</ROGER_RABBIT>
<DIRECTION>
Valiant glances down. The box says, "Acme Exploding Cigars". He looks to Roger, but it's too late. KABOOM! KABOOM! Their cigars blow up in classic Toon tradition, blackening both their faces. Roger starts laughing. Eddie stares at Roger for a moment, then he starts laughing too. They throw their heads back in a HOWL. The other Toons join in. Pretty soon the whole factory is shaking with LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TOON COP
