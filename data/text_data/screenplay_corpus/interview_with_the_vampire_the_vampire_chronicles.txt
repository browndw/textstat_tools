	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SAN FRANCISCO)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight coming through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. He is young, half-shaven, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. He looks too -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS, who stands by the window, looking out on the street, with his back to Malloy. Louis is dressed in an old-fashioned suit.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You followed me here, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a room...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So shall we begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(playfully, almost teasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a vampire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what a lucky break for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps lucky for both of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you my story. All of it. I'd like to do that very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure, fascinated but afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. Malloy is riveted.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS' FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to suppress fear and understand.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be frightened. I want this opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The light appears to go out by itself and suddenly Louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light from the window. The cassette is turning.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not lying to me, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...

EXT. LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial mansion of Pointe du Lac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate one in Greek Style.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had just lost my wife in childbirth. She and the infant had been buried less than half a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
There is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with a tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791 INFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis rips away the vines already covering the inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face is ashen.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was twenty-four and life seemed finished. I couldn't bear the pain of their loss. I longed for a release from it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WATERFRONT TAVERN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. All around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African freedmen.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to lose everything. My wealth, my estate, my sanity. But Lady Luck didn't oblige.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis displays a hand of four aces. A gambler at the table stands in fury, over turning money, cards, drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're calling me a cheat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<GAMBLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm calling you a piece of shit -
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAMBLER>
<DIRECTION>
The Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points it at Louis. The crowd hushes and draws back. Louis smiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace shirt, exposing his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then do me a favor. Get rid of this piece of shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Gambler's finger on the trigger. His hand shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lack the courage of your convictions, sir. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from beneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of all I longed for death. I know that now. I invited it, a release from the pain of living...

</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Gambler lowers his gun, scowling. Louis pockets the fistfulls of coins he has won.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians. Louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking from a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My invitation was open to anyone. Sailors, thieves, whores and slaves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHARF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her mouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the ground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore, off.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it was a vampire that accepted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on the wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He turns, to see Lestat, towering above him.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They would have killed you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then my luck would have changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want death? Is it death you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LOUIS' FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THEIR FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still want death? Or have you tasted it enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis can barely get the words out.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets into the water below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS' FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast.

<DIRECTION>
ON MALLOY'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Captivated, terrified, enthralled.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how it happened?

	No. The Gift of Darkness requires more than that, as you'll see.

EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish. He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>

INT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. Then he opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible - and angel or monster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?

</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel. Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand. Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand and throws it away. His hand begins to heal.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not afraid of anything, are you?

Louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to put that through me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were all last night's promises for nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out the sword.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis is becoming spellbound.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And it would be for all time? And sickness and death could never touch you again?

The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis' wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow, as if seen through some unearthly eye.

<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vampires, that's what we are. Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and child.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? To wave away anguish and grief? To embrace the peace of the unending night?
	</DIALOGUE>

The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife, Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear- streamed face. The child speaks.

INT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat places a hand on his forehead and soothes him.

Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat draws back, then stands up and goes to the French doors.

	The sun's coming up. Watch it carefully. If you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again.

He leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife.

	My last sunrise. That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, yet I don't remember any sunrise before it.

In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.

Sitting collected at the head of the steps.

Backs away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly he hardly seems to move.

</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair, flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your wife and child my friend. It's death. Just that simple. Think and choose. It happens to everyone. Except us.

Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat appears angelic in his radiance.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We shall be this way always, my friend. Young as we are now. I'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength. But I'm not that lonely. Do you want to come or not?

Louis capitulates in one long sigh.

</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...

</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks his blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming together. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as his blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing their focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS' POV

	I've drained you to the point of death. If you drink from me you live for ever. If I leave you here you die.

Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Don't leave me here. Give it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs slash his own flesh, blood falls.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VAMPIRE THEME swells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement. Louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS' POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp, the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground, astonished at the ease of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his buttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and color.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't I tell you it was going to be fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished Louis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is suddenly racked by shudders of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis dry-retches.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It happens to us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat wipes Louis' brow.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, you're going to feed now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in Louis' ears.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't matter anymore, Louis. You'll see. Come...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS' VAMPIRE POV - SWAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several share a bottle of rum around the fire. A male slave rises. A gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all beautiful now. Men, women, the old, the young...simply because they are alive. -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
The slave walks towards them in the darkness. A crucifix gleams round his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>

</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Louis hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Resist no more Louis. Feed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
The slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white beings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and sinks his teeth in his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent body shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands above, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly, engorged with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have fed. You were made for this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's laughter echoes around him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear God, what have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat laughs harder. Louis runs from him, screaming in anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said the slave had a crucifix...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that rumor about crosses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't look at them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The story about stakes through the heart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of harpsichord music come from the interior.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Killing is no ordinary act. It is the experience of another's life for certain. That night I had lost my own life and taken another's. I was drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret, with all the heightened senses of a vampire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there - quite the perfect vampire.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>

Dawn spreading over the plantation.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind. Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if I don't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he peers into it.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be afraid. In moments you'll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept. And when you awake I'll be waiting for you, and so will all the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told me something earlier. You said you didn't have a choice. Was that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat smiles bitterly and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday I'll tell you. We have a lot of time to talk to each other. You might say... we have all the time we shall ever need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of his prayer again.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear God, what have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Louis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of documents.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I awoke the next evening to a different world. And I realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable. Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis just stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sat there staring at him with contempt. He had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made. I felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat looks up at him and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat with loathing.
</DIRECTION>
<YVETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not hungry, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVETTE>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Au contraire, my dear. He could eat a horse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette. Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I looked at anything mortal and saw all life as precious, condemning all fruitless guilt and passion that would let it slip through the fingers like sand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Yvette returns his stare, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was only as a vampire that I could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear of me increased my desire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Yvette reaches for his uneaten plate. Louis stops her hand. Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the veins in her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and runs from the table. Lestat leans towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't give the game away. We're lucky to have such a home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
His hand snakes out under the table. It comes up holding a large grey rat.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretend to drink, at least.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He pours the blood into a crystal glass.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. It gets cold so fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't call it living. I'd call it surviving. A useful trick if you're caught for a month on a ship at sea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascination...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the rat away.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>

He rises. Louis follows.

A big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia dell'arte on the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs watch the show as tavern wenches move about.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was New Orleans, a magical and magnificent place to live. In which a vampire, richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree. Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring drinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to Lestat's lips as he flirts with her.
</DIRECTION>
<TERESA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, mon cher. The best in the colony. Once you touch this you'll never go to any other tavern again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERESA>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so, cherie? But what if I'd rather taste your lips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<TERESA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lips are even sweeter still...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERESA>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then runs it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTICS ON THE STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter rocks the tavern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair beside him and folds her hands on the table. No one notices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches Louis' knee.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.

EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the tavern. Louis looks up at the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been caught?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>

</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the triumphant kill of Lestat was a young man. They represented the greatest loss to Lestat because they stood on the threshold of the maximum possibility of life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
A youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against French windows. He is talking to an elegant widow, seated, holding two manicured poodles. Lestat stares at the youth with longing.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read her thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Louis closer to them.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take my word for it. She blamed a slave for his murder. And do you know what they did to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>

</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAWNS - NIGHT

Lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a delicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet spills from the french windows.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW_ST_CLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, young man, you really amaze me! I'm old enough to be your grandmother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW_ST_CLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
She leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He allows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms, gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She swoons.
</DIRECTION>
<WIDOW_ST_CLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's the melody, I remember it. Oh yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIDOW_ST_CLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Louis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but still alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREES - NIGHT

Lestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A scream pierces the night.

</WIDOW_ST_CLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth and breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You whining coward of a vampire who prowls the night killing rats and poodles. You could have finished us both!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary force, pummeling him towards the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know any hell -

Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength he never knew he had.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see me kill? Watch me kill you then -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What strength, my friend, what strength. I remember why I chose you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feed on what you want, mon cherie. Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll leave you to it and watch you come round. Just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable...

He smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.

Their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first fingers of light spread across the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Yvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<YVETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We worry about you master. When do you ride about the fields? How long since you've been to the slave quarters? Everywhere there is death. Animals, men. Are you our master still at all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Louis watches her sadly. He's getting hungry. Her throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone now, Yvette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<YVETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not go unless you listen to me. Send away this new friend of yours. The slaves are frightened of him. They are frightened of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart. She touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am frightened of myself, Yvette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply, withdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with blood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stands.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush, Yvette -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
She screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her mouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing the empty glasses and crockery to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it, revolted. He carries her body outside, grief-stricken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drumming grows louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins. The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of Yvette. He is deranged with grief.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is cursed. Damned, do you hear me? And your master is the devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>

</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

They don't move. They stare at him blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlike me, you are no free men...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have to convince you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window, lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAVES POV - MASTER

<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We can see this in his face, the texture of his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can see the morning sky.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You loved your wife, surely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He looks directly at Malloy, shocking him with his gaze.

A lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy French furniture. Open to rooftops of colonial city. Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city. Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow female voices. Louis turns and sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores. One runs her finger down his chest. The other seems out of it.

The girl screams. Louis puts his hands to his ears. Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her neck. She dies at last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A terrible silence descends. Lestat looks at Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...

EXT. DANK NEW ORLEANS BACK STREETS - NIGHT

A rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another. Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind, walking down the street, gripping one, then another.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I damned? Am I from the devil? Is my very nature that of a devil? And all the while, as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
A smaller side street, in which every house is marked with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis is following them. A man passes with a lantern.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go that way Monsieur. It's the plague. Go back the way you came.

He walks on, following the rats.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying.

A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it.

<CLAUDIA>

	Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm frightened, please wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
As Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. Her eyes are being eaten away by rats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis gasps in horror. Claudia turns. She is a radiant doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur, please help us. Papa's waiting for us at the ship. Please wake mama, Monsieur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>

She runs to him. Instinctively, he gathers her in his arms. He looks down pitying on her beautiful face.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if I am damned, why do I fell such pity for her gaunt face? Why do I wish to warm her tiny arms? Comfort her beating heart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
She snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. She tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. And we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon. Gradually another sound replaces it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child in his arms. He sees Lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, my philosopher, my martyr. "Never take a human life". Well you must admit it is funny. Or is it merely touching? I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and talking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's make some party of it, shall we? Maybe there's some life in the old lady yet?
	</DIALOGUE>

Louis flees into the street.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For years I had not savored a human. And when I had Lestat's words made sense to me. I knew peace only when I killed and when I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm I knew again what peace could be. Yet even then I could not contenance it...

The same sewer-pipe. Now the bodies of dead rats lie all around. A pair of fine leather boots splash through the water - Lestat's.

</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>

Louis runs at him, but Lestat brushes him aside effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. Lestat bites his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's mouth... He winces in pain.

	That's it dear. More. You must drink it to get well.

A cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought of all the things I had done and couldn't undo. And I longed for one second's peace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walks towards the doors, inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis enters. The dim lights of candles. A sacristan tending the altar, an old woman praying - otherwise empty.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no fear. If anything I longed for something to happen, for the stones to tremble as I entered the foyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walking down the nave of the church. He stops by the alter.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost genuflected from old habit. I almost prayed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis sits in a pew.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then it struck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS' POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cross, the statues, the tabernacle.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if the statues gave an image to nothing? What if I was the supernatural in this cathedral? The only immortal under this roof. And I felt nothing but loneliness. Loneliness to the point of madness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. Louis almost jumps. He turns and sees the face of a grey-haired priest.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wish to go to confession? I was about to lock up the church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stares at him, tears in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are troubled, aren't you? Can I help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LOUIS>
<PREIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's never too late. Come...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREIST>
<DIRECTION>
The priest gestures to the confessional. Louis rises, slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFESSIONAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, kneeling in the darkness. The hatch slides back.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bless me father for I have sinned so often and so long, I don't know how to change nor beg for forgiveness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, God is infinite in his capacity to forgive. Tell him from your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murders, father, death after death. The woman who died two nights ago in Jackson Square, I killed her. And thousands of others before her. I have walked the streets of New Orleans like the Grim reaper. And fed on human life for my own. I am a vampire, father, and have turned the one I love most of all into on too -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The hatch slams down. Louis rises, confused, and the door is flung open, the priest stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know the meaning of sacrilege?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
Louis rises. Walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there is no mercy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
His face comes into the light. The priest steps back, open-mouthed.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You talk of sacrilege. Why if God exists does he suffer me to exist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He bares his fangs. The priest runs, screaming. Gets to the bellrope, begins to ring the bell. Louis swoops on him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does he suffer me to live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his feet stop kicking.

INT. FLAT - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>

</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. She is wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls, weirdly adult and seductive. She comes towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can't hate you Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the aroma of a mortal child?

</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She whispers.

	Louis. Lover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>

She kisses his cheek.

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was mortal to you. You gave me your immortal kiss. You became my mother and my father. And so I'm yours. Forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>

She takes his face in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>

<LOUIS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we made plans. She was convinced there were others of our kind in Europe, that they would have the answers Lestat couldn't provide. Lestat whom she now hated, who she thought she could be free of. I doubted, but then she had a surprise in store...

</LOUIS>

</LESTAT>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that supposed to frighten me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LESTAT>

	You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.

Louis perks up, puzzled.

<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop pestering me then!

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
	</DIALOGUE>

Claudia stares at him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better than that.

She takes his hand and leads him into an inner room. Louis follows behind.

</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a table full with a half-eaten meal. Lestat sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful. I thought of you when I saw them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We forgive each other then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia stares at him, sitting. She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks greedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without expression. He finished one, is about to take the other when he staggers. He looks at Claudia.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absinthe? You gave them absinthe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her, then slips to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laudanum!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.

</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat tries to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them... and let me drink...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.

</CLAUDIA>

She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes from it.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift - help me -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia lacerates his face. Blood pours from everywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies. Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done, Claudia -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the room. She hisses at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis! Look what's happening to him!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment, his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face. His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and brings her finger to her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde hair.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead, Claudia, dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up, all business suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me. We must get rid of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead youths.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere. Overhanging creepers.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if we find the one who made him? Do we tell him we destroyed his own creation? The vampire Lestat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators, as they attack the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms. He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there, saying nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>

</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. Go away from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the first time in years. She is weeping copiously.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudia - You're crying -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
We see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is heartbroken, lost.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you never cried -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.

Louis gathers her in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -

</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walks her towards the carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you Claudia. Always. And we are free now, Claudia. No Lestat. Just the two of us, beginning the great adventure of our lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving the silent waters of the swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FLAT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of the apartment. All the furniture is covered in white sheets. Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The birds. We forgot about the birds. There's nothing for it but to let them go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knocking on the door. Claudia falters.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?

</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -

He goes downstairs. Claudia plays a moment, then stops, perturbed. She goes to the window. Then sees something out there that makes her face go white. She screams.

Reaches the stairs. She screams -

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't Louis -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
But Louis has opened the door. Nothing there. He looks back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when, swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled, bloodshot. he roars.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT ACCURSED CHILD?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis throws his body against the door, slamming it on Lestat's reaching hand. The hand withdraws, as Lestat roars. Louis bolts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms, watching appalled as the door shudders with the force of Lestat's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PARLOUR

Louis runs through with Claudia in his arms.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It is! Take the back stairwell -

Suddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window, scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the shattered glass. He tumbles to the floor and gets unsteadily to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis throws Claudia behind him and hurls himself on Lestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his broken body coming off in the process. Then with a terrifying effort, Lestat hurls Louis off, goes for Claudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace, scatters burning coals over him. He falls back, then comes at her again, as the drapes catch fire. Louis grabs the lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay back - for the love of God... or I'll burn you alive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat lunges again at Claudia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis hurls the lamp, which explodes him in flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat screams in agony, whirls around the room, then comes on Claudia again. She hurls another lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping him further in fire. Lestat falls to his knees, choking, hands up over his face in the smoke. The whole parlor is afire. Louis gathers up Claudia, smothering the burning house, carries her down the back stairs, through the carriage way and through the gathering crowds of mortals into the street.

	Though the fire seemed to spread through the quartier, I stood on that deck until dawn, fearful he would come out again of the very river like some monster to destroy us both.

	We reached the Mediterranean. I wanted those waters to be blue. They were black, nighttime waters and how I suffered then, straining to remember the color that a young man's senses had taken for granted, that my memory had let slip away for eternity. It was black off the coast of Italy, black off the coast of Greece, Europe itself was black.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The quest for these Old World vampires filled me with bitterness. We searched village after village, ruin after ruin and I was glad when always we found nothing. For what could the damned really have to say to the damned?

</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary. I was a Creole, after all and Paris was the mother of New Orleans, a universe whole and entire unto herself...

EXT. STREET - SHOP WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through the glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes. She peers deep into the shop and sees -

<DIRECTION>
MADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting a doll's face, oblivious to being watched.

By a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes. She is covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears.

She twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then stops, stares at herself.

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't remember? Or you never knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was something hurries...and seldom savored... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.

</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how will I ever know, Louis?

EXT. BOULEVARD - EVENING

Louis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father and daughter. All around them are bourgeois Parisian families on their evening stroll. Claudia points at the children that pass.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I anything in common with her, Louis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>

She points to a beautiful French child walking by with her mother.

Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The resemblance is uncanny.

<CLAUDIA>

	Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Madeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know her?

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?

He takes her arm. But Claudia shakes him off, and moves into the shop.

Louis walks briskly, head bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a time we had been almost human, in the sensual whirl of what Paris had to offer. But the human delights of that city only served to remind her of the ageless child she had become. I felt her pain as I walked until I become aware that I was being followed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - LOUIS' FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking. A step echoes his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stops. Turns, sees nothing. Then walks again. The echoing steps begin again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis again. Sees a shadow, flitting.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. He walks again, hears the same effect. Then he stops. He stares at a gaslamp opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it was when I had given up the search for vampires that a vampire found me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the gaslight. And Louis gradually realizes that this vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes and hair-style as Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. Santiago mimics. Louis takes a step forwards. Santiago mimics. Louis folds his arms. Santiago mimics.
</DIRECTION>

Louis calculates.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trickster. Buffoon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Santiago echoes the first word, but not the second. Louis has broken his composure. He turns his back on Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've searched the world for an immortal and this is what I find?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his midriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at Louis, throwing him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks both ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares, awestruck, at this new one:
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks like an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis reads it aloud, as we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES By Special Invitation Friday, 9 p.m."
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring the petit beauty with you. No one will harm you. I won't allow it. Remember my name. Armand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Armand bows and vanishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis listens to the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on his arm. They pass people buying tickets for the theatre and go inside.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember what I've told you. They'll have different powers. They'll read your thoughts if you allow it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
They draw close to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE POSTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reading -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH By Edgar Allen Poe"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The posters are illustrated with cliched images of vampires overcoming damsels in distress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Warily, they show their invitations to the mortal ticket taker at the door. He glances away indifferently.

INT. THEATRE BOX - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go down.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.

	They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Stage: curtain rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle. Death standing before it, the traditional image of the Grim Reaper, complete with magnificent scythe.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a vampire. It's the one I saw in Rue St Jacques.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
A version of the Poe story unfolds before them. All of the participants are vampires. All beautiful gleaming white, aged 20 or 30.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How devilishly clever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
A spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out upon the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's no vampire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal Woman comes into the footlights. She is too beautiful, too confused. Santiago, as Death, advances on her. She backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTAL_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTAL_WOMAN>

She looks around in panic. Santiago swoons, arms over his breast as if he is hopelessly in love.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are death!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>

The Mortal Woman steps to the footlights.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<MORTAL_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would take my chance. Let me go! Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTAL_WOMAN>
<SANTIAGO>

	And if you take that chance and live, what is your fate? The humpbacked toothless visage of old age?

Santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of her peasant blouse. It opens completely and starts to slip. She tries to catch it, but gently stops her wrists. The blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.

MORTAL WOMAN

Shakes her head. She is helpless.

	We alone can give death meaning. Do you know what it means to be loved by death, to become our bride?

</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Mortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or fainting. But then her eyes mist over. She is being entranced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the wings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago. Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No pain.

He pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTAL_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No pain...

Armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark against her black clothes, then he passes her to the other vampires one by one.

</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor. The vampires seem to vanish one by one. As the curtain draws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they presume are theatrical tricks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty theatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience, Louis. Patience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than when the play was on. The red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a box. Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in the box, looking down on them. He stares with a dreamy expression, saying nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been searching for you for a very long time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
His voice echoes eerily. Armand gestures for them to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens into a -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walls are painted with famous copies of Durer, Brueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death. Fine wooden coffins line the walls. Candles burn in sconces, casting alternate shadows and pools of light. Armand walks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk through, vampire man and women appear out of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting around them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she were a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armand gestures to the vampires to back off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All obey but ESTELLE.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such a darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<DIRECTION>
She menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs bared. Armand throw her a look, and she is flung against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stares around. The vampires faces drift towards him and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring at Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. Then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candelabra, which he hands to Armand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armand and the boy come towards them, leading them along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above the candleflame.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monstrous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and very beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your lips, they didn't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places his arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand, who smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing. The other vampires appear all around Louis, who suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEDIEVAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan, being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had feared we were the only ones...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how did you come into existence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you the leader of this group?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there were a leader, I would be the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you have the answers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! You have questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing if not vampires...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who made us what we are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surely you know the one who made you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks at the picture. Armand watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is a picture, nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean we are not children of Satan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there is nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He passes his finger through the candle flame.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then God does not exist...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have not spoken to him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young. His eyes hold them both in a trance.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading their souls.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knew? You mean he is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder, interrupting.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, beloved. It's time we were on our way. I'm hungry and the city waits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She stares hard at Armand. Armand looks from her to Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So soon to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARKENED CORRIDORS AND THEATRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis and Claudia feel their way through darkened corridors, trying to find their way out.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The place was dark as we left, a darkness that confounded even Claudia. And as we blundered through it, again came the thought: I have wronged Lestat, I have hated him for the wrong reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a light comes on. They see they are in the empty theatre. Santiago stands on the stage, under a candle.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you wrong him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You read my thoughts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said a name -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A name I don't want to say again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seemed to recognize it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Other vampires appear behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is but one crime among us vampires here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Claudia.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should know, who are so secretive about the vampire who made you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boredom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the crime that means death to any vampire. To kill your own kind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be born like Venus out of the foam, as we were! Come Louis, let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL SAINT GABRIEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia and Louis enter the Lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loathe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What danger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
They come to their room, enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOMS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis closes the door behind him. Claudia paces.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I would let them harm you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him. A strange, sad, adult smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you felt it too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go, he said. Let him go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She touches his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what I should do Louis? Let you go? My father? My lover? My Louis, who made me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears in her eyes. Louis lifts her up in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can protect us, Claudia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOLL-SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia, staring at the dolls. We see Madeleine inside, painting a doll. She sees Claudia and smiles and waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw back, to show Santiago as death, as before. Louis takes advantage of the darkness to slip away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMAND'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armand opens the door to Louis' knock.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was waiting for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He follows Armand into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your lover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, my beloved, my child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you say so. You are innocent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then blame the one who made her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want no quarrel with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I leave too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Armand smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said there were none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what the one who made me said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How he must have loved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, I need you more than he ever did. I need a link with this century. The world changes. We do not. Therein lies the irony that ultimately kills us. I need you to make contact with this age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Louis laughs bitterly.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He? Don't you see? I'm not the spirit of any age! I'm at odds with everything and always have been! I'm not even sure what I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Armand smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Louis, that is the very spirit of your age. The heart of it. You fall from grace has been the fall of a century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the vampires of the Theatre?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these not the answers you came for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... My God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lestat! You knew Lestat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Armand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him towards the back wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you must go now. You must get her safely out of Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a hidden door in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No-one else knows of this door. When you knock you will find me waiting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt a kind of peace at last. I had found the teacher which Lestat could never, I knew now, have been. I knew knowledge would never be withheld by Armand. It would pass through him as through a pane of glass. And I knew Claudia must leave me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis enters. There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a doll sitting by the mirror. Louis looks in the mirror and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MADELEINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap. Claudia's arms are wound round her neck. The contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madeleine... Louis is shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Madeleine rises and comes towards Louis. She draws back the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the two marks there. She says softly, dreamily.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Louis turns away. Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it Louis. Because I cannot do it. I haven't the strength. You saw to that when you made me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis turns to Madeleine.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Louis pushes her away. Claudia screams.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have found your new companion, Louis! You will make me mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis grips Madeleine and shakes her.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She points to Madeleine
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You give her to me! Do this before you leave me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to weep, sobbing like a child.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks at Madeleine
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You promise to care for her then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know what you ask for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
She wraps her arms around Claudia.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A child who can't die...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Her finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis touches it, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOCKET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful, beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the child who did die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the gaslight. Don't take your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELEINE>
<DIRECTION>
Louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain coming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains, alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Louis speaks without turning.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if she dies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only mortal death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to look at Claudia.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps years. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes father. At last. We are een.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the wafting curtains. He sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silhouetted, coming closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks up and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CURTAINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge through.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>

The vampires close on them as Louis struggles, Claudia's scream pierces the night air.

INT. CORRIDOR OF THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine are forced down the dark corridor. Into -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vampire chaos, as they are dragged through. Louis struggling like a demon.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't countenance this -

</LOUIS>

</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
Santiago strikes Louis to the ground. As he struggles to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure coming through. He gasps at the sight of -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the fire as well as the earlier stabbing. Lestat is confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's shoulder to steady himself.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he the one?

Lestat shakes his head.

The sound of something being dragged through the crowd. Horrible echoing, scraping -

Lestat grips Santiago.

	You promised me - I could take him back to New Orleans - Louis - there's something I must tell you - about that night - that night I met you -

He stares around him, confused. The scraping gets louder.

<SANTIAGO>

</SANTIAGO>

We see now what caused the scraping. A huge metal coffin being dragged through the vampires. Claudia screams.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTIAGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walled in a dungeon. Your only company will be your screams... Perhaps it will take centuries...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTIAGO>
<DIRECTION>
The vampires grab Louis. They force him towards the coffin. Lestat struggles with them.

<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've fooled you, Lestat! You must reach Armand! Armand has the power!

</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, struggling in the coffin. Then the lid is forced down, huge locks closed over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, in the smallest imaginable space. Beating his forehead against the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COFFIN

<DIRECTION>
Claudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying. She is dragged away. Vampire hands drag the coffin across the stone floor.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Louis, forehead pouring with blood, being thrown this way and that. The coffin is lifted, upside down, Louis' head crashes off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed over, mortar trowelled on.

He loses consciousness.

INT. COFFIN

Louis sleeps, upside down. Sound of bricks being broken, thrown aside. Then of locks breaking.

Louis opens his eyes. The lid opens. He sees -

<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Above him, reaching down to take his hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry. Don't make a sound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. Louis runs to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.

<LOUIS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me - that way - through my cell -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
He points to his cell at the end of the passage, the foot of the steps. Sound of rain beyond the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not without Claudia. Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't save her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<DIRECTION>
Louis runs up the stone stairs. It leads to the ballroom. He enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. She lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it. A male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Indifference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up to Lestat, who looks up at him, confused. He's holding something crumpled, made of cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll come home with me Louis? For a little while... until I am myself again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CLAUDIA!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis turns round and round in rage. Passive still faces. A door bangs open and shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks again at Lestat. He snatches the cloth from Lestat's hand. We see it is a small torn bloodstained dress. Claudia's dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bangs again. Estelle laughs. Rain gusts into the ballroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis goes to the door, holding the dress. Armand approaches, trying to pull him away, but Louis shrugs him off. He draws nearer and nearer and stairs at -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRICK AIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes, in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and daughter in the New Orleans graveyard, embracing each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair remain unburnt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many stories to the sky. He cries out in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into the rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the wind, they whirl around the warring figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the airwell, towards the night sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NOTRE DAME DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis is slumped against the stone wall. Armand stands beside him like a guardian angel.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't prevent it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You let them do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis climbs to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, I swear I did not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And I warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favor - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.

EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wet and deserted, the streets around the theatre are quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chiming five a.m.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON LOUIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at the paling sky. He is in an alleyway, outside of Armand's cell. He has a huge keg with him. he finds the door unlocked. He enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty. The hearth is cold. The old coffin is gone. Louis silently closes the door to the passage and blocks it with an immense bar. He goes in the other door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis hurls kerosene all over the stage, the curtain, the sets, the seats below. He grabs the scythe from the playlet. He walks out. Dribbling a trail of kerosene behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of kerosene. He creeps quietly into the -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaking kerosene from the cask. He splashes over the coffins that gleam in the dimness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he strikes a match and heaves it into the kerosene. Everything bursts into flame. The trail of kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the coffins and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSIONS of fire from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He readies the scythe, like the grim reaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESTELLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run through the fire but Louis slashes her down with the scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in flames.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop him. It's morning. The sunlight. Stop him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTELLE>
<DIRECTION>
Others rise, choking in the smoke. Screams from everywhere. They are burning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis backs up the stairs to the -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUNGEON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see there a thin pale light under Armand's bolted door. Suddenly -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANTIAGO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes at him from behind. Louis turns. Santiago rushes him in a blur. Louis swings the scythe, too fast to see what he himself is doing. Santiago's head streaming blood flies through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body drops, flapping its arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMS come from everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another vampire rushes burning towards Louis. He decapitates him in turn. Then he staggers into Armand's cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom behind him. He staggers to the outer door. There is a thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him. He throws it open, and staggers into the daylight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the thin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street. He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAGNIFICENT HEARSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door of the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the interior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis and pulls him inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the spectacle of the burning theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed, exposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on around it, oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is already a museum by this time and Louis and Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it. They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't even warm them, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet you knew what I would do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were their leader. They trusted you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>

He looks at Louis affectionately.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your melancholy eyes...

<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?

</LOUIS>
<ARMAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are a pair, and that's what counts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMAND>

Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre together. Camera follows them for a while, then comes to rest on a sunrise by Turner.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We left Paris shortly after. For years we wandered. Greece, Egypt, all the ancient lands. Then, out of curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who knows what, I took him home, to my America...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deco cinema of the twenties. Louis and Armand, dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle through the crowded seats.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there, a technological wonder allowed me see sunrise, for the first time in two hundred years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
On the screen, Murnau's "Sunrise", in black and white. We see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of movies, in black and white.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what sunrises! Seen as the human eye could never see them. We would sit in the dark, night after night among nameless humans, entranced with the miracle of light. Silver at first, then as the years progressed in tones of purple, red and my long-lost blue...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The SUNRISES continue, in color now, and the backgrounds in them change to the fifties.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in time parted. We had become so alike, we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The lights come up in a different theatre. Louis sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed in the clothes of the fifties. He rises, exits with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. Louis emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had returned to new Orleans. As soon as I smelt the air, I knew I was home. There was sadness there, rich, almost sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine. I walked the streets, savoring it like a long lost perfume...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then on Prytania Street, only blocks from the Lafayette cemetery I caught the scent of death and it wasn't coming from the graves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS OVER white-walled Lafayette cemetery and its surrounding mansions.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The scent grew stronger as I walked. Old death. A scent too faint for mortals to detect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis sees rats darting across the street. They rush into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined mansion. No lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stops at a rusted gate. He forces it open and enters -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VERITABLE JUNGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass window of a huge Greek Revival house. He approaches then he sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OLD SHRIVELLED CORPSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny rosevines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the roots of an oak overgrowing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the distant light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose vine, only bones and clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew what it meant. A vampire had lured them here, but had been to weak to get rid of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It spelt weakness, madness, the behavior of a dying animal that pollutes its own lair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves along the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked books. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the books. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare, except for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A single mirror reflecting the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead rats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The candle flickers inside. He sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near starvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets. His clothes are rags. Blond hair beautiful, as always.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One tiny candle stands beside him. He reads an early comic, from the turn of the century. Without turning his head, he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...

</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...

</LESTAT>

He turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.

<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by, piercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red flashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his ears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him, until the lights pass over.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only a siren...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they frighten you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>

Louis shivers. He releases him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Louis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to his candle, his magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll come back, Louis... take me out... little by little... and maybe I'll be myself again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>

A bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and grabs it, squeezes the blood.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Lestat...
	</DIALOGUE>

ON LOUIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my story ends there. But in fact it ended a long time ago, with Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My love died with her. I never really changed after that. What became of Lestat I have no idea. I go on, night after night. I feed on those who cross my path. But all my passion went with her yellow hair. I ma a spirit with preternatural flesh. Detached. unchangeable. Empty.

</LOUIS>
<MALLOY>

He looks at the boy. Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings them to his throat. Malloy screams, in involuntary terror.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like it? You like being food for the immortals? You like dying? Is it beautiful? Is it intense?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy, now terrified, whispers
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
Louis drops him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy, falls on the floor, terrified. When he looks up, Louis has vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis... Louis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the tape. It is still turning.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head. He gets up, and with shaking fingers gathers his tapes. He runs out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy running for his car, a convertible. He leaps in and screeches off through the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in sheer, unfocused terror.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge. He breathes deeply, to calm himself. He takes a tape from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks it in the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1791. That's when it happened. I was twenty-four. Younger then you are now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat, pulls his neck backwards -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sinks his teeth in his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALLOY'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALLOY'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bulging, as the life drains out of him. Lestat sucking him like a rat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swinging free of Malloy's dying hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Veers wildly into oncoming traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drinks regardless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming towards them, about to crush the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT'S BONY HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Misses the truck by inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throws Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tape is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My invitation was open to anyone. Sailors, whores, thieves. But it was a vampire that accepted...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
ON LESTAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger seat. He smiles. We can see the blood renewing him.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Louis... will I ever forget?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTAT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lestat drives on, the car a tiny speck against the bridge, the sea, the sky beyond, with the first fingers of light spreading through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
