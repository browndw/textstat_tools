EXT. FOREST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven. Moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb. The setting is tranquil and utterly majestic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams scintillate in an etheral ballet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Numerous small animals gather to behold this wonder. They stand on the hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural enemies untied by the radiant LIGHT.

A snarling face APPEARS under a mushroom cap. This is BLIX a brigand goblin hunter. Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, he is a terrifying figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blix WHISTLES. The SOUND is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further back, three other goblins return the BIRDCALL. They bristle with weaponry. POX is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and flithy brocade. Tiny BLUNDER and TIC are both masked by grotesque helmets. Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads. They creep forward to join Blix.

Blix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest towards the hilltop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head. He turns. His incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the moth and retracting with it, quick as a flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic LIGHT gradually illuminates their hideous features. A tiny mouse runs out of the eye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The goblins crawl separately through the underbrush.

A miasmic Jurassic swamp. Stunted trees rise like amputated limbs from the fetid water.

A v-shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged crocodile.

Blix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting out of the water like a petrified serpant.

Below, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable binding her to an iron windlass.

The Princess paces the dark and dripping cell. Her dress is in tatters, her hair tangled. There is something wild and free about her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a small demonic shape as it falls.

We hear the BEATING of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip. The sound grows LOUDER and LOUDER until the echo reverberates within the vaulted chamber.

The iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, her eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion.

Lili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion luring her toward the open doorway.

INT. SEALED CORRIDOR DAY

Jack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal shut tight. There is less space than in a closet. The corridor behind them is completely bricked over.
</DIRECTION>
<GUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trapped....!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUMP>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DOOR With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the thick wood like stiletties. Their needle tips are mere inches from Jack and Gump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door's inner surface is studded with talons. Jack suddenly SLAMS the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a loud CRASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pygmies' frenzied SCREAMING ends in abrupt SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Gump peer cautiously out.

INT. GREAT HALL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall Baroque columns. Winged demons writhe in the shadows above. A long black table reaches down the centre of the room. All is lit by firelight. The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental sculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in a hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken. She stares in terror at her news surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped shadows. It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like a ghost across the black marble floor. There is no one wearing the garment!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her. She finds it irresistable. Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to dance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lili dances by herself, turning slow dreamy circles before the blazing fire. She is now WEARING the splendid black gown!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reflected firelight GLITTERS in the shadows. An open jewel box spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table. Lili is lure like a moth to the flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table. The ebony casket brims with gemstones. Lili's eyes dazzle. A carved ebony figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind can imagine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess sucks in her breath. The temptation is too great. She impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and without thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, concentrating on the tricky clasp. All at once, a piece of sculpture becomes ANIMATE. Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace. For a moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help. Then, she realises what is happening and SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror. Lili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall cheval glass mirror. She looks furtively about, making certain she is unobserved. Alone, she admires her perfect image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIRROR Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil face of Darkness APPEAR like a man emerging from under water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness penetrates the surface of the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lili backs away, GASPING soundlessly with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black finery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lili staggers. Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess SHRIEKS at the top of her lungs. The moment he touches her shoulder, she slumps tothe floor, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like muffled thunder. Something almost like a smile creases his hideous features as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess blinks and opens her eyes. She is horrified to find Darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away.

Jack stands his ground, greatsword poised, as the huge black stallion gallops towards him, hooves striking SPARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn ROARS slavering past.
</DIRECTION>

The greatsword passes straight through the black beast, as if it were striking a ghost.

Jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge, but he manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black unicorn's red eyes BLAZE as he crashes into Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Green Man is thrown awkwardly to one side. He loses the greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground.

Dazed, Jack rises on his elbows.. He sees the black hooves of Darkness standing before him.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rearing, the unicorn arches her neck and tosses Darkness over toe edge into the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness tumbles into the haze. His final HOWL is a lament from the depths of Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last moment, the falling figure of Darkness TRANSFORMS into the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows.

High above the faerie celebration, beautiful MUSIC is HEARD. It is Gump, playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine. Delicate as the call of a meadow lark, Gump's music rises sweetly into the heavens. It is just dawn. The sun's GLOW blazes in the east.

EXT. MEADOW DAY

<DIRECTION>
A lush broad expanse, boldly pattered with wild flowers. Breasting the waving grass like a swimmer in the sea, the unicorn bounds joyfully in total freedom.
