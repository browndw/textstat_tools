A BLACK VOID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses... the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an eerie, alien cacophony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion. Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we REVEAL we are in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BORG RECON CENTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall. We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre -- a mixture of organic and mechanical elements. Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises. Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera, vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The screens show everything from written Chinese... to Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of space battles from the 24th century. The entire range of human history dancing across the monitors. The effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever is watching this is studying the human race.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of voices speaking at once :
</DIRECTION>
<BORG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Restrict search parameters to 1-9- 9-8 through 2-0-8-4.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORG>
<DIRECTION>
The images on the monitors now change to show us images from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, it's a collection of still photography, video footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound- bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of enticing details. As the images race across the monitors, we should learn the following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos. Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations. Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions, environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The United States ceases to exist. All political authority vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second Dark Age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the human race.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an alien civilization brings the planet together as never before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning to solve long-standing problems with new technology. We see an early replicator producing food for the starving millions. A new World Government is formed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star Trek universe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic inflection, speaks for the first time:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE

A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this is just one small part of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. It's a spectacular sight.
</DIRECTION>

The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading off in another direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it doesn't look like it can take much more of this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship, causing massive damage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered starship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this Enterprise is ready for anything.

Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls, floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg that form a gigantic "hive" mind. The Borg are half- man/half machine. No individual personalities. No feelings. They have only one goal in life: to assimilate new races into their collective. To become a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak, they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices speaking as one:

On the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES. There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders connecting the different levels.

INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on against the force of the wind...
</DIRECTION>

INT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS. VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead, struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm, keeps her from flying out.

Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly open and he looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints. He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable to break the restraints. About two feet in front of his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching, hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DATA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And we realize we're in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BORG HIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG. The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical jungle of cybernetic equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet technology and materials into the living, bio- mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and other conduits connecting them to various equipment... while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying out various modifications to the room. At one point, we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified. His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DATA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still strapped to the table, which is twisting and rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are clustered together in one section of the room, each with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits connected to its face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem to lead toward the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of optical cabling to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DATA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Borg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your efforts to assimilate me will be unsuccessful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DATA>
<DIRECTION>
The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power. They're trying to connect him to the Collective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly... and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.
</DIRECTION>
<DATA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Borg)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would appear that resistance is not always futile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DATA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brave words. I've heard them before from thousands of species across thousands of worlds... since long before you were created.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Data looks up toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CEILING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle... almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale- skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back... a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish technology. And then it's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DATA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make of it.

	You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.

Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six- inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head...

EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people -- a rural, Western community that's probably existed for at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of the original ranching community in some of the architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st century.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The most striking feature of the town is that it sits in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which provide the only source of power for the town. The blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek, fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the sight of the city and then head toward it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of post-apocalyptic 21st century life:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a recognizable American community, but it's definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture, technology -- all have changed over the course of seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER- CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements now useless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT -- the inside surface is covered with condensation and we can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What used to be a McDonald's, or some other recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and tongs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves, others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies -- victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as people line up to get their daily rations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look about them. They're going through something that makes the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience. But there's also a toughness to these people, a resilience and determination to survive in the face of overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and it's on the verge of collapse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered, tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard times. The light in the room is provided mostly from the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital -- we get the feeling they have very little power.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>

The back of the building. Picard rushes out and spots an old, dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the hospital. He quickly yanks off the back panel, revealing a tangle of wires, and several large batteries. He kneels down, then removes the back of the tricorder.

INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns to Picard.

Everyone turns.

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence we can see in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard realizes he has to say something. He looks into her eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was some kind of explosion out at the missile silo...

EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY

A short time later. Picard walking down the main street back toward the gates. People passing him, taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of the car. She continues on her way. Picard is intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is she could be taking a picture of. Just then --
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch.

</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal canister with a screw-top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia. While not a physically threatening man, there is a quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility. He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his friendliest face to Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<SCRIMM>

Picard steps around him and continues walking down the street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him again.

	That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?

</SCRIMM>
<PICARD>

<SCRIMM>

He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<SCRIMM>

A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Be sure you put that on. You need a lot of protection around here.

He holds Picard's eyes for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. But I've never had much trouble protecting myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm. Picard walks around him and heads for the gates. Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression -- clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful- looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf hits his combadge.

INT. BRIDGE

Riker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at the security station looking at a monitor which displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are on Deck 46.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>

He nods to Troi, who works a console.

INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the hatch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the light around the darkened corridor, then silently motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then we see the security officers start to drop into the corridor from the hatch above...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at- the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers. We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their own light sources, intended to illuminate the target before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are constantly moving their lights back and forth through the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet, stop, and take up firing positions... then two more members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them and take positions further down the corridor. Classic military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a tricorder.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WORF>
<DIRECTION>
The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky, eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They open doors, check room by room, section by section, still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall, ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off an eerie glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can also see that some of the machinery has been altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads -- there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring, equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward, examines the corridor closely.

<DIRECTION>
Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue their search. They continue making their way down the spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly into the room, but clearly something is going on in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on Environmental Control.
</DIRECTION>
<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.

</RIKER_S_COM_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation, covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him, throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<WORF>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative. However, they've reconfigured the ODN network... and re-routed all power on this deck into Environmental Control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORF>
<DIRECTION>
As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes, brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his imagination?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast we have trouble following it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worf turns his head at the sound.

Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But just as they start to fall back, everything happens at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BORG DRONES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and furious we never get a true sense of what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flurry of violence and motion and images:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a cybernetic nightmare.
</DIRECTION>

But the Borg are already on top of them. It's a brutal fight in close quarters with no escape.

Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor, bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and terror. The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that they don't have a chance...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Worf pushes his men down the corridor. Everyone turns and RUNS like hell. Worf bends down and grabs a frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.

VARIOUS SHOTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The team running through the corridors, SHOOTING behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect...
</DIRECTION>

-- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER BURSTS out of their arms and wrists, taking DOWN two Security Guards. Worf sees them fall but there's no time to go back.

As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety. The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf. He quickly hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload. We hear the building WHINE. He JUMPS straight up into the air, GRABBING onto the hatch rim, pulling himself up. He barely manages to vanish from view just as the phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST, taking out several of the Borg drones.
</DIRECTION>

The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch, causing Worf to duck for a moment.

Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a BORG HAND bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm. It's a test of strength. Worf reaches over with his other arm, hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED, SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks.

Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS the BORG QUEEN.

She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen -- a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty- pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and mechanical.

With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself down to where her face is very close to that of Data's. Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked "X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the door and steps inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut that door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals, turns around in fury.
</DIRECTION>

	What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?

She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's SKULL. Picard moves to her.

	Yes. I don't have any money right now, but I may be able to get some.

As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed, watching her.

<DIRECTION>
Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty phaser equivalents of machine guns -- big, mean-looking weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons, building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

Worf is in command, directing the action.

Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready for battle.

INT. BRIDGE

Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now completely surrounded Engineering on all sides, including the deck directly above and below. In essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the rest of the ship.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ENGINEERING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before. Worf and the security team in their positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering through the walls and ceiling of an old house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of the room and travel to the other. There's an overpowering sense of creatures just outside those walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack Starfleet troops.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

INT. BORG HIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker, Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own voice... bits and pieces of his life...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more human."
</DIRECTION>
<BORG_QUEEN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORG_QUEEN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg operating table... his right arm and shoulder are encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL, obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the room, carrying out various tasks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's been a change since we've been here last. There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again. We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're definitely creepy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do, he's still immobilized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to- face with the Borg Queen again.
</DIRECTION>
<BORG_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?

</BORG_QUEEN>
<DATA>

<BORG_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORG_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data. She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and moves away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can now see that all of the skin has been removed from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on the top of the mechanical forearm there is something new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little puzzlement.
</DIRECTION>
<BORG_QUEEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what this is, Data?

She smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand straight up in response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before. The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<BORG_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that good for you?

Data can barely describe the sensation. But clearly, it was pleasurable.

EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over from the inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are sitting off the front porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft, feeble light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind, with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back, trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An exhausting day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed behind a supporting beam of one the town's many WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt, revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots... undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off her hips...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This really isn't why he came out here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt... pulls it off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves and helmet attached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a little relieved... keeps watching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit... pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump... makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then turns the spigot...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches, curious about what she's doing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind her. She begins walking toward the windmill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps behind the girder, stays very still in the shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill without a glance and heads into town. After she's gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house has only one room, which functions as a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black, and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo- equipment all around. But the most striking feature of the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid- air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced Ruby to print photos on anything she can find -- bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment, taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There seems to be a theme running through the photographs -- a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes. It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to bloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way it used to look... Ruby with a dog...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that someone is watching him. He turns around to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIMSELF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by the image. She's captured the essence of the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked. Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should pay closer attention to those little red lights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'd be perfectly justified in shooting you right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard glances at the photograph of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say you already have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends from Cornell...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some.

</PICARD>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie. That's one. Keep going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
(considers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard has to come up with something -- decides to throw her off with a high-tech explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or the shielding around the plutonium core will begin to deteriorate. Within a day, the entire silo will become so radioactive that no one will be able to come near it for a hundred years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby eyes him evenly.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie. That's two. One more, and I pull the trigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard is starting to get angry.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not a thief...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're a petty burglar and a liar...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're no friend of Zephram's. He is a great man. He's not like you or me or any of the other zombies walking around this town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He's a man with vision. He can see beyond the problems that surround us. He knows there's a better future out there for everyone... a future where crime, poverty and war are things of the past... a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the stars.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in that future, too, Ruby. I believe in it in every fiber of my being. And I'm telling you... if we don't launch that warp ship tomorrow, there's a very good chance that future will never happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his words have had any effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard glances through them -- his expression tells us the photo he needs is in there.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't regret this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
They share a look... and then Picard turns and walks off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions. Something about that man has touched her...

EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship -- a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with ease and onto the deflector dish...
</DIRECTION>

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this image on the Viewscreen.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.

</WORF>
<TROI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROI>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make sense. The deflector is only used for shielding and long range sensors...

Riker stares at the screen... notices something.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Computer -- magnify grid twenty- one alpha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<DIRECTION>
The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish. They appear top be modifying power conduits in some fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORF>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Computer -- thermal enhancement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<DIRECTION>
The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped coil, which is pulsing.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<WORF>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...

<TROI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...

	What kind of message?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORF>
<RIKER>

	If it was me... I'd say "attack Earth now... in the 21st century... they'll be too strong in the 24th."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<DIRECTION>
They think about this for a moment as they watch the Borg swarming on the deflector array.
</DIRECTION>
<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to stop them from sending that message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORF>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agreed. Options?

<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Destroy the deflector dish.

<TROI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we aim our dorsal phasers at it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROI>
<DIRECTION>
Riker shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've lost control of all weapons systems... Transporters are down... we can't get to a Shuttlecraft... and it would take us too long to fight our way down to deflector control...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKER>
<DIRECTION>
They think.
</DIRECTION>
<WORF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is another way, Commander. Do you remember your zero-G combat training?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORF>
<DIRECTION>
Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.

Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a clear view of the base of the missile engines -- Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle. Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve assembly.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORDI_S_VOICE>

MOVE TO REVEAL we're in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MISSILE SILO - LOWER CATWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk. Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of N.D.s attach the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the ship. The N.D.s are using high-tech welding tools and sparks are flying. As they talk, they head back up the catwalk toward the control room...
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<GEORDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.

INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Geordi and Picard ENTER. Lange is checking out a launch console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to look like the place is up and running. Picard stops near the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Lange -- have you brought the computer systems back on-line yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<LANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, Captain. This trinary language is pretty archaic... but I think I understand it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANGE>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

As they speak, CAMERA MOVES in on the metal canister of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MONTONA WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to Picard and Geordi's conversation. Far in the distance, we can see the missile silo.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD_S_VOICE>
<GEORDI_S_VOICE>

	It'll be tight, but we should make it.

	What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.

	Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.

Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it sounds like Picard is planning an invasion!

INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I'd better start familiarizing myself with the flight controls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
A console BUZZES. Lange moves to it, and activates a small color video MONITOR. It shows an external view of the MISSILE silo, just outside the hatch. Beverly can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious Zephram Cochrane.

CLOSE ON COCHRANE'S FACE

<DIRECTION>
A short time later. His head is bandaged, and he's conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. He sits back, looking a little overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight... you're from the future... I'm about to change history... and all I have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship?

Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a corner of the Control Room.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>

	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
He studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He smiles a little ruefully.
</DIRECTION>
<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And people say I'm crazy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCHRANE>
<DIRECTION>
Picard smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assure you, Doctor, that after today... no one will ever call you that again.

Cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.

<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just do me a favor... bring my ship back in one piece.

</COCHRANE>
<PICARD>

<GEORDI>

	Doctor... my name is Geordi La Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I shake your hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORDI>

Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They shake hands.

	I wish I could go with you. Is there anything I can do to help?

Geordi smiles...

PICARD AND BEVERLY
</DIRECTION>

have moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops down into a chair. Mid-conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You actually performed surgery...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<BEVERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...

She looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of the medkit -- a surgical transporter.
</DIRECTION>
<BEVERLY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: device)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.

<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did Doctor Almack react to that?

	That might not be so bad... at least for you.

She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's attitude, she's simply making an observation about someone she cares about.
</DIRECTION>
<BEVERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw the way you looker at her... and I know that look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEVERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's a pointless conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<BEVERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want some advice? Don't do this again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know exactly what I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEVERLY>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<BEVERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEVERLY>
<DIRECTION>
She holds his look for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
(neutral)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a ship to launch.

Picard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go... wondering whether her words had any affect...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump. The plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid -- silver halide. She caps the jug, picks it up, begins walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a moment... looks out over the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates... then frowns and goes inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks up. Only a few feet away is the large picture of Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want to think about him... but there he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances back at the open door... struggles for a moment... then makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head. With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and heads for the door...

</BORG_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color, fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking. Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his face tentatively, his expression confused... but intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<DATA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DATA>
<DIRECTION>
The Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now free, but he is still restrained on the table. The rest of his body is still android, mechanical.

<DIRECTION>
Data touches his two hands together, feeling the sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.

It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen watches, pleased. She hovers close to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BORG_QUEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until today... your emotions were trapped inside an artificial shell. You didn't know what it was to truly feel.

But his words have a certain hollow quality to them. He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek.

	You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.

She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain. Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling.

are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of metal to get to them, making then easy targets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the dish and flying through the vacuum of space like paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too many targets to defend from above and below. One of the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing the man instantly. Worf FIRES a phaser blast into the Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck, grappling with each other.

EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BORG HIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably, Warp stars streaking by.

Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be seen in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They smile. It's a moment of victory.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's begin the landing procedure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO BAY/BORG HIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies, leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a shocking image: all of his human flesh has been STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him before -- raw and mechanistic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data rolls over... still locked around him is the MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the very top of the spine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a flat, mechanical voice.
</DIRECTION>
<BORG_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
(fritzed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Data...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORG_QUEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal spinal column just below the brain stem... and SNAPS IT IN TWO. The blinking brain stem FRITZES OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop... twitch... the blinkies on their bodies GO OUT... and they both FALL OVER DEAD. Their connection to their Queen severed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFFERIES TUBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Borg Drone reacts... lights out... slumps over DEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BORG HIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen. He leans back a little, as though exhausted by his remarkable experience. CAMERA PULLS BACK, emphasizing the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched from the launch. Scrimm and his militia guards are sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other Starfleet N.D. keep a watchful eye on them. Cochrane is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him over. Ruby is pacing, lost in thought...
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't anyone going to say welcome back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD_S_VOICE>

standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant.
</DIRECTION>
<BEVERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Picard nods. Beverly, Lange and the N.D. look relieved. Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard.

</COCHRANE>
<DIRECTION>
Geordi smiles and walks over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD AND RUBY
</DIRECTION>

stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes locked. They drink in sight of each other... there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words. She smiles... he smiles back. A satisfying moment.

<DIRECTION>
Townspeople along the Main Street. A sense of urgency -- something's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it appears the Vulcan ship has detected the warp signature and is now on its way to Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly something in the night sky catches their attention. A BRIGHT LIGHT is moving down towards the city. We now realize this is what people are reacting to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the massive VULCAN SCOUT SHIP SETTLING down onto the ground. Dust flying everywhere. Windmill blades spinning wildly from the exhaust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TOWNSPEOPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's happening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - ON A HILLTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A good distance away, but with a good view of the entire scene. Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship LANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram Cochrane watching the landing. People from town are surging around them. Everyone is shocked and amazed at what they're seeing. Picard watches with satisfaction -- this is the moment he's been waiting for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VULCAN SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
settles, engines whining down... dust settling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves to Cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Cochrane... this is your moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple with the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God... they're really from another world?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCHRANE>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. And they're going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>

Cochrane looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's supposed to be me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCHRANE>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zephram, you had the vision to build that ship when no one else on this planet could see beyond their own problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You flew that ship... all I did was push a few buttons.

Cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath, nods...
</DIRECTION>
<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't worry -- I'll keep your secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCHRANE>
<DIRECTION>
They hear a mechanical WHIRR and a HISS of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople behind them react with shock and fear... a few people take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man alone about to change the course of human history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around him... and he puts his arm around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HILLTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment... they glance at each other with excitement as they watch history unfold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VULCAN SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the hatch swings completely open... light streams out into the night air... and THREE HOODED, ROBED FIGURES EMERGE. They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment frozen in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TOWNSPEOPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching in awe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD AND RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LEAD VULCAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his race. He steps forward to greet Cochrane... raises his hand as if to wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave in return...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic Vulcan greeting.
</DIRECTION>
<VULCAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Live Long and Prosper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VULCAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign...but can't quite do the awkward finger-split.
</DIRECTION>
<COCHRANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCHRANE>
<DIRECTION>
The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. The very first Alien-Human relationship is underway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD AND RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the scene unfold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HILLTOP

<DIRECTION>
Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile, Riker taps his combadge.

</RIKER>
<DIRECTION>
The crew DEMATERIALIZES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD AND RUBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying attention to them. The bright lights from the Vulcan ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. Picard turns to Ruby. It's the moment he's been dreading. This is goodbye. She looks at him.

A long, difficult moment... then he lets her go... turns and starts walking off into the night. She stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her eyes...

Picard hits his combadge.
