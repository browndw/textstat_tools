:SC: The Cable Guy
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote control. The hand changes channels frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception. Unfortunately for him – his cable is not hooked up.

	Jesus, where's the cable guy already?

INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just moved in. The phone rings.

	Hello.

</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the move going?

Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horrible. The cable guy is missing in action. Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't called Robin have you? Please tell me you didn't call her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STEVEN>

(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm giving her space.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe she's doing this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never should have asked her to marry you. You're the mad smotherer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All she had to do was say no. She didn't have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forced her to evaluate the relationship. If you didn't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk about it. So what time are you going to come by?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I'm working double shifts the rest of the week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my first night here. Don't do this to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other camera guy pulled out his back. Besides, I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch. Isn't that enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie channels for free. Even the dirty ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff. What if he says no? I'll feel like an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of them say no, believe me. I'll talk to you later.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable to fill his day without cable.

He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his tension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOORBELL RINGS

(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh great.

</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.

</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CABLE GUY is walking away.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>

</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look who decided to show up. I was just gonna go collect my retirement pension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were supposed to be here four hours ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed. CABLE GUY
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to leave) Maybe I shouldn't have come at all – jerk off! (turns back smiling) I'm just joking. Let's do this. (looks around) Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?

<DIRECTION>
They walk into Steven's living room.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a comment card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please mail it in when I am done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These go to your boss?

	No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss... perfectioniss...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	perfectioniss...t. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me baby. Tell me where you like it. That's it baby.

He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your sweet spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your lady kicked you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really don't want to talk about it with you. Could you please just install my cable? I'm going to get dressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sweat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Steven walks toward his bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time.
	</DIALOGUE>

The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.

CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKKI_KLIEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKKI_KLIEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<RIKKI_KLIEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called "The Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of "Twin Envy."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIKKI_KLIEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(jumps to his feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up. Is that cool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
(non-confrontational)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You programmed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off of Steven's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let me slave your remotes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So after this I'll only need one remote for everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you're pretty good at this. You could be a cable guy yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he finishes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let me check your levels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. That about does it. I just have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven does.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That gave me power of attorney over you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm about finished here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I feel good about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Cable Guy walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(turns back immediately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... uh... I have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(deadly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean illegal cable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you that? I want his name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're offering me a bribe? What you have just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... that was dumb. I was just making conversation –

He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, great. How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge you. Your girl just booted you. Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is so nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands him a card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is my personal beeper number. It's just for my preferred customers. Never call the company, they'll just put you on hold.

	Maybe some day I'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works. It's really incredible.

	Sure. We should do that one day.

	No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty. On the flip side.

Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.

	The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing.

INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine." Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has written.

Steven peeks his head in her door.

	I love you, but I need to take some time on my own to see how I feel. You agreed to this. I mean... this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<STEVE>

	What? Now we're broken up? What happened to 'trial separation?'

INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.

Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never stopping for more than a second.

He hears a horn honking outside.

Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV - The local news.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming up next a special report, "Loneliness, America's Silent Killer."

<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van drives onto the main boulevard.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming out. You know most people think cable is just a simple co-ax that comes out of the wall. They never take the time to understand how it works.

	Where exactly are we goin?

EXT. CITY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...It all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics, created the first cable television system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, overlooking the entire city.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.

EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK

Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I come here to think sometimes. To clear my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's controls are located.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There she is. Right now she's sending entertainment and information to millions of satisfied citizens.

The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(with wonder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities.
	</DIALOGUE>

The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.

	Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess I've always taken it for granted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a kid my mom worked nights. Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean. My dad was there, but he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always out of town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(moved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's tough. You must have a lot of abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right?
	</DIALOGUE>

The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind.

The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're pretty love struck about your lady, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and she asked me to move out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said she felt pressured. Can you believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I don't think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is. All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. That is remarkably insightful.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Robin loves that movie.

	Maybe I will.

Steven gets out of the car.

</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just remember right now. You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I guess we're the lucky ones.

INT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't listen to you. I pretend to understand but I'm really just saying what I think you want to hear. So from now on I'm going to try my best to listen more because I do love you and am interested in learning about every detail about the complicated splendor that is you.

Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, are you doing anything tomorrow?

</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>

</911_OPERATOR>
<SAM_SWEET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun four times. I mean I think it was a shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I think it was an Asian gang or something. They were speaking some other language.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_SWEET>
<DIRECTION>
Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.

Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, here, here.
	</DIALOGUE>

A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.

</RICK>
<STEVEN>

	Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There is no stopping me today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd run the court for a couple of innings.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm skins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is scary.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>

The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes.

</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.

	All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it.

Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court.

Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And down low.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven gives him a low five just so he can leave.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>

INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.
</DIRECTION>

	Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to it, thought it might have been you. All right, bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the rest of the calls.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(fast forwards)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We're having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here. You're it!

	I guess you're too busy to call your friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(Revision Ends - Blue)

Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then –
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(ON THE MACHINE) (long beat - then quiet and distant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed casually, but looks beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in. What do you think of the place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the odd placement of furniture.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made some interesting choices laying out the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>

INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</STEVEN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's Hal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice to see you doing so well.

	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<ROBIN>

</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. We really should see it now. Now's a good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, wait. I know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials it, then presses the number in.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll just page him. We'll have this fixed in no time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing –
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was... fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a problem with your service?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... my cable went out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Steven pushes him out into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you called me. Interesting how you call when you need something. Is that how you treat people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been really busy. You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here. This is really important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back out.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But calling me back isn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I help you? I gave you free cable. What have you ever done for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything you want. Name it – quickly.

He makes a motion which implies sex.

The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.

Steven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scene from the film "Sleepless in Seattle."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van – alone. We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we can tell that he lives there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(SCENE 29 OMITTED)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>

Steven opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which says "MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT."
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>

The Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc.

Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the cable Guy, annoyed.

The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his shield.

The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, watch it!

</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just like when Spock had to fight Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced to do battle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All right. If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough.

<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, sending him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar weapon, and then begin to circle each other.

<DIRECTION>
He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek Battle Music" as they fight.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't 'Star Trek!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection. STEVEN (looking down) Jesus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The show's host runs up to Steven.
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>

	Get on the god damn horse! I don't think he's kidding!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOST>
<DIRECTION>
Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy. STEVEN Don't do this! CABLE GUY Jim, we have no choice! STEVEN Oh my god.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick. The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet. STEVEN (concerned) Are you okay?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him. CABLE GUY Well done good sir. You are the victor, but we shall meet again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms in triumph, and smiles. DISSOLVE TO LATER: INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT They are walking up the stairs. CABLE GUY You've got a real warrior's instinct. STEVEN I've got to admit there's a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick. CABLE GUY If Robin saw you tonight, she would be begging you to take her back. I'm telling you these knights get laid all the time. STEVEN We should go again next week. CABLE GUY Easy there Lancelot.

Steven opens the door to his apartment. INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine. MACHINE You have zero messages.

Steven walks to the living room. 36AA INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Steven turns on the lights. CABLE GUY What do you think?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line. STEVEN What is this? CABLE GUY I took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system. I got you the big screen, plus THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants. STEVEN You went in my house when I wasn't home? CABLE GUY How else was I supposed to get the stuff in here? Magic? STEVEN How much did this cost? CABLE GUY Practically nothing. I have a connection. Preferred customer. I hook him up, he hooks me up. STEVEN Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't feel right. CABLE GUY Yes but you give me something so much more valuable... friendship. STEVEN And you've given me friendship, so we're even. (beat) Really, don't take it personally, but you've got to take it back. CABLE GUY (sadly) Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck works all week. Is it all right if I leave it here till Saturday? STEVEN (guilty) Sure, no problem. And don't get me wrong. I really appreciate the gesture. CABLE GUY Mm-hmm. (beat) Staple gun? STEVEN Oh, right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven picks up the staple gun. The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch. Steven drops the staple gun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it. INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads "HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY." STEVEN (into the phone) Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work. Call me.

Steven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone. STEVEN Hey, I had the best time the other night. When am I going to get you on my couch again?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - DAY The Cable Guy is driving around. He speaks on a cellular phone. CABLE GUY Well tonight's not looking too good. How about tomorrow? STEVEN Chip? CABLE GUY I knew I'd get you on the phone that way. Listen, that equipment will be history the day after tomorrow. It sure would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin. STEVEN What do you mean? CABLE GUY Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a few butts. Later gator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SATURDAY NIGHT CLOSE UP - AN OLD MAN'S FACE INTENSELY SINGING "AMERICAN WOMAN." We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room. It is populated with about twenty odd looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very uncomfortable. 37AA INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Steven is on the phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the fridge. STEVEN Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my message?
</DIRECTION>

STEVEN Sorry. I've been trying to reach you 'cause I'm having a party. You've got to come over. ROBIN (listens for a beat) I can't. I'm going to dinner with someone. STEVEN Dinner? What, like a date? ROBIN Not really a date. STEVEN You've got a date?! I thought things were going well between us. ROBIN They are. STEVEN So why are you going out on a date? ROBIN I made it before we got together the other night. I knew you would freak out. STEVEN I'm not freaking out. ROBIN Yes, you are freaking out. STEVEN I'm not. I just can't believe you would do this. ROBIN I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed to date. It's not like we're back together. We had a good time the other night, and you're already pressuring me. STEVEN (pissy) Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun. ROBIN I will. STEVEN Fine. Bye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer. CABLE GUY This is just a sign that you need to live a little. She's having fun, and you should too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEVEN You're probably right. CABLE GUY Damn right I'm right. STEVEN Oh, I got you a little something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands a box to the Cable Guy. CABLE GUY I thought you said we were even. You're breaking the rules. STEVEN So shoot me.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it. The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days." The Cable Guy is so moved he cannot speak. STEVEN My brother said it might help with your lisp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard. CABLE GUY Words cannot express... (he is too moved to finish his sentence) STEVEN It's no big deal. CABLE GUY Yes it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable. CABLE GUY Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be the best party ever! Let's rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS They walk into the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing "Superfreak." Everyone's having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd. (Revision Ends - Blue) STEVEN You've got plenty of friends. CABLE GUY These people are acquaintances. They're not ride to the airport friends, like us. (sees something) Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A real barn burner. Don't look. STEVEN You're playing with me again. CABLE GUY No sirree Steven. This woman is all over you like a lamp-shade. STEVEN Shut up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back. CABLE GUY Did it just get hotter in here? (grabs his crotch) Oh, that hurts. STEVEN Who'd she come with? CABLE GUY I don't know, but she looks pretty available to me. I'd strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates, masturbates, know what I'm saying?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather. CABLE GUY Look at him. Have you ever seen him so alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got to learn to live with that. RICK I don't know what your story is "Chip Douglas," but I'm going to find out. CABLE GUY Oooh. How dramatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him. RICK I'm getting out of here. STEVEN (drunk) Why? This is a great party. This girl is really into me. RICK You're whacked man. That guy is bad news. STEVEN You don't even know him. You're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball. RICK I can't even deal. I'm outta here.

POLICE OFFICER #2 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Do you understand?

We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. Apparently it has broken down.

The Cable Guy touches his nose.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let your memories of these cute twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation comedy killed his own brother in cold blood, then called the police and said he was killed by an Asian gang. There was no laugh-track on that night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP HE SLOWLY WAKES UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We reveal that it is the Cable Guy.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks back another time and the Cable Guy is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>

He puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven, you're just like me. We're cut from the same cloth. We're one and the same!

The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his face. He never acknowledges it.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't think you're right for Robin. She needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs. Someone who understands her soul.

</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears the Cable Guy scuttle away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it.

Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door.

As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).

He looks to the dish, but cannot see her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled with several feet of rain water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the center of where those wires meet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me Steven!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven! Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(mimics her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah Steven. Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly, like a girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've missed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and speaks right into his face.
</DIRECTION>

He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in this position?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would have thunk it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have knocked his jaw out of alignment.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(without any lisp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna have to do better than that Steven.

<DIRECTION>
(realizing his lisp is gone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Steven runs to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance several times.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.

<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what your saying. Who does this guy think he is, Jason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of the Rich and Famous." He still looks terrific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the race is on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(knows he's about to fall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is such an anti-climactic way to end this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his demise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too. You're right. We shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll work them out together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(between coughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What just happened? Where am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(remembers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays him on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Robin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it on Sly Stallone in "Rocky Three." He should wake up in thirty seconds, so let's get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do anything stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! This is not like anything! This is not a movie! We're real people! You're hurting us! This is reality!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of Robin. She runs to Steven's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this is reality...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he climbs onto the guard railing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I am outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this. You just need help. We all get lonely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I get really lonely.

(a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven, I think I sat too close to the television. Mommy was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABLE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto his hand at the last possible second.
</DIRECTION>
<CABLE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late for me, but there's a lot of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby- sitter.
	</DIALOGUE>
