EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark- skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised for the next pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZÚCAR/SUGAR - 19, lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES the ball toward the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball slams inside.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike three!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93 MPH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and kicks the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is friendly and playful as players tease each other across the tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty pounds in two months; now he's going for twenty more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCOS>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(mouth full of food)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All muscle, baby. Rock solid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE uniforms by their BLACK "tryout" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their last. One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<PEDRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDRO>
<DIRECTION>
A few of the guys LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Pedro)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you hustled half as much as him, maybe you'd be hungry too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
The other guys "ohhhh" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel exchange subtle grins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - SAME DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated English instructor, SEÑOR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>

CLOSE ON Miguel, repeating the strange words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECREATION ROOM - SAME NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec room down a hall, and into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WEIGHT ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in thought. TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer, then leans back onto the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK OUT as he lifts the bar, and begins a set of presses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kansas City Director of Minor League Operations, RUDY HUBBARD (white, 40s), watches a TRYOUT SESSION, where TWO SKINNY TEENS in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers. Their AGENT talks on a cell phone nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids, whispers in his ear. The kid smiles tentatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you tell him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him to grip the ball more gently. Like a tit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
They both crack up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE TRYOUT MOUND. The kid looks over to the two men pow- wowing about him. He breathes in, nervous...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATTING CAGE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedro, sweating hard, takes a few cuts, but only seems to be hitting weak ground balls and foul tips.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pedro Berroa. Third year. Hasn't developed like we hoped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much he sign for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. These kids keep getting more expensive. How much did you sign for back in the day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	3000. When I was fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy smiles and moves on. Alvarez follows. Pedro watches the men as they walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULL PEN MOUNDS - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alvarez and Rudy approach a PITCHING COACH instructing Salvador. Miguel warms up next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Salvador Torres. Been practicing with the team for almost a week. Still raw, but he's got a lot of potential.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gonna sign him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon. Soon. We want to play it low- key, see what his agent says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've gotten two offers from other clubs. Agent says they were around a hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy raises his eyebrows.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
(firm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy looks over to Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miguel Santos. Great arm. We signed him two years ago for fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel fires in a pitch. Rudy nods, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good deal. He throw any junk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks over, sees the American with Alvarez.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show us your curve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods, nervous, focuses. He pitches. The ball curves very subtly over the plate for a strike.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. Mind if I try something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks back to the men.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kid, do you mind? May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel stares blankly at Rudy, not understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him the ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel hands Rudy the ball, and Rudy demonstrates how to handle a knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the index finger tucked against the baseball.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spike curve. Gives you more rotation, more movement.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands Miguel the ball)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel struggles to emulate Rudy's grip, so Rudy maneuvers his fingers into the correct position. Alvarez laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ALVAREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vamos! Let's go! Pitch it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALVAREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks over to his catcher, Jose. Winds up the next pitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy and Alvarez laugh. Miguel looks back over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, son, these things take time. You'll figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy pats Miguel on the back and walks off with Alvarez. Miguel stares at them hard as they go. He turns back to his catcher, determined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation. Delivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Misses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather around, some laughing, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air, landing centered in Jose's mitt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sr. Sanchez stands in front of a chalkboard, reading off lines of a scripted ENGLISH DIALOGUE for the class to repeat. The class' version of the words are jumbled and incomprehensible.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to talk to you.

</SANCHEZ>
<CLASS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASEBALL ACADEMY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel walks down a dirt road with his duffel bag. He exits past the gate, waving goodbye to the SECURITY GUARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the manicured lawns and landscaped gardens of the Academy, Miguel passes through the overgrown, undeveloped land where neighborhood CHILDREN play among grazing goats. He continues down the dirt road towards a paved highway in the distance, as bachata music fuels the sound track, and carries over the following...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVING BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thick stalks of sugarcane race through the frame. CLOSE ON Miguel staring out the bus window. On his way home, he passes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--half-clothed children flying a homemade kite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a truck of bananas barrelling by with a boy perched on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--an old man sitting by the street, looking straight at Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--flaming sugarcane alongside the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--three children wedged between their parents on a motorbike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the tall, wheezing smokestack of the Cristobal Colon sugar refinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel hops off the bus with his duffel, climbs the pedestrian walkway passing over dozens of rusty railroad cars used for transporting sugarcane to the refinery. We PAN Miguel across the bridge, revealing burning smokestacks in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Modest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. A skinny pig roams a barren lot. A group of WOMEN with their hair in curlers sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos to Miguel, who smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Local KIDS play stickball in a trash-strewn clearing with makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard. They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block, SHOUTING his name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl, ERICA (15), buying water from a delivery truck. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. The kids grab the balls, then run off to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel approaches Erica. She puts down her water bucket, gives Miguel a hug.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, sis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any news about the States?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all you have to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel helps Erica with the water bucket and walks with her towards their home - a small wooden construction with peeling paint and a rusted aluminum roof. On the lot next to their house, the cinder-block frame of their future home dwarfs the others on the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel and Erica enter the house, where their brother LUIS (7) watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the middle of the tiny, dilapidated home. The reception is still crappy, though.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel's grandmother, ABUELA, sits upright on her mattress in the corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Abuela. You're looking beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug. Erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up my people? How's the TV?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<LUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erica won't let me watch baseball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUIS>
<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not during American Idol, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICA>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel's mother, CARMEN (late 30s) emerges from behind a hanging bed sheet, which acts as a "wall" separating two rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buenas, Miguelito! Do you have any good news for your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact, yes.

</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to the United States?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet, ma... But I learned how to throw a knuckle curve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A knuckle curve? What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<DIRECTION>
A GROUP of KIDS gather at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<KIDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar, come out and play!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIDS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gathered under the only functioning street lamp, Miguel rears back and throws in a swooping curve, that causes the BATTER to flinch out of the way, as it breaks perfectly over the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carmen, Luis and the rest of the barrio ONLOOKERS, "oooohh", the impressive curve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel notices a group of GIRLS eyeing him from across the street. His eyes stop on one, SOFIA (17). They exchange grins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel's family - minus Miguel - watches a soap opera. Carmen and Erica are in dialogue with the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS away from the family, out the back window, where the new home is being constructed. We ZOOM IN on the structure covered in plastic tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONSTRUCTION LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst tools, dry cement, a half-finished wooden dining table, and other assorted construction materials, Miguel has sex with Sofia on a work table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONSTRUCTION LOT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel throws on his t-shirt. Sofia looks at the wooden dining table. It's artfully done, with details etched into the legs.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will you finish this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon. It's just hard to find the time.

</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's pretty.

Sofia smiles, kisses Miguel on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the rest of the house? How long till it's done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, another month, maybe two... You know we just did it where Abuela's room is going to be...

</MIGUEL>

EXT. MALECÓN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel, Sofia, JAVIER (Black, 22) JAMIE (Black, 26) and ALEXANDRA (one of Sofia's friends) hang out by the malecón (waterside), drinking rum and dancing to merengue that blasts out the open doors of a nearby car. The mood is festive.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVIER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked her, but she asked me to cut my hair. I thought about it. She was cute, but... I liked my hair more.

	I liked it too, Javi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>

</MIGUEL>
<JAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was time for a new look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVIER>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or a new girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Sofia punches Miguel in the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch it, baby, that's a million-dollar arm you're messing with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right! All hail the golden arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Javier and the girls drunkenly salute Miguel's arm, pretend to dust dirt away, but Jaime doesn't play along. He looks on, a little jealous.
</DIRECTION>
<JAIME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You call that flabby rubberband an arm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAIME>
<JAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh...

</JAVIER>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This flabby rubberband can throw 95. What can yours do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JAIME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I threw 98 in double-A Portland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAIME>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	98? Then why you washing windshields now? I saw you try and bumrush Javy at the stoplight last week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone cracks up laughing, including Jaime, as Miguel grabs Sofia, and leads her in a dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His smile fading, Jaime looks out over the water. Miguel notices this. Hold.

EXT. SAN PEDRO TOWN - MORNING

Various Sunday morning images establishing Miguel's hometown:

EXT. EMPTY LOT FIELD - DAY

A makeshift diamond is overrun with weeds, ditches, stones, and trash for bases. Donkeys graze in the outfield, unphased by the LITTLE KIDS (10-14 years old) playing around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG PITCHER fires in a fastball that BEANS the YOUNG HITTER in the back.

</HECKLER_1>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, Miguel sits beside his old coach, FRANK (early 40s), watching the kids play. One of the local SHOE SHINE BOYS cleans Miguel's shoes with an old toothbrush as Frank cracks open a beer. Frank points out one of the kids on the field.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like this one. Good bat speed. Only twelve years old, out here four, five hours everyday. His mom tells me he's missing school. I say, yeah, but... have you seen his swing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Miguel nods, appreciating the vote of confidence.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>

</FRANK>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the city like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear anything about spring training yet?

</ERICA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd tell me if you knew.

</MIGUEL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel gives a coin to the boy who's been cleaning his shoes before heading off with his little brother.

<REYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of you are thinking about your families right now. Your girlfriends, sisters and brothers, grandparents. You're feeling the pressure. But, I'm going to tell you something very important, gentlemen... forget it. You've got to think about yourselves. Put all your energy into your game, into your development as a player. Forget about everything else in your life... and just play ball. You wanna succeed, you gotta be like a racehorse, focused on your goal. It's up to you.

Miguel awaits his turn, watching another pitcher, EDDY, run to first to receive a throw from second base, but before Eddy can catch the ball...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he twists his ankle tripping over the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coaches rush over to Eddy, who is on the ground wincing in pain. Miguel and the rest of the team watch in nervous anticipation as Eddy struggles to his feet, limps off the field with the aid of another player.
</DIRECTION>
<REYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next up, Miguel! Here we go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYES>
<DIRECTION>
The ball is hit on the ground to first base, where the fielder quickly throws it over to second. Miguel charges over to first, stutter steps as he nears the base, and receives the throw just in time to beat the hitter and step out of the way. He exhales in relief.
</DIRECTION>

<SALVADOR>

	Hey, Sugar! They made me an offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles, but hesitates for a beat as Pedro walks past them and over to an empty table in the corner of the room. Miguel turns back to Salvador, pats him on the head.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SALVADOR>

</DIRECTION>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, why do they call you Sugar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's like this... it started cause I'm sweet with the ladies. But mostly it's cause I got the sweetest knuckle curve in the whole Republic.

</MIGUEL>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDRO>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward silence. The players look at Pedro with pity, unsure how to respond. After a beat, Miguel mocks coach Reyes and the others follow suit, mocking Alvarez and the other coaches.

BLAH! Miguel throws up on the mound. All the players gasp in disgust, but Reyes just laughs.

</REYES>

Miguel tries to shake off the cobwebs, steps on the rubber, stares down the next hitter.

<MARCOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Alfonso was there too--

So, you better pull it together quick...

	Go on, I'll be out in a minute. And tell Fernando to keep his dirty hands off my girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Through cracks in the tarp, Miguel watches Erica join the dance party in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Savoring this rare moment alone, he breathes deep, blows wood dust off the table leg, and continues sanding. Hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks out the window over the dry, Arizona desert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A duffel bag emerges from the luggage shoot, and slides down to the rotating conveyor belt, where an AMERICAN TOURIST grabs it and exits frame. PAN OVER to Miguel, Marcos and several other DOMINICAN PLAYERS (including ANTONIO and JULIO) excitedly waiting for their bags. Miguel perks up upon seeing his, quickly snatches it off the belt. The others smile and APPLAUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Dominican players goof off, while Miguel stares out the windows at the rocky suburban Phoenix landscape. He catches wide-eyed glimpses of wacky shaped cacti, strip malls, and, of course, a drive-thru Starbucks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE RADIO, a conservative talk show host warns listeners about the evils of Iran, suggests war as the only solution.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players enter the southwest-style lobby, examining potted cacti, and framed R.C. Gorman reprints on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel and Marcos enter the room, drop their bags and explore everything like big kids away from home for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcos turns on the TV, which has a clear reception. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BATHROOM Miguel examines the hair dryer on the wall, turns it on and off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Miguel opens the adjoining suite door to find Antonio and Julio. They push past him, each holding a beer.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<DIRECTION>
Antonio opens their mini bar, tosses Miguel and Marcos beers. They all toast...
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL_MARCOS_ANTONIO_JULIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To America!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL_MARCOS_ANTONIO_JULIO>
<DIRECTION>
Marcos randomly hits buttons on the remote control and accidentally selects an adult pay-per-view movie. The opening credits plunge right into a graphic sex-scene. Their heads immediately jerk over to the TV, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To America!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCOS>
<DIRECTION>
They all smile and toast again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

Marcos opens the door to find JORGE RAMIREZ (25, an experienced minor leaguer who left the KC Knights Dominican camp three years ago) smiling before him.

Through the window we see the players sitting in a corner booth. A semi truck BLASTS through the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALL NIGHT DINER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over beers, the players study their menus in confusion, as Jorge does his best to explain how things work.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, never, never, drink from the hotel mini bar. That shit is expensive. You want beer, buy it at the store. You wanta see titties? They got magazines for that. Don't pay in the hotel.

A WAITRESS approaches.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The players stare at Jorge, a little intimidated.

After a beat, the players respond in unison...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPRING TRAINING FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, we look down over the multiple-field spring training complex, where the MINOR LEAGUERS work out. The vast facilities are triple the size of what we saw in the Dominican Republic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD, Miguel, Marcos, and Jorge stretch out on the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge, wearing an elastic knee brace, points out a young, AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY running wind sprints across the field...
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad Johnson. He just signed for a million dollars out of college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel and Marcos watch Brad with fascination, searching for some sort of physical representation of his wealth.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a lot of guys like that. But you can't let that intimidate you. Everyone knows Dominicans rule the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Two Venezuelan players, ORLANDO MATO (23, catcher) and ED POVEDA (22, center field) step up.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this about Dominicans ruling the game?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLANDO>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he must've said Venezuelans.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jorge stands up, exchanges hugs with Orlando and Ed as they continue their debate over which Latin country has the best players.

</ORLANDO>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
They all smile, stop razzing each other momentarily to meet the new players.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Miguel and Marcos. Up from Boca Chica.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miguel and Marcos)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orlando and Ed. We all played in Bridgetown together before I moved up to Double A and left these fools behind.

<ORLANDO>

They all LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitching coach, STU SUTTON (white, 40s), addresses the minor league pitching staff in mid-speech.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've gotta show us your best game here. Remember that, until you reach the top, there's always guys above you, hustling to keep you here. And guys below you pushing to take your job. We have 75 pitchers in this camp competing for less than 50 positions come April 3rd. So you gotta work hard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
While all the players respectfully listen to Stu, it is clear that very few of the Latino players can understand him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER ON THE PRACTICE MOUNDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel stretches his arm, while observing another group of PITCHERS throwing in the bullpen. He stares at them with intensity, sizing up his new competition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER ON THE FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel faces off against a HITTER in a simulated game scenario. One, two, three, he strikes him out on three straight pitches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu and another COACH exchange impressed looks.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring over Leonard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
The other Coach calls over to the adjoining field.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring over Leonard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACH>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON major league all-star ROB LEONARD in the batter's box, awaiting Miguel's pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel takes a deep breath, psyches himself up. He puts everything he has into a hearty fastball, which...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...sails right over the plate for a STRIKE, as Leonard calmly watches and readies himself for the next one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling confident with his stuff, Miguel fires in the next pitch, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! Leonard sails it over the right field wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu Sutton smiles at Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to America, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. ALL NIGHT DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a plate of french toast. Miguel, Marcos, Antonio, and Julio all chow down on french toast again. They eat in silence for a few beats, until...
</DIRECTION>
<ANTONIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to admit... I'm getting a little sick of the french toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIO>
<DIRECTION>
The others nod in agreement, but continue eating.

</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Different how?

</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not like me. Of course not... But they're pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat. Sofia looks down at her bare feet, scrunches her toes.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you.

</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you, too.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Marcos tries to sleep, while Miguel channel surfs through the late night infomercials and reality TV dating shows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few beats of this...
</DIRECTION>
<MARCOS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCOS>
<DIRECTION>
And he does.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPRING TRAINING FIELD - GAME DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kansas City B-squad is facing off against the Los Angeles B- squad, which is rallying in the top of the 9th.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BULLPEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel warms up, glancing over to the action on the field between pitches. He sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Los Angeles gets another hit, scoring another run, so...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Stu Sutton walks out to the mound, signals for Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel throws one more warm-up toss and sprints onto the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel arrives, ready for action. Stu hands him the ball, while the catcher, Orlando, translates.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax. Know your pitches. And take it easy. Ground ball. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax. Ground ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods. As he tosses a few more warm-up pitches from the mound, Stu goes back to the DUGOUT where Marcos and Julio anxiously await Miguel's spring training game debut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BATTER steps in and Miguel steps on the rubber, touches his father's cross around his neck, tucks it in his jersey. He looks to Orlando, and nods at his request for a fastball. He throws it in...
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Stu exchanges impressed glances with another COACH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sends in the next one, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the HITTER checks his swing, but goes too far.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUGOUT Marcos gets to his feet, clapping for encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods to Orlando, delivers again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! The ball is smoked toward Brad Johnson at second base. He leaps out, body fully extended, and makes a fantastic catch. But he's not done yet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The runner at second is too far off the bag, so Brad hops to his feet, and fires a laser beam to second, finishing off one of the sweetest double-plays you'll ever see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel pumps his fist into the air, and the team runs to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DUGOUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcos and Julio are the first to greet Miguel with high-fives. Orlando, Ed, and Jorge, coming off the field, follow in suit. Miguel awaits Brad's return to the dugout and high-fives him too, but they soon return to their segregated places on opposite ends of the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUBHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the players are gone or heading out when Miguel approaches his catcher, Orlando, a few lockers away.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel agrees, as an ASSISTANT COACH finishes handing out checks to the remaining players.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sits on the bench near his locker, opens his envelope to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: a check for $502.18.

He SMILES.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR goes over baseball related vocabulary off- screen, while Miguel glances through his "English for Baseball Players" notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds a page with pictures of different foods along with their English names. He looks at all the foods, stops at an image of a fried egg. He circles the word "egg."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The instructor finishes up class, and the exhausted Latino players get up to leave. Marcos stands, leans over to Miguel.

She nods, looks out over the landscape, and for the first time we see...

</DIRECTION>

We STAY ON Miguel for the game's highlights, JUMP CUTTING his reactions to the best plays of the game.
</DIRECTION>

PLAY 1: he casually spits sunflower seed shells, then CLAPS the final out of the inning, high-fiving players returning to the dugout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 2: chats to Jorge, when they react to the CRACK of the bat, leap to their feet, eagerly anticipate an umpire's call, and CHEER when the call goes their team's way.

<DIRECTION>
PLAY 3: grimaces at the sight of a hit-by-pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 4: leaps to his feet, CLAPS.

<DIRECTION>
PLAY 6: Miguel and Jorge sway to the seventh inning stretch classic "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 8: standing with Jorge and the rest of the players, the mood is tense. The players react to a hit ball, as their heads jerk toward the outfield, waiting, waiting, waiting, and...

CELEBRATION! Whatever happened, the game is over and we follow the players out onto the field to mob Brad, who just scored the winning run.

Some of the Swing players celebrate their first victory with beers at the local bar/dance club. A few of the guys dance with LOCAL GIRLS, but Jorge and Miguel stand against the wall, beers in hand, as they watch the MTV-inspired GRINDING and FREAKING unfolding before them.

INT. BIG MUDDY'S DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge whispers in one of the girls' ears and the two of them begin dancing with him and Miguel. At first cautious, Miguel and his partner ease closer, until Miguel's hands are on her hips, leading her in rhythm to the hip-hop jam, while mixing in some Latin moves as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork. But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in particular, who...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKASS>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKASS>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other, though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything serious starts. They all hustle out to...

They all pile into Brad's car, as a few locals stand near the club's entrance, watching them go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls up near the house and Miguel stumbles out, as the wild bunch inside HOOT and HOLLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out with the hum of the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins' bedroom where Helen's silhouetted figure lingers in the window. He tiptoes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in, and carries over to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the exception of Miguel, the all-white congregation sings hymns about Jesus and the Lord. He tries to suppress a yawn when he sees Anne Higgins singing in the choir. She notices him as she sings. A smile.

Miguel perks up.

She stops a random CHURCHGOER...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I borrow a pen real quick?

</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
The churchgoer hands over a pen, and Anne writes her address on Miguel's forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the game. My house... Good luck, tonight.

</ANNE>

Anne runs off. Miguel looks after her, mystified.

INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey head under one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses himself. Play ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first pitch high for a ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to the field in choice box seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch. Ball two. Same for the third. And forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Jefferies does his thing on the mic.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. Hailing all the way from the Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the club with his power during Spring Training. But he's off to a rocky start tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we played back home. That's all it is. Just a game, man. So relax. Let's have some fun. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods. Jorge points out the next batter. Another Dominican.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? Just like home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge runs back to his position at third. Miguel tucks his index finger into his knuckle curve grip. Delivers...
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! There it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
And the next pitch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...is hit sharply to Jorge at third, who fires it over to second for one, and on to first for a double play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes WILD and Miguel finally exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One, two, three... he mows down the next BATTER on three consecutive strikes. More APPLAUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUGOUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Orlando hands him his first strikeout ball. Miguel takes a seat, wipes the sweat from his head, then looks down at Anne's address scribbled on his forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOREBOARD - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN RIGHT across six innings of zeroes. The Swing are leading 4 to nothing in the top of the 7th.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWACK! The HITTER smokes a double off the left-center wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nearly unhittable for the first 6 innings, that was only the second hit allowed by Santos tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE FIELD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next BATTER dribbles a spinning groundball at Jorge, but it squirts through his legs into left field, allowing the runner to score an unearned run from second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu walks toward the mound, signals for the bullpen. He and Orlando greet Miguel on the mound.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good game, kid. Enjoy this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>

</MIGUEL>
<ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy; it's your first game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Though he doesn't speak Spanish, Stu knows exactly what's happening. He takes the ball from Miguel with a smile, but Miguel doesn't move, still reluctant to leave the mound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the FANS begin to cheer his stellar debut...
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear that? It's for you, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
Orlando smiles, pats Miguel on the butt, and Miguel finally starts his slow walk off the field. As we follow him off, the FANS rise to their feet and Miguel approaches the dugout to a standing ovation. On his way in, he's greeted by his teammates with congratulatory high-fives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THIRD Jorge stares at the dirt, frustrated by his misplay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALLPARK - AFTER THE GAME
</DIRECTION>

FIREWORKS EXPLODE in the sky as the kids in the crowd watch excitedly.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel and a few other players hang over the railing, enjoying the awesome display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANNE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel rings the doorbell, waits. He's holding a baseball. Anne opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Miguel. C'mon inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the ball like it's a rose.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some kind of casual teenage party is in effect. Pizza boxes are spread around the living room and everyone (12-15 WHITE KIDS) are drinking soda from plastic cups. No booze.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey everybody, this is Miguel. He's from the Dominican Republic, and now he pitches for the Swing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone manages to say "Hi Miguel" at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GAME ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two guys, RANDY and TRAVIS, play a spirited game of foozeball, while Miguel looks on, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<TRAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIGUEL>
<TRAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like soccer. You play soccer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAVIS>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soccer? No. Baseball.

</MIGUEL>
<TRAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well this is called fooze-ball. Fooze- ball.

</TRAVIS>
<MIGUEL>

</MIGUEL>
<TRAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks for Anne, sees her going over some papers with another kid. She sees Miguel, waves, then gets back to her conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be a pitcher. In little league. I wasn't very good though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods, and another girl, WENDY, chimes in.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard that the beaches in the Dominican Republic are really beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods again. They stand in silence for an awkward beat, sipping from their red, plastic cups, until...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey guys, let's get started. Everyone grab a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
The teens crowd into the living room, squeezing together on sofas, recliners, and desk chairs. Miguel sits behind the majority of the group, not sure what's going on. Anne stands before them...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad you all came. Last year, we didn't have half as many people in our group. So, I think this just goes to show the great work we've been doing in spreading the word. But this year, I want us to work harder. Now, I know a lot of you are studying for SATs or working on college applications. And all of that is important, but we need to remember that our spiritual accomplishments are more important. What we do in school or for a job... that's just a small part of who we are. We're only here by the grace of God, so let's get out there and share that grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel watches, still unsure what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>

Anne leads the group in song, while Randy plays the piano. Miguel watches; he's the only person not singing.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GROUP>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One there is above all others, Oh, how He loves! His is love beyond a brother's, Oh, how He loves! Earthly friends may fail or leave us, One day soothe, the next day grieve us; But this Friend will ne'er deceive us: Oh, how He loves!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GROUP>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel observes, a little disappointed, as this is not quite the date he was hoping for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. MOVING BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Miguel and Brad are side by side in neighboring aisle seats, while Jorge and Jeff catch some Zs against the window. Miguel's "English for Baseball Players" workbook is on his lap, but he and Brad discuss language that won't likely be found there...

Brad senses Miguel's disappointment in the matter.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sweat, bro. We'll find you a little honey on the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles. Brad picks up his mp3 player, searches the menu for something.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like The White Stripes?

Miguel grabs his portable CD player, hands it to Brad, trading music with him. As Miguel places Brad's Bose headphones over his ears, The White Stripes' "Seven Nation Army" infuses the soundtrack and leads us through the following...

MOTEL HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

FUN CITY BOWLING ALLEY

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Jorge sleeps, Miguel carves a small piece of wood with a swiss army knife. Stops when he hears a burst of MALE AND FEMALE VOICES coming from down the hall. He, goes to the door, listens...

When he's done, he goes to his duffel, pulls out his English language workbook.

Miguel sits on his bed, opens the book.

A batter swings and misses for strike three. The catcher throws the ball around the horn.

Miguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction, gets the ball back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line, where the first baseman makes a nice back-handed play...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUCH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the RUNNER storms into Miguel before he has time to pull his foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground. The runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet.
</DIRECTION>

Stu and the TRAINER run out to check on him. Jorge rushes over from third, and Orlando also comes to help translate.

The umpire grants Miguel a few "test" pitches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Visibly shaken, Miguel sets up for a warm-up pitch, breathes deeply, and delivers. He lands gingerly on his right ankle, makes a face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, kid. Give it a rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>

As Stu reaches for the ball, Miguel pulls it away.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am okay. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>

Stu and the trainer sense Miguel's anxiety. Stu puts his arm on Miguel's shoulder for comfort.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're okay, I know, but let's just be sure... Give me the ball, son.
	</DIALOGUE>

Anne nudges her dad under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Miguel, honey. I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods, takes a bite of potatoes. There is an awkward beat as everybody chews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel musters all his language skills to break the awkward silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Michael and Hilary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have other child...?
	</DIALOGUE>

</HILARY>
<ANNE>

EXT. ANNE'S PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel and Anne sit alone on the porch. We can hear CHATTER from inside, where the others are clearing the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like it here in Iowa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I like... Many new things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks for a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet. You've traveled a long way, huh? God must have something special in mind for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Anne points out a small scar on Miguel's scalp.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... When I boy... Um... I don't know--

</MIGUEL>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me in Spanish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish, no subtitles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... When I was little, I wanted to eat some cherries from a tree. It wasn't our tree, and there was a fence to keep us kids away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Anne hangs on his every word as if she understood perfectly.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I climbed up the fence to knock down some cherries with a stick, but I when I took my first swing-- whoosh. I fell. There was a lot of blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Anne reaches out, lightly touches his scar. Her hand lingers for a beat, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Miguel leans in and kisses her. She kisses him back for a beat, but when he puts his hand around her waist, pulling her closer, she resists. They separate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne looks down at her feet, uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I just... Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks on, confused, as she stands. They lock eyes for an awkward beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should help clean up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
On her way back inside...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have another meeting Thursday... If you can come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods. Anne leaves him on the porch alone. He looks out over the corn fields.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel enters the near-empty room limping on his blue boot, finds Jorge wearing street clothes and packing up personal things from his locker. Miguel knows immediately what's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They make eye contact from across the locker room. Nobody moves. After a beat...
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a good run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?

</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the drill. I'm not playing well, so they'll bring up somebody who is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about your knee? You just need some more time... You're recovering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>

Miguel relents.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want me to fly back tonight.

<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not going back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Miguel lets this sink in.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta cousin in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to New York?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where else? There's no work back home. My bonus won't last forever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks off. Jorge senses his anxiety.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax Sugar, I'll see you at Yankee Stadium someday... when the Knights come to town. I'll be in the front row, getting drunk, and cheering the loudest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for you though. Yankee fans are crazy. I can't take the risk... I'll call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Miguel looks at Jorge with concern. Jorge shakes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You worry too much, Sugar. I'll be okay. I mean, it's just a game, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods.
</DIRECTION>

INT. SOFIA'S HOUSE (DOMINICAN REPUBLIC) - NIGHT

Sofia on the phone. We INTERCUT between her and Miguel IN HIS BEDROOM, his injured ankle elevated on a pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you play tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>

	Good, good.

</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding. I mean I would, but none of these white girls speak Spanish. Marcos plays in Arizona. Lots of Mexicans; everyone speaks Spanish. He has like fifteen girlfriends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>

	Jorge went to New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the Yankees?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Our team cut him loose. He's got a cousin there... I don't know what he's going to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit... What about his family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(his mind somewhere else)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not right. He got injured playing for them. They owe him another chance. He's worked too hard for too long... I mean he's not a horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel drifts off, and they sit in silence for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SOFIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can't let it get to you. You've got nothing to worry about. Just keep playing well, and things will be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOFIA>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I know. Things will be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>

Miguel looks off, not so sure.
</DIRECTION>

Players lounge in uniform, relaxing before tonight's game. Brad reads on the sofa across from Miguel, who is in his street clothes, his crutch by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>

<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You study at, um, university?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Little. Secondaria?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High school?

</BRAD>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. A little of... high school. But I sign when I have sixteen years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You signed at sixteen? Wow. So you didn't finish school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel shakes his head, no. After a beat...
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you no play baseball... what you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... it's hard to say for sure, but I like history, so I'd probably go to grad school... maybe teach someday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad! We're up for B.P. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Brad gets up, taps Miguel on the shoulder on his way out. Miguel sits alone on the couch in the empty room, when he looks off, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BATHROOM doorway-- Jeff Elks discreetly hands ANOTHER PLAYER a prescription pill bottle, exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel takes note of the transaction, leans back, looks at the ceiling fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel watches "When the Levees Broke" playing on HBO-Latino.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV, one image of the hurricane's devastation gives way to another. An AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN stranded on the roof of her house. A YOUNG BOY who's lost his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks on, moved by the tragedy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASHER/DRYER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel takes the initiative and attempts to do his own laundry while on the disabled list.
</DIRECTION>

He stuffs his clothes into the washer, scrutinizes the instructions, turns the knobs, and presses the buttons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Miguel studies his English Language workbook on the couch. He glances at the wall clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>

As Miguel opens the faulty utensils drawer, the folded paper towel holding it in place pops out. Miguel catches the drawer from slipping too far, takes out a fork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sits at the kitchen table with the broken drawer and several small tools in front of him. He readjusts the wooden rails on the faulty side of the drawer by sanding them down and re-gluing them into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT DOOR. Miguel hobbles over, opens it to find Anne, carrying a casserole dish and a couple empty platters.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are grandma's from the other night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel lets her pass into the kitchen, put the dishes on the table. They stand awkwardly for a beat, looking at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We missed you at our meeting, Thursday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, maybe next time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go actually, so--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sits, gets back to work on the drawer. Anne looks at him for a second, then exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel glances out the window, watches Anne climb into a pickup truck idling in the driveway. Anne and Miguel make brief eye contact before the truck speeds away, a trail of dust following it into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORN FIELDS - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel walks down a path in the middle of the Higgins' corn field. He finds a cob of corn, removes the leaves, and examines the kernels up close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZOOM IN to ECU of a single kernel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel stares at the raw corn with strange fascination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel walks in without crutches, looking healthy. He pounds a few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu approaches Miguel...
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was an injury to the Wichita right-fielder. They called up Brad this morning... He left you this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
Stu hands Miguel an old paperback book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: a Spanish-language version of Roberto Clemente's biography. Miguel opens to the first page, where Brad has inscribed a note, "See you in Kansas City, Mamañema!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles, bittersweet, when a familiar VOICE calls out...
</DIRECTION>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo! Sugar!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel turns around to find Salvador Torres (the once scrawny kid from the Academy) running at him. They hug.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit! How'd you get here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On a airplane, motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel playfully flips Salvador's cap bill down over his face for being a smartass.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, you guys know each other. Sal's our new middle-relief man. Throws a nasty cutter. You could learn a thing or two from him, Santos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stu walks back towards the coaches' office.

<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it... Good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you, too, Sugar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<MIGUEL>

EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUNNER circles the bases after hitting a homerun.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Santos allows his second homerun of the game. First night off the DL, and not looking so sharp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
The SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel glances out of the corner of his eye to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DUGOUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Stu is scribbling on his scorecard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIGUEL quickly sets up for his next pitch, but Stu is on his way out to the mound. Miguel glances back to the bullpen, where Salvador is warming up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu signals for Salvador to come in, and we follow Miguel off the field to scattered applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RADIO BOOTH Jack Jefferies continues his play-by-play of the game.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sutton makes the call to pull Santos here in the 4th, bringing in rookie reliever, Salvador Torres for his Bridgetown debut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUGOUT. Miguel sits on the bench, throws a towel over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND. Salvador warms up, looking a little freaked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Players and fans marvel over Sal's unorthodox, side-armed delivery. His form is reminiscent of A's legend, Dennis Eckersly, but without the grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIGUEL peaks through his towel at the action...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD. Salvador takes a deep breath, delivers his first pitch...
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Salvador seems to relax. Winds up his next pitch, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the ball appears to zig-zag across the plate, freezing the hitter in confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike two!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
MIGUEL can't watch, hides behind the towel again. SLOW ZOOM IN on Miguel's head, hidden.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike THREE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel removes the towel, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...SALVADOR smiling big as he comes off the field. Orlando pats him on the back, hands him his first professional strikeout ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RADIO BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A stellar debut for Torres, who records the final out, baffling Josh Lansford with a nasty side-armed cutter.

<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just do me a favor... don't give it away to the first white girl you meet.

</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Salvador laughs, but Miguel is serious. He gets up and heads for the showers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGGINS CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen and Earl drive Miguel home after the game. ON THE CAR RADIO, we can hear a news report of a suicide bombing in Iraq. Helen turns it down.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You started dropping your arm in the third. I think that was your problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He lost control of his breaking pitches and they just zeroed in on the fastball, which isn't as fast as it used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<EARL>

</EARL>

Miguel stares out the window in the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. MOVING BUS - DUSK

Miguel runs videotape behind homeplate as Salvador strikes a batter out.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VISITORS' CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel storms into the empty clubhouse, grabs a bat from the wall rack, and smashes a water dispenser unit to the ground, spilling water everywhere. As he observes the mess, his breathing steadies, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances over to the entrance, where the clubhouse manager stares at him, disapproving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VISITING COACHES' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sits across from Stu, staring off, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's hard when you don't perform up to your own expectations for yourself. But you need to learn self- control. Can you understand what I'm saying? You need to learn that your actions have consequences. So we're gonna take the cost of the water unit you broke out of your next check... That's not something your family back home's gonna be too proud of... Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel turns his gaze to Stu. Though he doesn't fully understand what he's saying, Stu's intention is clear.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you should think real hard next time. Think about channeling that frustration you're feeling onto the field. Into practice. Channel it into working harder--
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I am work hard! Everyday I work hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>

</MIGUEL>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you may think I don't know what you're going through, but I do. I've been on the mound; I've played through pain. I've been in your exact situation before. I've struggled too... I've...

As Miguel glances away in frustration, Stu stops himself. They sit in silence. Hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEORIA CHIEFS' PARK - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pouring rain. The few remaining FANS head for the exits. The players pack up their gear in their respective dugouts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW ZOOM IN on MIGUEL, staring at the falling rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON about ten pills in Miguel's palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff Elks instructs Miguel, alone, in the small room with a flickering fluorescent light.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, your first time, take a half. Okay? No more. You gotta ease into it. Half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyone finds these, you didn't get them from me, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Before Miguel can respond, Salvador enters with his dirty laundry. Miguel hides the pills.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, Sal?

Jeff heads out. Miguel resumes folding his clothes.

<SALVADOR>

</SALVADOR>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIGUEL>

Salvador examines his detergent options from the dispenser machine.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one do you use?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel eyes the bleach. Can't help himself.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

</SALVADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Salvador inserts coins into the machine, pulls the bleach lever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE BATHROOM STALL - THE NEXT EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel pops two pills. Exits out into the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWING CLUBHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...where Salvador undresses out of his bleach-stained street clothes. Miguel walks past without acknowledging him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA eerily floats toward and around Miguel on the mound. He stares down the HITTER, totally focused. He touches his cross, whispers a prayer to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winds up, throws, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the old days. Miguel's "stuff" is back. And he knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE STANDS. Earl and Helen settle into their box seats eating caramel corn and cola.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RADIO ANNOUNCERS BOOTH. Jack Jefferies at the mic...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miguel Santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. I don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the Santos we knew earlier this season.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUGOUT. There's an intensity we haven't seen before in Miguel. We get the sense he's treating this game like it could be his last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND - 2ND INNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIGUEL. Sweating more than he should at this point in the game, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...who cares? He continues to dominate opposing hitters, striking out two more in the 2nd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE STANDS. Earl and Helen CHEER for their Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUGOUT - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still sweating, Miguel is now shifting his jaw back-and-forth. The SOUND FADES LOW, as he stares onto the field, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in subtle SLOW-MOTION (36 fps).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu approaches Miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. We see him mouth the words, "You okay?", but NO SOUND comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods, yes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE FIELD - 5TH INNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And back in real time (24 fps). Miguel fires his first pitch over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop. Orlando motions for him to calm down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next pitch is closer, but still high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart is racing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RADIO BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top of the fifth and Santos is showing some control issues. Not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND, Orlando runs out to Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<ORLANDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it. You're all good. Just relax. Throw strikes. They can't touch you. Just throw strikes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORLANDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods. Orlando goes back behind the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel glances to the runner at first, then delivers...
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Orlando nods, encouraging. Throws the ball back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel takes another deep breath. He whispers a prayer to himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...his next pitch is ROCKED to deep left field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. We HOLD on his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STU shakes his head in disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE BULLPEN, Salvador watches, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE STANDS, Earl and Helen clap for encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIGUEL does his best to shake it off, but he keeps muttering to himself, which makes him look crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another deep breath. Another pitch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UH-OH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This one almost finds the batter's head, as he falls to the dirt to avoid contact. It's on.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(ejecting Miguel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're outta here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
The batter leaps to his feet, walks out toward the mound, pointing his finger at Miguel, PISSED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel opens his arms, inviting a fight. Orlando steps between them.
</DIRECTION>
<BATTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking Puerto Rican piece of shit!

<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, cocksucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Both benches clear, as players rush out onto the field to restore order.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel and the batter continue jawing at each other, while the other players swirl around them, creating little sub-conflicts of their own. It's a mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound FADES TO SILENCE and the image blends to SLO-MO again. There's something poetic about a bunch of men in child-like baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself... Hold, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE SHOWERS - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel showers alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGGINS KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel eats a late dinner at the table. Earl sits at the other end, sipping some tea, while Helen does dishes at the sink. The mood is uncomfortably tense. Nobody says a word, until Miguel musters up the courage.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Helen turns off the faucet, turns around. Earl methodically sets down his mug, stands up, and crosses to Miguel. Puts his arm around his shoulder, wherein...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Miguel breaks down, hugs Earl around the waist, his face pressed against his stomach. He's crying. Hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - COACHES' OFFICE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stu addresses Miguel before the game. Though his words are encouraging, his tone is detached, cold. Miguel senses this, listens, dejected.
</DIRECTION>
<STU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You played with your emotions, and your emotions got the best of you. Happens to everyone. It's just a nasty part of the game. Nobody likes to admit it, but it is. The true test of our character as athletes... is how we come back. It's up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STU>
<DIRECTION>
Stu notices Hardy, the Swing mascot, pass by his office door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, um, anyway, I'm bumping Sal into your slot in the rotation. I'd like to see how you handle a relief spot.
	</DIALOGUE>

ON THE MOUND, Salvador fires in the opening pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RADIO BOOTH, Jack Jefferies does his play by play.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_JEFFERIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moving up from relief, Torres makes his third start for the Swing. I tell ya, this lanky kid from the Dominican Republic has surprised us all with his unique delivery and precision. Reminds me of a young Pedro Martinez... Hey there Bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. So pick yours up at the box office today...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_JEFFERIES>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BULLPEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Similar to an earlier sequence of JUMPCUTS on Miguel reacting to the game from the dugout, we now HOLD on Miguel, solemn and detached, from the bullpen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: the frame for the following images contains the first 3-4 rows of FANS seated behind the bullpen, so we can also use them to gauge what might be happening on the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 1: Miguel, the FOUR RELIEVERS, and the fans clap for a nice play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 2: The fans jump to their feet as a ground ball passes through frame, followed by an outfielder in hot pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 3: A reliever warms up in the foreground. Miguel stares ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 4: A new reliever warms up, then runs out onto the field, leaving only two others with Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 5: Miguel stares ahead, while the crowd does the "Chicken Dance" behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 6: The fans leap to their feet in applause. The two relievers high-five. Miguel CLAPS, going through the motions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 7: Miguel chews and spits sunflower seed shells as the fans sing along to "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 8: Another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only Miguel and one other guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAY 9: Miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the fans leap to their feet, CHEERING victoriously. Game over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out onto the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the players and fans head for the exits, Miguel remains on the bullpen mound for a beat. He nods to himself, oddly at peace with the moment. Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN with him, as he crosses frame, and makes the long walk to the dugout. Hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel grabs a slip of paper from his nightstand. His large duffel bag is packed full in front of him. On the wall, his NYC calendar is turned to AUGUST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the phone. Dials...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat he hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>

Helen walks in to find Miguel washing the dishes in the sink.

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thank you, Miguel.

Helen grabs a dish towel. They do the dishes together in silence. After a beat...
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Helen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Helen smiles, pats Miguel on the back. HOLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl drops off Miguel near the team bus, as players and coaches load their gear in, and get on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel cautiously approaches the bus, sees Salvador, hesitates...
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot something in the clubhouse. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
As Miguel turns, Salvador grabs his bag, which is still on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVADOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, I'll load your bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVADOR>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel grips his bag tighter and the two of them lock eyes. Salvador senses his intensity, releases the bag. Miguel backs away with Salvador looking on.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's he going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<SALVADOR>

<DIRECTION>
AT THE CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE Miguel turns back to the bus, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Salvador eyeing him from the open bus window. Sal raises his hand, very subtly waves goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel continues on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURLINGTON BUS DEPOT - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A local taxi pulls up, and Miguel hops out with his duffel bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots her a cautious smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVING BUS - DAY/EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel stares, wide-eyed, out the window at the shifting landscapes, daytime into evening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--cornstalks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--bridges and rivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--city lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sleeps against the window, his Clemente book open on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVING BUS- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the New Jersey turnpike, Miguel sees the approaching Manhattan skyline in the early morning light. He sits up straight, looks attentively at the city emerging in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles. His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a Metrocard vending machine nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches and BEEPS, he's got his card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TURNSTILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile won't budge. He studies the message: "SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS TURNSTILE", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again, this time very slowly, but still can't get through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Miguel strolls through the underground hallway that connects the various Times Square subway lines, he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a TEAM OF BREAKDANCERS performing for tips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--billboard ads for movies, music, dermatologists, Mets baseball, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a HOMELESS MAN passed out on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a WOMAN selling a random collection of objects: VHS tapes, batteries, a used blender...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MOVING
</DIRECTION>

Miguel observes other passengers, when the train emerges above ground. He stands, looks out the window as the train passes Yankee Stadium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 167TH ST. - THE BRONX - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel descends from the elevated subway station, glances around. The atmosphere is immediately more familiar, as PEOPLE walk by speaking Spanish; MERENGUE blasts out of an open apartment window; Dominican flags hang from others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel paces up the block, looking for something. He smiles when he finds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...El Restaurante Caribe. A HELP WANTED sign (in English and Spanish) hangs in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EL RESTAURANTE CARIBE - DAY

Miguel takes a seat at the counter, smiles to the waitress, REYNA (cute, 20-something, Dominican).

<DIRECTION>
EXT. (ANOTHER) STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel continues to follow the elevated subway tracks, which lead him straight to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...YANKEE STADIUM. He looks up at the park's grand exterior with wonder. Approaches to get a closer look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a glimpse of the field through an iron fence. He grabs hold of the bars, attempts to climb just enough to get a better view, but...

	Two hundred now.

INT. PARADISE HOTEL HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

INT. PARADISE HOTEL ROOM
</DIRECTION>

Miguel strolls by various stores and restaurants. He passes outside a WOODEN CABINET STORE, where 5-6 Dominican men, ranging in age from 20 to 50 years old, make furniture in the shop. He stops for a beat, watching the men work.

INSERT: Various employment ads, requiring experience, fluency in English, working papers, etc.

INT. WOODEN CABINET SHOP - EARLY EVENING

Two EMPLOYEES say goodbye to Osvaldo as Miguel enters the shop. Miguel approaches Osvaldo, who is sanding a table.

	Hi, um, do you remember me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but, sorry, I still don't have a job for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. I already found one. I'm actually just trying to make a coffee table, and I'd like to buy some wood and supplies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't really sell raw materials...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just moved here, you know, and I don't have a space to work. Do you think I could do some work for you, help you clean up or whatever you need, in exchange for using your shop? You don't have to pay me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Osvaldo sizes up Miguel's unusual request.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody paying you for the table?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's a gift for my mom. Something I like to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you?

</OSVALDO>

<OSVALDO>

</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Osvaldo nods, understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole world plays baseball. My son's sixteen. Won't touch a piece of wood that's not a bat. I never cared for the game, myself. Too slow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mom still in San Pedro?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. With my sister and brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're telling me that you want to make a table for your mom, then mail it back to her in the Dominican?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel nods. Osvaldo smiles, finally warming up.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>

INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel leans against the counter, staring at his clothes twirling in the dryer, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he notices Raquel unloading her clothes a few dryers away. She pushes her laundry cart to the opposite side of his counter, begins folding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel stares at her out of the corner of his eye, taking special notice of her diverse underwear collection ranging from lacy thongs to the standard cotton variety. She catches him peeking.
</DIRECTION>
<RAQUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(with a mysterious Eastern- European accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just going to watch or you going to help me out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAQUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Caught off guard, Miguel smiles awkwardly, turns away. After a few beats, a flying sock lands on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to find several random items of her clothing on the counter in front of him. She smiles, keeps folding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel sorts through the items: socks, underwear, t-shirts. He looks back to her, then begins folding, as the laundromat's machinery reverberates around them. They exchange brief grins.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<RAQUEL>

INT. CABINET STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel carves wood, while Osvaldo looks on from his desk. They exchange glances, until Miguel breaks the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you never liked baseball? Not even as a kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>

</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so special about Clemente?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read this book where he said something like, "If you have the opportunity to help someone and don't, then you're wasting your life." And he was a carpenter too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For real. He used to make furniture during the off season.

</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you fucking with me? Cause you know I can google this fool right now.

A beat. Miguel continues his work.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you get released?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't release me. I left a few days before the season ended.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left? When was this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>

<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit. Where are you staying?

</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>

	Oh, you know, with a friend. But if you know somebody who needs a roommate...

Osvaldo nods and they continue working.

<OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel hesitates, unsure where to begin. Osvaldo senses his discomfort with the question.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any family here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm okay... I have some money saved, a couple friends. I'll go home to visit soon.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to sleep, Miguel lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, when he overhears a commotion from across the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, he hears a door open and SLAM SHUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the door, listens close. It's quiet, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel flinches. Then slowly cracks open the door to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Raquel standing before him with a small leather duffel bag.
</DIRECTION>
<RAQUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him the bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love, keep this in your room for me. Just a few hours. Til morning. I'll be back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAQUEL>
<DIRECTION>
She forces the bag into his hands, kisses him on the cheek, and retreats into her own room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel closes the door, still holding the bag. He sets it on his bed, stares at it. After a few beats, he grabs it, stuffs it under the bed, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down at the desk, stares at the bed, when he hears SHOUTING from the hall. Again, he goes to the door, listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another MAN POUNDS on Raquel's door, SCREAMING in Ukrainian, while Nikolai YELLS at the man in English, though Miguel can't make out exactly what's going on. The shouting intensifies until a SCUFFLE breaks out. A woman SCREAMS. Miguel reaches for the door handle, but stops himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps into his BATHROOM, shuts the door, sits on the toilet. The muffled SHOUTING continues. Miguel waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIGUEL'S ROOM - LATER

A beat, as Miguel drifts off.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can talk to Alvarez... But I don't know. Nobody's happy about this.

<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>

</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel doesn't respond. Osvaldo notices his packed bag and worn expression. Both men stare at each other for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Jorge eats at the counter, while Miguel stands on the opposite side, in his apron.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called the Higgins to give my new number, but they said you split. I couldn't believe it, man, I had no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things got a little ugly after you left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all go through slumps you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a slump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, but I wasn't gonna wait around for them to throw me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge looks at Miguel for a tense beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever, man, you wouldn't be saying that shit if you made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles, shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNA>
<DIRECTION>
(from across the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sugar! Rafi needs you in the kitchen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNA>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They call you Sugar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
On his way to the kitchen...
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I say? The name sticks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
As Miguel slips past Reyna on his way to the kitchen, they exchange flirtatious smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPTOWN CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merengue fuels the packed club tonight, as the mostly Latino crowd gets down on the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR. Miguel, Reyna, Jorge, and his girlfriend, MONICA, drink beers, enjoying the party.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got all kinds in this league, bro. Like fat cats in their forties, kids like you and me, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, even some white boys. I got this fifty year old catcher on my team, used to play for the Dodgers. Can't run for shit, but he's out there every week. Belly out to here. My man can still go deep though... You ever hear from that kid, Brad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Reyna leans close to Miguel, says something in his ear, and he smiles, as she leads him out onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DANCEFLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...where they carve up some fast and fierce moves. Miguel grins wide, having a great time. At this point the sound FADES LOW and the image blends to SLOW-MOTION, their bodies gliding through the frame, soothing and peaceful. Hold, as Jeff Buckley's "Hallelujah" FADES UP and carries over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EL CARIBE RESTAURANT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DELIVERY MAN puts boxes on a ramp, which go from his truck down into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EL CARIBE RESTAURANT BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel takes the boxes off the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EL CARIBE RESTAURANT - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTERN UNION - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Miguel hands the teller two fifty dollar bills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel floats down the street among a packed block of Bronx pedestrians. He blends in now, just another face in the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOODEN CABINET SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osvaldo helps Miguel work on his coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WOODEN CABINET SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Osvaldo teaches Miguel how to use the internet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OSVALDO'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel, Osvaldo, and his wife, ESTELLA, eat dinner at the table. The music continues under the following scene...
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did some research and I got a new favorite player now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vic Power. You know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel shakes his head, no.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican first baseman ever. But that's not why he's my favorite player... Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas. So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English. Didn't even notice the "whites only" sign hanging in the window. And Vic was Black. I looked him up on Google. I mean Black like you. So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people."
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella eagerly await what comes next.
</DIRECTION>
<OSVALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, "That's okay, I don't eat colored people."
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSVALDO>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure. Osvaldo does his best to explain the joke in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OSVALDO'S APARTMENT - SPARE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We INTERCUT between Miguel and Carmen in the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits at her table in the same old house. (We can see through the window that the new one is still unfinished).
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got the photos you sent, but you'll have to send more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, mom, but you know it would be a lot easier if you opened an email account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Email? I don't even know how to use the TV!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm making a new table for you. It's going to be real nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I'll love it. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's Erica?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's good. Got a job at the factory. Just part-time, though, so she can keep up with school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel removes the phone from his ear for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Luis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's pitching now. You should see him, Miguel, got an arm like his brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but can he throw a knuckle curve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Carmen laughs. After a beat...
</DIRECTION>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you, mom. But, I'm working hard. I'll be home soon. Give everyone a hug for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, Sugar. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, hangs up, and looks over to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...LITTLE LUIS, watching her from across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROBERTO CLEMENTE FIELD - BRONX - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a Dominican flag being waved by a TODDLER. A WIDER ANGLE reveals him in the packed bleachers with a diverse CROWD of FANS and FRIENDS: Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Anglos...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mood is festive. A VENDOR sells mangos on sticks. Merengue MUSIC blasts from a portable stereo in the stands. FANS drink Presidente beer out of bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uniformed PLAYERS of all ages, races, shapes, and sizes warm up before the game (though the majority are Dominican).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge introduces Miguel (also in uniform) to the other players.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>

<CABALLO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CABALLO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<CABALLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a while, no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABALLO>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FELIPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, Sugar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIPE>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIGUEL>
<GERONIMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was there in 96. I lived on a farm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERONIMO>
<MIGUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the Higgins!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<GERONIMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERONIMO>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel smiles big, just as the UMPIRE calls out...
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vamos! Let's play ball!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOUND - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TILT UP from his cleats to reveal Miguel looking in for the sign from his catcher. He nods. And delivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball is SMACKED toward third, where Jorge makes an awkward lunge for the ball, manages to stop it with his foot. By the time he gets his hand on it, the RUNNER has made it to first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fans and some of the players laugh at Jorge's ugly mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN_HECKLER>
<DIRECTION>
(from the stands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't soccer! You can use your hands!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN_HECKLER>
<MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like old times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIGUEL>
<DIRECTION>
But Jorge shrugs and laughs it off. No pressure here. It's only a game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel buckles down, delivers a monster fastball.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets the ball back, looks to the stands, and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Monica waving to Jorge at third.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel's new friend, Osvaldo, is also there with Estella. Miguel smiles to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel fires in the next pitch, even faster, and the batter swings straight through it.
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike two!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets the ball back, lowers his head and whispers a prayer to himself. Looks back to the runner on second. Comes to the set position, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...floats in a vicious, swooping, knuckle curve, that causes the batter to flinch out of the way, before breaking back over the plate for...
</DIRECTION>
<UMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike three!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UMPIRE>
<DIRECTION>
All the fans and players in attendance go NUTS over the awesome pitch, as we follow Miguel off the field to a mini-standing ovation. He tips his hat to the crowd. Just like old times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DUGOUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel takes a seat as TEAMMATES pass through the frame and pat him on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND FADES LOW as we start a SLOW ZOOM IN on Miguel. He takes in the moment as we get closer, and his smile gives way to a beat of quiet introspection. Hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out across the field. CLAPS for encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
