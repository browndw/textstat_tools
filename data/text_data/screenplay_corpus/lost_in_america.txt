INT. BEDROOM

The bed is the only piece of furniture left. The CAM- ERA STOPS. In front of the bed is a small black-and- white television. In bed are DAVID and NANCY HOWARD. Nancy is rolled over on her side. David is lying on his back with his eyes wide open.

</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It's just time to ask these questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We've sold our house and bought another one. These questions should have been asked before.

	Okay, fine. I can't talk to you. Good night.

	Stop it. You're nervous about tomorrow. You'll get your promotion, don't worry. We'll move into our new house and we'll be happy, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, you should hear yourself. The excitement in your voice just fills the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm tired. Stop questioning. We made a wise decision. Let's try and feel good about it, alright?

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's too close to here. It's going to feel like the same place. Maybe we really didn't think about this long enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thought about it forever. We wanted more space. That house has more space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but the point of a house is not just space. You can rent space. Maybe we should've moved into a completely different neighborhood, a step up or something. Maybe we should've gotten a house with a tennis court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? We don't play tennis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure we don't play tennis. We don't have a court. When you have a court, you learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, possibly some day, we'll have a court and then we can learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you one more question? Why did we let Bekins do all of our packing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that a waste of money? We could've packed ourselves. Maybe we were too irresponsible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you. One minute you want a tennis court, the next minute you're worried about Bekins packing a box? My God. Sometimes I wish we really were irresponsible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Look, get some sleep, okay? You'll feel better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't assume how I'm feeling. What do you mean "nothing"? If you're saying we should be more irresponsible, I imagine you mean we're too responsible? Is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sometimes I think that we are too controlled, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see. Well, tell me something? How do you go out and buy a four-hundred-thousand- dollar house and let a moving company pack everything and get maids and servants and live the good life and not be controlled?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? I'm responsible. I should be guarding the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're insane.

</NANCY>
<DAVID>

	You're right. I am insane. I am insane and I'm responsible. A very, very good combination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

We STAY in the bedroom with Nancy. She lies there. Her eyes are open. She's staring straight ahead. She looks sad. After a moment, David reappears at the door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I apologize, okay? But don't call me names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What names?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what names. Calling me responsible is saying what? That I'm closed up. I'm old. I'm stodgy. That's not fair. I don't like the way things are any more than anybody else does but what am I supposed to do? I'm trying. What about you? You're as responsible as I am. Personnel Director for a department store is not the most irresponsible job in the world. Go hire anyone you want. Think you'd be fired fast if you did that? How much freedom do you have? We're all in the same boat. We're trying to make something of ourselves and it's hard. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very upset. I'm sorry I used that word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm glad you used that word. It's honest but things are going to get better. They're going to change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but this time it's different. After tomorrow I'm no longer an employee, I'm a Vice President. I'll be my own boss. I'll have a piece of the company. You see what I mean? I can be more irresponsible because I'll be in a position of responsibility. That makes sense, doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I guess it does. Good night.

	What can I say? I'd be a liar if I tell you I'm surprised. I do feel it's deserved but yes, I still am flattered... That's very nice. Thank you... Oh, stop, please. I've never been good at taking too many compliments at once... Well, I feel the same way about you.

	I'm sorry. That was my wife... Yes, she has wonderful taste. She's going to choose the whole tile thing herself. Originally, we were going to do it together but it's nice to be able to trust someone, don't you think?... Well, that's very nice. I trust you, too. Hey!...

	Well, that's not my first choice but what's the alternative? And I'm not blaming David. I know he genuinely believes that being made Vice President is going to change things. But he genuinely believed that every promotion would change things. It never does. Maybe for a few days, but that's it. Then things are always the same.

You don't have to pay that money and then be told that there are options? No extras, everything included... Come on! - For thirty- seven thousand, leather is extra?

INT. PAUL DUNN'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL DUNN is one of the heads of the advertising agency. He certainly holds the top position on the West Coast. His office is large. It smells of success. Obviously, this is a man who has made a great deal of money and spent it where people can see it. As David enters, he sees Paul sitting behind his desk and a baldheaded gentleman, BRAD TOOLEY, seated on the couch. Brad Tooley is in his early forties, very well-dressed in the upper Eastern advertising establishment manner. As David comes in, Brad and Paul both get up.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(his hand out- stretched)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, David. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. I'm excited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, I'd like you to meet Brad Tooley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad, it's a pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David and Brad shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad has recently joined the agency in New York. He was one of the best men at Doyle, Dane and Bernbach. We were lucky to get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's exciting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
They all sit down again. David doesn't know quite what to make of the fact that Brad is in this meeting. He just assumes this is part of the ceremony of being made vice president.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, I don't have to tell you what I think of you. You know I feel you're one of the most creative people in this company. I was telling Brad earlier the accounts you've been responsible for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very impressive. The Knudsen Orange Juice campaign was one of the best I've ever seen. Ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles; he's in his glory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad has joined this company for a very special reason. David, we're going to get Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
David, now thinking of himself as the vice president, realizes that Ford is an account of such proportion, that the profit participation could be enormous. His eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God! That's wonderful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it finally puts us at the top of the heap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm stunned. When did this happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just in the last few days. You're really the first to know out here. We didn't want to say anything until it was final.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's wonderful. Just wonderful. God, what a week. What a week for all of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It certainly is. Now, David...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, you don't have to say anything. As the new vice president, I know what this means to the company. I'm here twenty-four hours a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, you're too valuable to become vice president. I'd like you to move to New York and work under Brad. You two are going to be in charge of Ford. You're going to have to hurry, though. You start in three weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
David is not quite sure what he's just heard. He thinks maybe he's heard a compliment. He's heard a name of a city, a car, some weeks, but he hasn't put it together. He needs to hear it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second. You gave me too much information. I'm valuable and I'm vice president?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, David. I've hired Paul Shubano as vice president.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's giving you quite a compliment, David. I asked him for the best man he had and he didn't hesitate for a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't? Well, I don't want to move to New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be the vice president. I want to be a stockholder in this company. It was promised to me. I don't mind working on Ford. Don't get me wrong. I think it would be a joy to work on but I'll work on it as vice president. I've been here eight years, Paul. I don't want to be transferred to just another account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not "just another" account, David.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad, I know it's Ford. I've owned Fords, okay? Now, Paul, I feel it's only fair to keep your promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't promise you anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. What about these lunches that we've been having for the last four years? I believe we talked about grooming me for vice president. Phil Shubano's been here only three years. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, first of all, quite frankly, he's not as clever as you. He's more of an executive type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, great. I think that's wonderful. So, by being extra clever, I get thrown out of the town that I live in, with no promotion, no nothing, and just shifted to another account. He, on the other hand, because of his low intelligence and short time with the company stays here, gets a large amount of stock and becomes vice president. Well, that makes sense!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep referring to this as "another account." It's not. It's Ford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you stop saying that? You sound like Dinah Shore. Now, damn it, look, this isn't fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops for a minute; begins to laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, if I'm working myself up and this is a joke, I'll kill you. Are they going to burst in here and say, "Surprise!"? Goddamnit. You almost had me fooled!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's bursting in here, David. I'm offering you something very big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one's bursting in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Oh God. But, wait a minute, I'm vice president, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop saying no! Just a minute. I can't go to New York. This is my home. My wife and I live here. I just bought a four-hundred thousand dollar house. I'm picking tile out at this very moment. What am I going to do? Burn it down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about that, please? You won't lose a penny on the house. We'll take care of it. I think Ford is more important than a single family dwelling, anyway. We'll get you more than you paid for it. The important thing is that you and Brad get along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and Brad get along? Are you crazy? I've worked here eight years, for what? For me and Brad to get along? I was born in this city. All my friends are here. I like it. We're joking, aren't we? This is a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, a joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, a joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to New York City?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you there in three weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you would?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can be a stepping stone to something bigger, David.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's bigger than being vice president? That's all I want. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I've already stepped on every stone we have here, haven't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, someday you might be vice president.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday? What do you mean? It's today. I've got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who has it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, I can't say this again. Phil Shubano.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, obviously, I'm blocking this man's name, aren't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, I don't know all of your work, but I do know you've got to be the best here or you wouldn't be working with me on this account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brad, shut up! Don't talk! This is my day. Paul, look what you're doing. I've been with this company a very, very long time. I'm one of the oldest employees on this coast, aren't I? Now, I must get what I deserve. I will be made vice president and I will get the stock and I will participate in the ownership of the company and that's that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, I thought you'd be thrilled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought I'd be thrilled? I can't believe it. Why the hell don't you go to New York? If it's so thrilling, come on, I'll take you to the airport. I'll put you on a plane right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to me like that. I came from New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's right and you don't want to go back because as soon as you land at the airport, people steal everything you've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I resent that. That's a cliché. New York's the greatest city there is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down. Just sit down and shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I haven't even started yet. Now listen, let's say a giant mistake was made. Pretend none of this was ever said. I'm the vice president. Everything will be fine. I'll stay here. I'll work on Ford. I'll move into my new house. You and Brad can come over for drinks. And now, let's bring out Allen Funt and everybody will yell, "Surprise," right? I'm vice president, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, the position is filled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then you can go fuck yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BRAD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, I can't work with this man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't either. David, you're fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fired! How dare you? I can't believe this! You want to know something? I was nervous about coming in here today. I said to my friends, "Maybe I won't get this." You know what everyone of them said? "Stop it. You're being stupid. You're the best man. There's no one else. You're the best man." And what does the best man do? He stands next to the groom and watches the groom become vice president!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see you're upset. I'll forget what you said earlier. I don't think you want to jeopardize eight years with this company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. Get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasted my youth for you and for what? What do you mean jeopardize eight years? What eight years? All I did was live for the future. Why didn't you tell me a long time ago that I was too clever? You should have told me five years ago, then I could've gone somewhere else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know it five years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>

Paul stares at him. Brad gets up.

	I'm going back to the hotel. David, you're making a big mistake.

</BRAD>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't even know me, you baldheaded fart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Brad stares at him and then walks out. He turns back to Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe that I almost wasted my entire life here! I've been waiting very, very patiently and I realize now what would've happened. This would've gone on for years and years and years and when I was seventy, I would've gotten a watch. Actually you wouldn't even have given me a watch. You would've told me I was too clever, that I would instinctively know the time. You know something, Paul? I made fun of my friends who dropped out of college and went to "find themselves." I told them they were stupid. I laughed at them. And what did I do? I went with you. Good choice, wasn't it? What did I get for doing that? A transfer. I could've gotten that from a bus. You're a human bus, Jesus Christ! You liar! I don't know where those drop-outs are today, but I've got to find them! I owe them a big apology. 'Cause let me tell you something. They have more integrity on their little tab of acid than you have in your entire body, you big fucking jerk!

A security guard enters.

	Would you escort Mr. Howard out, please?

	He doesn't have to escort me out. I'm honored to leave.

David opens the office door. He begins to yell so everyone can hear him. This is reminiscent of the scene from "Network."
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before I leave, I think it's very important for everyone in this company to know what went on in here today. I don't know how many lunches you've all had with that man and I don't know what he's said over salad or dessert or whatever he buys you, but you better not believe it! He's a real smoothie! He'll tell you about the stepping stones! That's his favorite expression. He'll tell you about the stepping stones and where they lead. Well, I found out where they lead! To a baldheaded fat man in New York! Get out! Get out now! Smell the roses! Smell anything! Just smell! Smell before it's too late!!

David is walking towards the personnel office. We've never seen him like this before. He's alive. He's got more than bounce in his step. It's as if he weighs 12 pounds. He's on another planet. He's smiling at every- body. He has the look of a "Re-born." As he enters the personnel department, he sees Nancy in her office. Because Nancy's office is separated from the others by a thin piece of glass, if you speak too loudly everyone can hear. David is not about to lower his voice. He has no concept anymore of volume. He's just too excited. David bursts in.

I've been on the wrong road. I realize what you meant. I've been too responsible. So responsible, God! I've been responsibly blind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>

	I never would've used the word responsible if I thought you would have taken it so literally. It was just a word. I really didn't mean anything by it.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. Don't do this. Don't. I'm giving you the credit. You did mean it and you were right. I don't know where the hell I've been for the last ten years. What happened to me? I lost the feeling of life. Jesus, I was being jacked off. Nancy, they were just jacking me off!

	Stop it. You like Phil. You don't mean that.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I like him, the under- qualified son-of-a-bitch. Okay, I was harsh. He'll crash the boat. He'll have a serious injury but he'll recover. But forget about Phil! Forget about the vice presidency! That's the past. Nancy, it's time to do it. We're still young. We can change courses. We can do what we should've done years ago, what our smart friends did. We can get out there. We can get out and see this country. We can find out what it's about. We can touch Indians. We can live in the mountains. We can do anything we want to do. And we're still young enough to really explore. So come on, let's go. We're late. I'll wait here. Go quit. Come on. We're leaving.

	There's always going to be people around. That was the problem. We lived for them, not for us. It's okay. There are some people you want to fuck in front of and some people you don't. Maybe you don't want to fuck in front of these people, I don't mind. I'll be outside. You quit. I'll wait!

We'll start finding people who understand what life is all about. We'll find people who are really searching. We'll find people who are willing to take a chance. Look, I'll just get all excited and get into it all again. You go and finish what you have to do and then I'll see you tonight.

David exits. Nancy watches him go. She's expressionless. She doesn't quite know what to make of this. You can sense that part of her thinks that maybe her prayers were answered, maybe this is how the marriage can be saved. You can also sense that part of her isn't sure her husband is sane. Maybe this won't last more than an hour and you can sense the last part of her is still embarrassed that the other employees she works with have heard words like "fuck" and "jacking off." This is a woman of many parts.

INT. THE HOWARD'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Nancy are sitting on the floor. They're surrounded by various maps, atlases and cata- logues that show different pieces of property around the United States, property that most people forget even exist. These places look amazing in their little pictures and, in fact, they might be amazing. It's just that almost no one ever gets there to see them for real. The longer Nancy has a chance to see what her husband is saying, the more excited she becomes.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking in one of the catalogues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this. This is the cutest farmhouse I've ever seen. Twenty- four acres near Darien, Connecticut, five bedrooms, eighty thousand dollars? How could that be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's there. It's not here. We're used to this city. You know what our new house would cost, if it were where this farmhouse was? Not four hundred thousand, maybe sixty thousand if we were lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Nancy is still looking at pages in the catalogue. She stops at one picture. She is fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God. Look at this. A converted lighthouse in Maine, fifty-five thousand, two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a playroom. How do you put this into a lighthouse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe you go to Maine and find out. Or you don't. You do anything you want. Nancy, look at this...

</DAVID>

He opens a piece of paper, showing her the arithmetic he has worked on all afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This seems to make sense to me. You tell me what you think. The one good thing about spending all this time in Los Angeles was that we got a free ride on this bullshit inflation train. Don't ask me how it happened, but we made a hundred and ninety thousand dollar profit by staying in this house for less than five years. Now, that was money we were never going to see 'cause we were about to put it back into another stupid house. Okay. We pull out of that house, we lose our fifteen thousand dollars in Escrow, we take the money from this house, we liquidate everything else we have, cars, stocks, bonds, everything... Nancy, we have two hundred thousand dollars!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We couldn't.

	All we need to buy is a motor home and we should get a great one because we might live there for the rest of our lives, or for five years or ten years or whatever.

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think a motor home costs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess who went motor home shopping? We can get a great one for twenty- five thousand dollars. If there's one thing you can get a deal on it's a motor home. This is the best time in history to drop out. It's a buyer's market!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that would leave us a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. I can't believe it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! On that kind of money we could ramble across the country for years! We can paint, we can explore, we can meet amazing people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if we get to Connecticut and we like one of these farmhouses, we'd have enough money to put a down payment on it, wouldn't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Then if we get sick of that we could sell it and move on.

	I'd like to go to Alaska.

	This is what we talked about when we were nineteen!

<DIRECTION>
A group of men are gathered around David. One of David's friends at work, JIM, is speaking:
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were great. Man, it was great. It was like "Network" and "Take This Job and Shove It," all rolled into one. When you left, we all wanted to go with you. Really. People really had to think for a minute. They were ready to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did anyone else leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I mean after a few minutes, people just went back to work, but for the moment, it was real exciting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, when the time's right, if people want to leave, they will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I believe that. I got to be honest with you, though. I was thinking about my situation and I don't think I have the guts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know that it's guts. It just takes a certain kind of person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, maybe it has nothing to do with guts. 'Cause I think I have guts. I guess I'm not that kind of person. Let's say that I like expensive things and I guess I need my job to get what I like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever makes you happy.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Beauties. What are they? Bally's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JIM>

</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, come on, I'm just playing with you. Listen, I'll tell you something. What you and your wife are doing, well, it's wonderful. Carol and I were driving over here tonight, and talking seriously about breaking the mold ourselves.

</JACK>
<DAVID>

David now realizes that breaking the "mold" has many different meanings to different people.

	La Costa? For a whole weekend, huh? That's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's if I can get away. If not, at least for an afternoon. Just the idea of getting to San Diego, maybe take in Sea World. Anyway, did Nancy tell you what Robinson's plans to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually we haven't talked too much about American business lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there is a rumor and I would appreciate you not telling anyone this, but our store may just be buying up the May Company. This is just the kind of expansion that can make a man like me very, very wealthy.

</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it's good for you, I'm real happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's just say it could make me a million dollars, minimum. But, David, please keep this down. God, I probably shouldn't have said anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, we're not going to be around people who will care. I promise you. I don't think a guide at the Grand Canyon knows or cares too much about the acquisition of a department store in L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a surprise? You want to know about the Grand Canyon and business? The 7-Eleven at the Grand Canyon does more volume business per year than any other 7-Eleven in the country, especially around Muscular Dystrophy time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's good to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it has something to do with the hiking and the tragedy of the children who can't hike. I don't know, but last year they did two million, eight-hundred thousand. Now, of course, there are no other quickie stores around so they have a good one there. A lot of people moving in and out of that canyon. Have you seen these new U-Tote-M stores?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, I don't want to be rude but I can't talk business anymore. I hate to sound "sixties" to you but I'm in a different place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I understand. I remember the sixties. As a matter of fact, the concept of U-Tote-M is a sixties concept. See, the 7-Eleven is a rush-rush place. U-Tote-M is lay-back. Their store in Tarzana this year is going to gross almost...

People laugh.

	When Nancy and I were married we had dreams and plans and I guess in the pursuit of those things, we kind of lost each other. Tomorrow morning, when we leave here, we have no destination. Our only goal is to find out who we really are and what it is that's really out there. We're going to be adventurers in the classic sense of the word, but there is one place that we will stop at first.

	Oh, let's say there was the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa Maria. I'd bet everything I have that Columbus was in the Santa Maria. If the world was flat, I think he'd watch the Pinta and the Nina go. Then he'd tell the Santa Maria to turn around. He'd probably just go back and have sex with the Queen again. I don't think he was a complete schmuck.

</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, we don't want to stay in a Vegas hotel. This is what we've left, this money-grabbing, horrible society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree, but one night? We'll have room service and make love in a big bed and watch porno movies. I think it'll be fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want to touch Indians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will. Just tonight and then that's it. Don't you want to take a bath together in one of those big tubs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you really don't want to, we don't have to. We can camp out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay. As a matter-of-fact, it might be very exciting. We haven't been in a bath together for a long time.

INT. LOBBY OF DESERT INN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Nancy are coming through the main doors. We can see the motor home being driven out of the drive- way by one of the valet parking attendants. David looks behind him and watches the home drive off. He's nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think they know how to drive those things. He could ruin it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
(all excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't worry. They can drive anything. Look. Isn't this wonderful? It's so romantic. God, I used to come here a lot. I kind of miss it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never told me you came here. When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we were married. I'll tell you about it later. Come on.

They approach the front desk. A CLERK is working at one of the reservation computers.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife and I have dropped out of society and we're making this statement, but we want to spend one last night here. We're planning to get up at the crack of dawn and get remarried and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting David, she whispers to him)

	Just ask him for the room.

<DIRECTION>
(to the Clerk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, we're going to get up very early and get remarried so we want something very special because we're doing something special. My point is, we'd like your finest bridal suite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a reservation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I told you, we just dropped out. We don't do reservation things anymore. We're living spontaneously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're not. We thrive on reservations and I'm sorry but the bridal suite is occupied.

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not occupied. I can see it in his face.

</NANCY>
<DAVID>

</DAVID>
<NANCY>

David approaches the desk again. He takes out fifty dollars. He puts it in the Clerk's hand, like he's shaking hands with him.

<DAVID>

	Hello, again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slips him the fifty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor? I've worked with computers. I know what can happen. Sometimes these things get fouled up. Would you check one more time? Maybe the bridal suite was empty and the room next to it was occupied and the computer got mixed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLERK>

(takes a look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean. That can happen sometimes. Let me check.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. It's occupied. These are state-of-the-art computers. Very rarely do we have those kind of mistakes.

</CLERK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure?

<DIRECTION>
Nancy nods yes. David turns back to the Clerk.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I'm not very good at this. I don't get good seats in shows because of this problem. I don't get good tables in restaurants. I've really never been good at this particular kind of exchange of money so, how much do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands him more cash)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go. A hundred. Now, I assume we don't have to continue this computer talk again and say that it's working now and everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The Clerk doesn't even bother to answer. He reaches behind the desk and hands David his key.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you are, eight-twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
He rings for the porter.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, this is the best bridal suite?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heart-shaped bed. Everything. You'll love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much. I'm sure the hundred doesn't apply towards the room at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I was kidding all along.

David and Nancy leave the desk and walk towards the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me we didn't do the right thing, getting out of this horrible society? Jesus Christ, I told the guy we dropped out. Did that make any difference? No. I said we're making a statement. What did he do? Stare at me. I said we're getting remarried. What does he finally say? Give me more money. God! How does a guy like that even live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, think of all the people checking in here. Everyone giving him a hundred dollars, he probably lives well.
	</DIALOGUE>

	No, I meant with himself. How does he... Never mind.

INT. BEDROOM SUITE - DESERT INN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Nancy enter. Apparently, the hundred dollars was not quite enough. This could not be Desert Inn's best bridal suite. This looks like the junior bridal suite, at best. At one end of the room are two twin heart-shaped beds. Above them, there's a mirror, heavily-flocked with gold specks. The rest of the room is decorated in standard red velour. Nancy is disappointed. David is confused. He can't figure out how any manufacturer could make a living turning out twin heart-shaped beds.
</DIRECTION>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go down and get your luggage for you. Where is it?

</PORTER>
<DAVID>

	That's okay. It's locked in our house. I'll get it later. Thank you very much.

David reaches into his pocket and gives the man a dollar.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't been here in years. I hope this is enough. If it isn't, take some from the clerk. I gave him a hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The Porter looks at David and walks out without saying a word.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think if Liberace had children, this would be their room. Cute little hearts, aren't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should ask for a bigger bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hold onto the cash we have. I don't want any more favors. We can try and push these together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
They try but they find very quickly that hearts don't fit together. After a few attempts, they give up.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we can crawl over the ventricles when we want to have sex. It'll be exciting. Why don't you order something up, okay? Order up a great meal and some great champagne. I'll go run the bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David walks into the bathroom. Nancy sits down on the bed. She picks up the room service menu and starts to read through it. She calls to David.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the bath?

</NANCY>
<DAVID>

<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no reason to lie to you. Go look for yourself. There's a very teeny, heart-shaped shower and a medium sized, heart- shaped sink. At best, we can wash our socks together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you disappointed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we shouldn't order room service. We should get dressed and go down and check out some of these restaurants. Hey, do you want to see a show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to leave the room. I just want to be with you tonight, here. It's our honeymoon. We should order up like we planned and then we can figure out a way to make love. Somewhere in this room, there has to be space.

<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. We're going to have fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm joking with you. Now, hurry up, I'm getting horny. When you come out, I'll be the naked one on the right heart. I might even be looking at myself in the mirror and masturbating. Although, I don't think I can see myself through all this gold flock.

He pushes past the Guard. He looks frantically around trying to find Nancy. At this hour of the morning, it's easy to spot people. There aren't too many of them. He sees her. She's off in the corner at the roulette table. There's a small group of people around her. They seem to be watching, she seems to be gambling. David walks as fast as he can. He doesn't want to run, his robe might open up. As he approaches Nancy, he is frightened by what he sees. She is a maniac. She has been up for hours. The transformation is scary. It's like Jekyll and Hyde. She's frantically moving chips all around the table.

David stands there. He's thinking, staring straight ahead. Out of an office emerges JACK SHUSTER, the Pit Boss, the man we saw earlier. Shuster's a large man, in his early fifties.

	Anyway, we were going to find ourselves. Then, we thought, maybe we're too old, it's too late. We can't find ourselves, that's only for kids. And then we thought about it some more and it hit us. Wait a minute. Who's to say at what age you stop being a kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

	You gotta have some age. How else could a court separate rape from fun? In this state, it's eighteen, by the way.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But my point is we wanted to find ourselves and we did and we dropped out, just like they did in "Easy Rider."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy what?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Didn't see that, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a classic. If it comes on cable here, see it. Anyway, we did something that no one has done for a long time. Maybe no one has ever done it because in the movie they were movie stars, so they didn't really do it, even though they portrayed people that did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting mixed up here. What is your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we did it for real. We quit our jobs and we sold everything that we had. The only thing we own is our little motor home, which is parked outside. That's all we've got and we were going to spend years roaming around this beautiful country, but we knew we couldn't do it unless we had our little nest egg tucked away in the bank.

	I'm going off duty in a few minutes. Now, your point is what?

<DAVID>

	I'm getting to it. Why did we come to Las Vegas? Because it was a new beginning and I wanted to remarry my lovely wife. That's nice, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to get remarried but I wanted to spend our honeymoon in the Grand Canyon, places like we intend to spend the rest of our lives in, but my wife is very fond of your hotel and all of the employees and she said, "Oh, come on, let's spend our honeymoon here." And we did and the room was very lovely and everybody was very nice to us, but my wife lost the nest egg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Howard, stop right here. I think I know what you're getting at. I realize you've lost a great deal here and I want you to know that your room and your meals are comped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very nice but that's not exactly what I'm saying. I think I have a multi-million dollar idea. Now, you have to be very secretive about what I'm going to tell you because the other hotels, if they heard about it, well, they'll grab it in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David leans over Shuster's desk and whispers to make the idea really sound secretive:
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think, as an experiment, you give us back the money we lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, imagine the publicity? I mean, the Hilton, for example, they have billboards all over L.A. where they put the faces of the winners of those slot machines. Now, those people win a couple hundred thousand dollars, but the hotel is getting millions of dollars of publicity with those billboards because people drive by and say, "Gee, the Hilton looks like a nice place. Look at those smiling people." So, what about a billboard with my wife and I on it and we would be smiling and there would be a saying, something like, "These people dropped out of society, they couldn't take it any longer, but they made a mistake. They lost their nest egg at The Desert Inn, but The Desert Inn gave it back." And maybe there could be some kind of a visual with you handing us an egg or something. Now I mean, I'm just formulating this now, as I'm talking, but you can imagine, when it's worked out how effective it could be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. That's great.

</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. Wait... Not "Gamblers, get your money back." That's wrong. We're not gamblers. We're the few people in society that have tried to do something with our lives. See? We're drop- outs. We're finding ourselves. Someone's got to help the few people like us, because if they don't, nobody will ever drop out again. Nobody will ever have the courage to find themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I understand what you mean, but I don't think The Desert Inn can help find you. I'm sorry, but thank you for the idea and good night.

He begins to escort David to the door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I've experienced this before. I've had clients that didn't understand the idea until they saw it on television and then they said, "My God! What a brilliant idea! Why didn't I understand this?" I might have used the wrong phrase. Okay, picture this: maybe, my wife and I will do a television commercial for you and there could be a jingle and it could go:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begins to sing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Desert Inn has heart! The Desert Inn has heart! The Desert Inn has heart!" Something like that. See what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a nice jingle. Mr. Howard, let's assume you're serious here. What if this caught on? Could you imagine what would happen? Why, we would have to return everybody's losses. The casino would just crumble. We couldn't pay our bills. You know the casino accounts for a great deal of our profits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. Of course, you don't pay back everybody's losses. You make a distinct division between the bold, who are out there searching, and all the other schmucks, who come here to see Wayne Newton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<SHUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Now, I like Wayne Newton. So, I fall into what category?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUSTER>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing this was not the best example)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look, I picked a name out of a hat. I like Wayne Newton, too. I'm saying a schmuck, representing the gambler and a bold person, representing me and my wife and the one or two others that probably wouldn't come here anyway. You wouldn't have to do this more than once or twice, there's not too many bold people around. I think it was a mistake to use entertainers as the dividing line. We could find another system. Anyway, what do you say? We do need that nest egg back.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I say good luck to you and stay away from the tables next time.

But it wasn't taken wrong. What happened? Macy's did much better than they ever did before. And that's what would happen to you. The Desert Inn would do much, much better because you would get Gimble's business and the casino would be full.

	I have nothing to say.

David says nothing. He just clears his throat.

<NANCY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
More silent driving. Nancy is desperately uncomfort- able. Obviously, David is not fine. How could he be? He's seen ten years of earnings dissipate in less than three hours and he didn't participate in any of the dissipation. After a while, Nancy tries a new approach.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously, I can't apologize anymore for what I did so we should talk about what we're going to do.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what would that be?

</DAVID>
<NANCY>

David clears his throat again.

<NANCY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We have eight hundred and two dollars.

	It is something. Yes.

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look, I think we should try to make the rest of the day as pleasant as we can. Since we're heading towards Hoover Dam anyway, we should make that our destination for today. We can go there, look around, maybe have a picnic or something, and maybe just see the dam and just have a nice day outside. What do you think?

There are people walking around, tours going on and children playing. The motor home pulls up. They park. Nancy gets out with a bounce in her step, hoping David might copy her. David gets out like Frankenstein, walking very slowly, with no expression.

<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because with the little bit of money that we have left, I think we have to sit down and make up a new budget. Until we do, maybe we shouldn't spend it all on cotton candy and other various knickknacks here at the dam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Nancy is beginning to get irritated and frustrated that he will not talk to her like an adult.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if that's your attitude, I think you should give me half the money and let me eat whatever I want and you can do what you want with your half. I think that's the fair thing.

<DAVID>

</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out where? This is where we're going to have to live. Why not yell out here? We're going to have to do everything else out here. We'll be sleeping out here and eating out here and going to the bathroom out here! Get used to this cement, baby! This is it! Out here is it! We found ourselves! We found ourselves, alright! We found ourselves with eight hundred dollars in the middle of nowhere!

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't sleep. I see. Now, I remember nights where I couldn't sleep. I'm just trying to think what I did. Let's see. I tried warm milk or I took a long walk or I took Nytol and then, if all that didn't work, I gave away all the money I ever earned. But you didn't try any of those things first. You just gave away the money first, right? What did you intend to do? Have warm milk afterwards? Tell me. I'm mixed up.

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you have done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would I have done? I would have followed you. I would've seen you. I would have watched you take your money and begin to lose it and I would have stopped you at thirty dollars, maybe thirty-two dollars, at the most. I would have said, "Sweetheart, come back to bed. We don't want to fool with our nest egg." You know, Nancy, I think you just considered nest egg to be a term but to me, it was a key to this whole experiment. Why, I considered it like a third person. It was our best friend, our guardian angel. It was going to allow us to do everything we wanted to do. It was going to watch over us during bad times and laugh with us during good times. It was going to help us roam and purchase and eat and explore. It was going to help us make love and laugh and cry and now, it's gone and who's got it? The Desert Inn! They've got our nest egg. They can sure use it, can't they? They don't have their own. They're a poor little organization. They need our nest egg. Gee, I hope they use it wisely. I know someday those mirrors are going to have to be reflocked and the red velvet was looking kind of worn. And those little heart beds are going to need new sheets. I'm glad we could help them pay for that. I'm glad our life savings will go towards making that room look a little prettier. I'm glad we gave it all to them, Nancy. I'm just going to miss the little nest egg, that's all. Won't you, sweetheart? Won't you miss the nest egg? In the middle of the night, won't you feel kind of lonely because little nest egg is paying for the gas in Frank Sinatra's limo?

	Alright. The movie you're basing your whole life on, "Easy Rider," they dropped out with nothing. They had no nest egg.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying?

	I'm saying that if we got remarried it would be much more difficult to get divorced. Now it's easy. It's over. I'll just stay in Nevada for six weeks and then we'll be legally through. This is how it should have happened anyway, David. We were stupid to think it could have happened any other way.

	Well, look at this. A woman has to help you by yelling for the police. Well, if I wasn't wanted, I wouldn't care. I'd stay here and beat the shit out of you, but right now I can't afford to see the police. But I'll get you. I don't know where or when, but I'll get you, mister.

	First? First, I think we fill this thing with gas so we can get as far away as possible from that mental patient. Then, I guess we'll head east. We'll drive until we find a place we both like and that'll be our new home. We'll start there and we'll begin to rebuild.

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear to God I think this is a blessing in disguise. The whole idea of going to Las Vegas was to get remarried so we could have a new beginning, right? Well, that would've just been a ceremony. Now, we really are starting from the beginning. I think this way is much better.

	Well, I hope it is. But since we really will never know the other way, let's not compare.

</DAVID>
<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I'm saying. The manager's thinking it over. He said he'll let me know tomorrow. I don't want to jinx it. Now, come on. Let's hear about you. What happened?

David can't get over the words "Assistant Manager." His own search hasn't brought him words of that caliber. He hedges.

<NANCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of offers?

	No. If you're going to interrupt me I'm not going to be able to explain it. It's stop an one side and stop on the other. It's just a stop sign. So, when you want people to go you'll have to hide the sign.

	That's right. I remember. You just put it down so people can't see.

	Well, all children are rude.

<MAN>

	Well, these children are a little ruder than they used to be. You see we had this cutback in the school lunch program and sometimes they're hungry. And you know what happens when you're hungry? You get a little bit ornery. I guess what I'm saying is you'll need a little bit of tolerance.

EXT. STREET SCENE - DAY

David is at the crosswalk. He's leading a group of CHILDREN across the street. They are about twelve years old. Obviously, old enough to cross by them- selves. David greets them. He wants to make a good impression. God knows why.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

The Kids glare at him. David walks back across the street alone. David is waiting. A bunch of KIDS, a little older, about six of them, walk up. One of them says:

	Yeah, Retardo.

	My name is David. I would appreciate not being called that name. It's an ugly name.

<OLDER_KID_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugly name for an ugly face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_KID_2>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see no reason to walk future prisoners across the street. Why don't you get some practice working on your own right now since you'll probably be in solitary most of your life. You can handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<OLDER_KID_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, man. That's what you're paid for. Come on. Take us across the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_KID_2>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't take you across the street and, also, I'm allowed to make judgments. If I think someone shouldn't be allowed to cross the street I'm allowed to deny them that privilege. So, if you want to cross, you'll have to cross on your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<OLDER_KID_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, no. No, man. You work for us. Let's go.

He leads them across the street. David walks back alone, mumbling. He sits in his little chair. There's no action and no children. Cars are passing by. A new black MERCEDES SCREECHES UP. The passenger window is electrically lowered. A GUY, in his early 30's, calls to David.

	Burger King?

</DAVID>
<NANCY>

Just after David finishes this sentence, we hear the TOILET FLUSH. Out comes SKIP, a nineteen-year-old boy, dressed in the male version of the same uniform Nancy is wearing. Skip is one of those kids who talks like he's from Torrance, through his nose, blending all syl- lables into one, a kid whose speech could mask his intelligence, if there was intelligence to be masked.

	Hey, thanks. Well, you know the fry machine? We were never using it right. See, no one ever told us. I mean we did everything the instructions said. You know, we put the oil in and everything, but we took the fries out, like, much too soon and no one knew. And your wife said, "Hey, these are frozen in the middle." And then we took them outside and we looked at 'em in the sun and she was right! They were still frozen. She spotted it on the first day! Do you believe it?

	I know you did. But now, let's talk facts. Our nest egg broke. Forget who did it, no blame. That's not the point. The point is we didn't split up. We stayed together and decided to rebuild. And it was the best decision we ever made. Because for the first time we really know how to share. Whatever we have we can enjoy it together.

	But we don't have anything.

<DAVID>

	There! Now we're getting to it. This afternoon I was guiding some children across the street and I realized something. Given our age, and the years we have left together, and the way we're going about this rebuilding program, we will never have another egg in our lifetime.

As they do the THEME from the commercial "I LOVE NEW YORK" BEGINS TO PLAY. It grows and grows in intensity as David and Nancy cross the United States. Their trip from Arizona to New York will take place in a space of about thirty seconds. States whiz by.

It's Monday morning, 8:45. Thousands of New Yorkers are filing into their offices. We see the motor home pull up in front of the advertising agency. Hundreds of people are entering this building. We see that one of these people is Brad Tooley, the baldheaded man David was supposed to work under. From a LONG SHOT, we see David exit the motor home. He's still in his crossing guard uniform. He's been up for three days, taking No Doz and drinking hundreds of cups of coffee. He looks like hell. He runs down the street and corners Brad near the front entrance. Brad sees David. He's scared. He can't believe it. He starts to run. He tries to escape. David turns after him. All this is shown in a LONG SHOT, with the busy Madison Avenue traffic in the foreground. We hear David yelling:

	Brad, I made it! Three weeks on the button! Let's go to work. We got Fords to sell!

Brad looks frightened. He'd like to get away but he can't. David catches up to him. He grabs him around the waist. He drops to his knees. He begins to plead. As New Yorkers pass by going about their business, we see David begging. Brad just staring down at him.

Those that do should take Route 16. This goes through Utah, avoiding the state of Nevada completely."
