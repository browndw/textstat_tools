Amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and gray. He's eating crackers from a cellophane package, sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE.

</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, listen... you're not supposed to be smoking in here. I'm sorry, that's company policy...

<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE STREET

Welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK... Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The familiar DRONE of flight. Welles is shoehorned into his aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle. Welles picks up his tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt, struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his tray, letting the woman in to the window seat.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

Passengers arrive. Welles is with them, searching the few PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway. Welles smiles...

<DIRECTION>
Welles' wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him. She's plain and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her. Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>

<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not accusing you...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the detective business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles and Amy make love in the darkness. Standard, missionary position sex, little passion. They slow to a finish, uneventfully, holding each other. Their breathing quiets. Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on the edge of the bed. Amy covers herself.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

An old money office with windows over the river. A well-to- do POLITICIAN looks unhappily through PHOTOS on his desk. Welles sits by the Pennsylvania state flag, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami: leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clears his throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman. It's unpleasant, I know. I apologize...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<POLITICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None too discreet, is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLITICIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, he is not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<POLITICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLITICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The politician shakes his head in disgust. Welles rises.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<POLITICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLITICIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunny day. Welles wears tan khakis, T-shirt and fishing cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower. Welles' yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow. One of his neighbors is repainting a back porch. The neighbor waves. Welles waves, resumes mowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC'S LOUD. League Night. Every lane full. Welles is with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS. Welles hoists his ball, preparing to bowl. He takes three steps, releases...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the lane, PINS SCATTER. One pin remains standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his rowdy, mocking teammates. He shouts back at them, laughing, grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinner. Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy in a high chair. Amy feeds Cindy between bites. Welles is still in his league shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I'll call the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have bridge here Saturday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Welles nods, eating. He watches Amy feed Cindy. The PHONE starts RINGING. Welles goes to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(into PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Yes... could you hold on a minute...?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the desk. The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE. Welles picks up the phone and cups the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts upstairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I've got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello... sorry, I was switching phones. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, I understand... tomorrow evening should be fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens. Welles' car heads down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door. Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders. Far across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I try to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate your coming on such short notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh, pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm listening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of what sort?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a private investigator?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, how theatrical. So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Longdale's irritated, but has no choice. He walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a pleasant evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Welles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table. Welles watches Longdale exit.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's odd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(offers tea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, sit, here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles nods, sipping tea.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My condolences.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do whatever I can to help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Christian studies Welles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Christian and Welles enter. This office has been lived in for a lifetime. Giant DESK. AMERICAN FLAG. Walls covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large, baked enamel sign nailed up, "CHRISTIAN STEEL."
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His inner sanctum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR. CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming, industrial landscape behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not many people have been inside this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies, shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pittsburgh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mostly. That's where he started his empire building.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up at portrait)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He succeeded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles waits.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a WALL SAFE. The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at safe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to tell me what you found?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cash, stock certificates, and this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a movie showing a girl being murdered. She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only watched what I could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles picks up the film, looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leads her to a chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film." But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth. Like, red light district folklore. There's no such thing, I can assure you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Christian shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you it's not that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_CHRISTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you watch it and see for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CHRISTIAN>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>

INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall. Welles looks back to Mrs. Christian in the doorway. Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the door. Darkness. Welles turns on the projector and sits. The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a nondescript room with little furniture. Looks like a hotel room. We only ever see three walls. The once beautiful girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes, staring blankly. The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl still stares oblivious. The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and DUCT TAPE. The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with eye holes and a mouth. The mask covers his entire head. He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled, pale. The man goes to stand in front of the girl. He seems to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole CLATTER. It's all one long take. The CAMERA MOVES to favor the girl...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the girl, knocking her back on the bed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated position. The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes closed, but she remains upright. Masked Man uses his thumbs to open her unseeing eyes. He touches her mouth with his fingers, presses his lips to hers. Then, Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out. Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles rises slowly, still watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves back towards the girl...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful. WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles does. In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his fist to his mouth, breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall. The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING. Welles is sickened, sweating, still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.

	No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...

	It won't work like that.

	Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.

IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his identification: a laminated "LICENSED INVESTIGATOR, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", with WELLES' PHOTO...

	What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are reasons for the way we do things here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>

The director sits back in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shows the POLICE ARTIST SKETCH he photocopied)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>

	Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?

<DIRECTOR>

</DIRECTOR>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't they come to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not so sure about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits forward, hand on the projector. He's seen something. He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the image. He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME...

FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves forward... door closing behind him... STOP...

FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom mirror. Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.

Welles compares the two pictures. She's prettier in the card catalog photo, but it's her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles can't believe it, looks around. Secretaries at other files don't even know he's there. Welles pulls out his notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Writing the girl's name: "Mary Anne Matthews."

Welles works the MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling through old issues of the LOCAL NEWSPAPER, finds an ARTICLE headlined "Search Continues for Local Teen."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive.
</DIRECTION>

Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes. Welles' car parks in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages. He drums his fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports, uses them to pad the file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket. He considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.

Welles knocks, clipboard in hand. A sad, middle-aged woman answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.

	Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs. Mathews to see it looks official.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I don't understand, who are... ?

</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holds up clipboard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>

Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...

(looking on legal pad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair. Born April 24, 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ?

<DIRECTION>
(looks at watch)

Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.

EXT. DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly what I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles smiles. Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette. Welles lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just seemed... depressed... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was she running from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think he did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It got to be too much for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to ask. I apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is miserable. A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at Mrs. Mathews. She tries not to notice then noticing.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People remember me from the news.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you drive me back now?

	Of course.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews enters. Welles follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink sheets of the carefully made bed. Perfectly preserved.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is her room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks around, uncomfortable. Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are for her birthday. One for every year she's missed. They'll be waiting for her when she comes back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide it. He backs to the door, looks at his watch...
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

EXT. MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles escapes to his car, climbing in. He starts it up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes. He has to pull over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Welles has unpacked. He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...

	You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey.

	I'm okay. It's hard here. It's hard.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I've got a lead I have to follow through. To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you. I love you.

</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits at the kitchen table. Mrs. Mathews makes coffee. The home's decor is cheap and flowery.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We weren't religious. We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids. We never made her go to church. But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you religious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There wasn't one. The police looked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think the police did a good job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You don't have any reason to think that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How... how can you say that to me...?

</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you let me look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MRS_MATHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MATHEWS>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't you rather know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>

Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.

	Go ahead and look if you want. I don't care what you do.

Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.

INT. MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was... searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens CABINETS under the sink...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair, staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares. He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the ceiling. There's an ATTIC DOOR there. Welles reaches to the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT, crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents... Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS in mothballs. He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out, opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE. He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray. Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "Mary Anne Mathews."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns pages. The DIARY'S about half-full of feminine, cursive handwriting. After the last written page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT. Welles fingers the ragged edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE. Welles sits and reads...
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (emotionless monotone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Dear mom. If you're reading this, it means I called you from Hollywood, California and told you where to find my diary. I don't think I'll be able to tell you this when I talk to you, so I'm writing it down here. You know I haven't been happy for a long, long time. For a long time now dad's been doing things I couldn't tell you. He's been touching me and it's getting worse. I can't stay anymore. I know you and I haven't always gotten along sometimes, but please don't blame yourself. There isn't anything you can do. I'm going to make a whole new life in California. Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or in magazines. Don't worry about me. Love, Mary Anne."

Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him. Mrs. Mathews' food isn't even unwrapped.

She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever consider... do you realize that Mary may never come back?

Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.

</DIRECTION>

	She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that. But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...

Mrs. Mathews doesn't even notice, doesn't look up.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of his car. Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door.

INT. VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door. He watches Welles pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks around, uncomfortable. A few of the other CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles. Display shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink- wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES. Welles pretends to browse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Handmade signs above each section identify content: "ANAL," "BIG TITS," "CUMSHOTS," "BONDAGE and FETISH," etc...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles. Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he's considering it. He glances at other customers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography. One guy has his arms full of about ten videos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter. The clerk watches him the whole time.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>

<DIRECTION>
Welles comes in through the blacked-out door. This place is larger than the last. TWO CLERKS are behind the counter. One clerk's pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno- novel. Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles browses. There's a huge video bargain bin. Walls are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back. A MAN looks around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely, slipping behind one curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of dildos, looks towards the front...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and highlights a section in the book he's reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles notes this. He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it. He selects sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet. Max starts ringing everything up.

Turning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: "Adults Only," "She Male Films," "Amateur Sex Videos," "Women and Animals -- you've got to see it to believe it..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back, again, page after page: "Watersports and Fisting Specialists," "100's of Anal Films," "Asian Sex..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUNDREDS of 900 NUMBER ads with naked women urging callers to pick up the phone. EROTIC CLASSIFIEDS; hundreds of amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and genitalia blacked over... "Men Seeking Women," "Women Seeking Women", "Men Seeking Men," "Transvestites..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is endless. More CLASSIFIEDS: "Sex Slaves Wanted," "ACTRESSES WANTED," "Underground Films," "SPECIALTY FILMS OFFERED," "S+M and BONDAGE," "Fetish Videos."

Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between decaying brink buildings. They cone to a STAIRWELL leading down to pitch dark...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow, labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs. Welles follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to another STAIRWAY leading down. At the bottom, a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors.
</DIRECTION>
<GOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOON>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind of small, underground porn flea market. It's incredibly quiet. About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows. The MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS" looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<ONE_DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're shutting down in fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
Welles makes his way to the tables, wary. One table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked. Each photo is wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles swallows back disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next table is piled high with used pornographic MAGAZINES. There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out. X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out, "two," "sixteen," "five." And many bootleg VIDEOS with grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures. Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry looking DEALER who's counting money.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(points to numbered videos)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are these?

</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>

<ANGRY_DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGRY_DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer sits and keeps counting cash. Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED DOORWAY. Welles walks to it, enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CURTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Folding chairs face a SCREEN. A PROJECTOR shows a silent movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube. A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating. A few chairs away, a man is bent over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<LARGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to pay to come in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARGE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.

INT. ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not many people in the place. Welles drinks coffee. Max eats a huge breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. Somebody's buying those videos. Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It's only gonna get worse. More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.

	Interesting theory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We're talking about stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Child pornography.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snuff films.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.

Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches Max and Welles say goodnight. Max walks to a waiting taxi.

INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the film makes its way through, threading out. The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected onto the wall. CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off. The PHONE'S RINGING. Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at the cellular phone on the bedside table. RINGING...

Welles lets it RING. RINGING... RINGING... till it finally stops. Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it. He takes out some of Mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING. Resting on a SWEATER are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten. Welles examines them, frowning, puts them aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS, "July 2, 1992." Several job possibilities circled, others crossed out. He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and an ADDRESS BOOK. Welles examines the address book, finds a folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Star light, star bright, First star I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish I might, Have this wish I wish tonight."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's DIARY. He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts the DIARY PAGE against it. Perfect match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stands looking at the poem. He turns the page over, finds written, in cursive:

<DIRECTION>
Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath. A couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator. Welles moves down the hall, around a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass. There's a "Dental Office," "Wilson Travel Cruises," and at the end of the hall, "Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole, Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804."

Welles heads back the way he came.

Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building. There's a sign on this adjacent building, "OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty office. Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD. Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and opens the blinds.

Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it, an ARMY COT against one wall. Welles sits in a chair at the window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his breath. Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles locks the tripod. He goes to sit on the army cot, picks up his CELLULAR. He looks at the phone, deciding. He puts down the phone. He turns off the LAMP on the floor, lays back in the cot, going to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of Celebrity Films Inc. We can see most of the office from here. It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES. There's a disorganized DESK by the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits looking through the binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud, print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail. He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of rings. He drinks coffee, answers the phone. He talks into the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles rises. He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror. Welles comes to study this third photo.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the call, hanging up. He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the drink, walks out of view. After a moment, the lights go out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting roads of the Hollywood Hills. Eddie's at the wheel. Not far behind, Welles' rental car follows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a ramshackle HOUSE, parks. Welles' car passes by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around, moving back down the hill, slowly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns out his headlights, coming around the curve just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view. Welles watches Eddie walk up the stairs to the house.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie has a visitor. There's a pretty GIRL, wearing a tube top, in a chair facing his desk. Eddie's talking, gesticulating, smiling, cajoling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches through binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's still taking, stands, coming around the desk and placing a hand on the girl's shoulder. The girl says something. Eddie responds. The woman shakes her head, getting up to leave. Eddie seems to be asking her to stay, following as she moves out of view. Eddie comes back alone, sits at his desk, picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ESPIONAGE SHOP -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ultra high tech for sale. Welles examines items on the sales counter as the SALESPERSON watches: a pair of sma1l, round LISTENING DEVICES, a complicated RECEIVER/TAPE RECORDER, and a TONE DECODER with LED window.

The blue building sits completely dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves. He moves down the hall to the door of "Celebrity Films Inc."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it. He takes out his penlight. There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the wall that we couldn't see through binoculars. Titles like "Sex Doctor," "Deep Ass," and "Penal Colony."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There a two FILE CABINETS. Welles pulls a few drawers, finds them locked. VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles goes to Eddie's desk, looking in drawers. One drawer is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES. Another's stuffed with paperwork, call sheets, contracts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece. He takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket, peels off backing to expose adhesive. He attaches the listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the penlight. He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock- picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the lock, opens a file drawer. Empty. He opens another. Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles clenches his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faces of children. Shirtless boys. Girls in pigtails.
</DIRECTION>

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone. He CANNOT BE HEARD any longer. He's cursing, shuffling paperwork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone. He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks back through the binoculars. He waits, clears his throat. The PHONE'S RINGING... RINGING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...

</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone. He stands, looking down at the phone, frozen. Finally, he runs his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back down. He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.
</DIRECTION>

Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

<DIRECTION>
THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's found them. He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is you, isn't it, Eddie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER. Its LED window LIGHTS UP. Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...1 212 555 9906...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits.

INT. NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Busy and crowded, but quiet. Welles places a massive tome down on a table: "Haines Criss-Cross Directory."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone number written: "(212) 555-9906." He opens the reference book, searching pages...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each with an address. Welles runs his finger down the page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOHO STREETS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDESTRIANS everywhere. Streets are clogged with DELIVERY TRUCKS loading and unloading. Cars horns blow. Welles walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder with other buildings, labeled "1204" in burnished steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt." The middle button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks up at the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is low. Less activity on the street. Welles leans against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel bags. They start up the stairs of 1204...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women hit the center button. A BUZZER sounds as they head inside. Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the door before it closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR. One woman hits "2." Welles hits "3," steps back in the corner. Elevator doors creak closed. The two women are heavily made up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR. The two women get out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS painted black. Welles stops the elevator door from closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors. Another dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter. The low rumble of HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles lets the elevator close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR. Welles gets out, instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with fire escapes above. There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing. Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks to make sure he's alone. He starts tearing open GARBAGE BAGS. Flies swarm. One bag's filled with empty food containers and old newspapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS. He pulls out a few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures chopped out from many pages. Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

INT. WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN. WE SEE NOTHING. We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a VCR, tosses it aside, tired. He picks another Dino Velvet TAPE, puts it in, sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles opens another beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by candelabras. Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling. Then, the bound woman, struggling. A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters. He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This focuses Welles' attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max... wake up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(points at TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Max tries to see, eyes barely open.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches. On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body. Huge arms, thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? He have something to do with whatever you're into?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... it's nothing... that's not him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles rubs his eyes, sits back. Max sits up, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking. He pulls down the woman's blindfold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE. The IMAGE on TV FREEZES. Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face. FREEZE FRAME. On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked Man in the snuff film. A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he, his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody knows his name. That's his thing. He always wears a mask. You never see his face. He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him. Machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Welles hits PLAY. On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and down the woman's body. The woman's eyes are filled with fear. Welles sits, unnerved, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a brutal motherfucker, man. He loves what he does for a living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK BOX. At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the combination, opens it. He takes out the holster, stands looking down at the gun. He puts the holster on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on. A car pulls out of a parking space. Welles takes the space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max is in the passenger seat. Welles looks to 1204.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey hall, to the black doors. Welles pushes the INTERCOM BUTTON. After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (from intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles waits, presses the button again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large, dark, converted warehouse. Square pillars shoot from floor to ceiling. Shafts of light cut down from high windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.
</DIRECTION>
<THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in the wrong place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THUG>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're looking for Mr. Velvet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THUG>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE, massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you tell him we're here to give him a large sum of money. If he's not interested, we'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should leave now, before I have to remove you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THUG>
<DIRECTION>
Welles just stands looking at the thug. A VOICE is HEARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (from SPEAKERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show them in, Milo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles and Max look up. There are SPEAKERS mounted high up on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard the boss, Milo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards a distant DOOR. Welles and Max follow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in. The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned up to form an indecipherable collage. A tall LADDER leans against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man, wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles shakes Dino's hand. Max looks up at the walls. IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do for you today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits. Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM. VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fellow investor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Welles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you say is your favorite piece?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles considers. Max glances over, looks back to the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said something about money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's five thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to watch you work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll consider it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's not him, there's no deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Welles' nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes to look at Welles, studying him.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather you didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm camera shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are two different kinds of trust.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles leaves. Max goes with him. Dino watches them leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORNS BLARE. TWO CARS have collided head-on. A large CROWD gathers. One windshield's shattered, blood spattered. The driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE. HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone. A NAKED WOMAN dances for Dino. A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three o'clock, tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles digs out his notepad, writing.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>

(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Brooklyn. Don't be late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD. Max and Welles sit in lawn chairs at the tiny pool. Welles smokes. Max drinks beer. They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board. Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Max looks at it again, can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look... that's awful generous and everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not my money. The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought. Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go be a race car driver. Go run for President. Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles walks away, heading to his room. Max watches him go, doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied buildings. A few burnt out cars on the street. Welles drives through, watchful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn. He parks the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to the darkness. A vast, empty space looms before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are. Come join us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino. MACHINE is seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the warehouse. He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS propped up. He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE. As Welles gets closer, he notices several things ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along with several movie LIGHTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside a pair of HANDCUFFS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Machine is watching him as he approaches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his distance. Dino's still firing arrows at the target. Machine's still staring at Welles.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(to Machine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You brought the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(takes out envelope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then turns to look at Welles with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the women?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They should be here any minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the table, beside Bowie knifes. He's sweating.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
(of the knifes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are these for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Dino walks across towards the target.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Machine and I were just talking about knifes. The beauty of knifes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Dino pulls arrows from the target.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp. The ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non-intrusive. Flesh is fooled. It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Dino shoots another arrow to the target. A CLATTER attracts Welles attention. Far across the warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards. A CAR with tinted windows drives in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, ours guests have arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Machine stands. He is a giant. Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take out your gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles brings his hand towards his holster...
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slowly. Let me see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way. Can't tell who he is yet. Machine heads the direction of the parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't know what this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer. It's Eddie Poole.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
(to Welles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Welles obeys, walks to the bed. Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't know what to make of you at first, and you certainly had Eddie on pins and needles. But, lo and behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything...

Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.
</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand. And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive...

</DINO_VELVET>
<DIRECTION>
Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DINO_VELVET>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.

</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was well compensated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind how I found you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>

	Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>

	None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers.

Welles looks at Longdale.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>

</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.

	Shut your mouth and drive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up? Tell me, because I really want to understand. Did he jerk off to it? You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Longdale jams the gun against Welles' side.
</DIRECTION>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making me very angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me. Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're asking me why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>

Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.

	A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<LONGDALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it incredibly obvious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONGDALE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

Eddie runs towards Welles.

There's his gun, lying there, far away.

<DIRECTION>
Eddie runs for the gun.

She's been dead a long fucking time. Nobody fucking cares!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar, drags him to the floor, face down. Welles stands on Eddie's neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

<DIRECTION>
Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BIG BEAR -- DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is low. Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by wilderness on all sides. Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heavy forests border close to the road. Welles' car travels alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken neon and peeled paint: "Big Bear Motor Lodge."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROADWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center with attached wings of rooms on both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out skeleton. What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is boarded over, falling apart. No window has gone unbroken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns out headlights and parks. He gets out, walks to look up the driveway. A CAR is HEARD. HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the forest as the CAR PASSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it. Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge. Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him. Welles pushes Eddie forward, gun out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the room. There dead leaves all over the floor. The room's empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light. This is where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the snuff film, without the furniture.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and Welles' palely lit face.

	Nobody saw you bring her in?

</WELLES>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.

</EDDIE>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do with her body?

Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

</WELLES>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fucking don't know. What do you think... we weren't burying treasure. We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it. We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never find her. Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing. Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all. Without the film, it never happened. Don't you get it? It's over. You can't do anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>

Eddie walks towards Welles. Welles backs away...
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you going? You're the one with the gun. Aren't I defenseless enough? Come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead and kill me. Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name? Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it. Fucking do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's forehead, pulls back the hammer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...

INT. MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Eddie's thrown face down to the floor. Welles comes to sit on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun, takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You pussy.
	</DIALOGUE>

Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape, till Eddie's securely bound.

<DIRECTION>
Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his wit's end. He opens the glove compartment, finds cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back to the motel room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR PHONE. After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at it in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back, staring at the sky. He closes his eyes, smokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers. He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad, pages through, studies one page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits up. He gathers himself, throws his cigarette, dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB. Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there wasn't anything anyone could do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the ground, utterly drained. He puts his forearm over his eyes, gasping, sucking air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing it to fuel his rage...
</DIRECTION>

He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the gun and pours the bullets out. He closes the gun and walks towards the motel room...

Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

The door SLAMS to the floor.

Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...

Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST. CRICKETS and distant BIRDS. We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS through the open door of the room. A CAR is HEARD, getting LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered red. His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks back into the room, backing away. He turns and goes to his car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his shirt, revolted. He starts the car.

A relatively quiet residential street. HOMES are small, two story affairs, close together, each very much like its neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street. CHILDREN in school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles parallel parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns off the engine. He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street. The house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top, quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars pass in the street. Welles watches school children pass on the near sidewalk. He slumps down a little in his seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side mirror, rolling up the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun, pours bullets out and pockets them. He picks up a PAPER BAG off the passenger seat and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along the gun's inner barrel.

INT. WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house. He looks in his side mirror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn signal on. Welles slumps a little lower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car passes, slowing. The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint house begins to open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches... Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back of his head, but he's huge. It's a good bet it's Machine. Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's garage. After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses. She goes to the sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman goes back to the garage. She goes inside. The garage door closes behind her.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles still watches the house. There's a light on in one of the second floor windows, curtains closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture window. Looks like a living room or dining room. The old woman comes to sit at a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH BINOCULARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman says something to someone we cannot see. She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of her. After a moment, someone joins her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge forearms. The lacy curtains of the window block part of our view, so we never see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen putting a plate of food in front of the old woman. The old woman smiles up at him, says something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches, then goes back to stand beside the old woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room. The old woman starts to eat.

INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn light is just breaking. Welles has fallen asleep, slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused. He calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles sees this, keeps low, watching... The big car backs out into the street. The old woman's behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind him. He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all directions, making sure no one's around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, the garage door begins to close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too conspicuous. The garage door's halfway down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off. The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK. Welles moves towards the door to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer. His huge hands push clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer, taking out the WRESTLING MASK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles enters from the garage, gun up. The dank basement is small. A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING MACHINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two metal poles. Welles leads with his gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves around the sheets, looking behind them. There's a WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs. Welles starts up, treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his gun. No one here. The decor is feminine, neat and tidy. It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES. Very Home Shopping Network.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun. No sign of Machine. The whole house is dead quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls, of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into the living room area...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow shag CARPET. A pink SOFA is covered in clear plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet. Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles creeps up the stairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR. He opens the door. It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles shuts the door and moves on. There are TWO DOORS ahead, both closed. Welles takes the one to the right...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles pushes the door in, enters warily. There's a constant SCRATCHING HEARD. The room is like a child's, except the BED is huge. Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and COMIC BOOKS. A DANZIG POSTER on the wall. There's a RECORD PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it. A record turns on the turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching... Pulls it open, steps back, gun up. Nothing. Just clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stays near the door, looks around. There's a fuzzy sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby. Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns... Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE KNIFE raised to kill...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife. Machine grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand pinned. Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling. Machine's grunts, pushing the knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles struggles, overpowered. The tip of the horrible knife is inches away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance from the blade...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY, FIRES his gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free hand to Welles' throat, choking him. Welles' face reddens, bleeding from bullet fragments...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute... SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN... The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles' throat. Welles can't break the grip...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping. He struggles to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine rises, charging after...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is TACKLED from behind... Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the living room. Machine rises to give chase...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it... Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming. Welles grips another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine grips the chair by the legs. Welles SHOVES forward, pushes Machine back, letting go...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands and knees, scrambling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps... Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises, extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up... Machine gets to his feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles SHOVES through the swinging door... Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles hits the floor with Machine on top. Machine begins to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor... Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground, tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up... Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles airway with his forearm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand... frantically feeling for anything he can use...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' face is blood red...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching around to the fork...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling fingers. Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gets to his feet, looking... He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both hands and moving towards Machine...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine's getting up... Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of the frying pan...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the bottom, barely has any strength left. He looks all directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching desperately, throwing clothing aside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles searches the laundry pile...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for Welles. Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE... HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking Machine a few steps backwards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles FIRES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an empty chamber. Out of bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get back up to his feet. Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun, walking to Machine...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord. Welles stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back, pulling the clothes line with all his might...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling, struggling... till he finally stops moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard, trembling. He looks around the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his holster. He stands looking at Machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling mask, pulling it off. He rolls Machine over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles stares down at Machine. We never see Machine's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting. He looks around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still holding Machine's mask. He drops it.
</DIRECTION>

Welles crosses the street, going to his car. He gets into his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.

Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark. Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing. He's restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath. Bad dreams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around the dark room, breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cindy's in her high-chair by the table. Amy's at the KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her. Amy turns to look at him. It breaks her heart to see him so wounded, but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much forgiveness do you think I have in me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't talk about it yet... not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him. Welles looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy's head, looks back at Amy. He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY

Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing his yard. He has done some healing, though his face is still swollen and terribly bruised.

Welles pushes a cart down one aisle. He looks at his LIST, takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles waits in line with his cart. It's a long line. He takes out his wallet, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into quarters. Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully. It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles printed from early in the snuff film. Sad girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket. He looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back. He watches the roadway ahead. There's little traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO. Some CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS. Welles stares forward through the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF. He drives. The ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with tears. He tries to fight it, but can't help himself. His face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting out a loud WAIL of misery...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and over again, wiping at his tears. He lets out a little high- pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...

	Why... why... ?

INT. WELLES' HOUSE, CINDY'S ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy's in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy's crib. Cindy's asleep. The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house. Amy looks up momentarily, then returns to reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting CLOSER. Amy looks up from her book. The bedroom door's open a crack. The door slowly pushes open. Welles stands there, eyes red from crying.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy. He gets to his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around her waist. Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to tell you... I have to tell you what happened. I have to tell you everything, but we can't tell anyone else. No one else can ever know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLES>
<DIRECTION>
Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed. Welles holds tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<WELLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all I've got. You're all I've ever had.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
