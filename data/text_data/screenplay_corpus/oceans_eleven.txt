:SC: EMPTY ROOM WITH SINGLE CHAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, followed by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues, ENTERS FRAME and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

</DANNY>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.

INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table.
</DIRECTION>
<BOARD_MEMBER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOARD_MEMBER_2>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a self-destructive pattern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BOARD_MEMBER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOARD_MEMBER_3>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Glances dart between the Board Members.
</DIRECTION>
<BOARD_MEMBER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOARD_MEMBER_1>
<DIRECTION>
Danny considers.

INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ocean, Daniel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_2>
<DIRECTION>
Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sign.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(adding a piece of mail to the pile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This came today for you. Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Those your lawyers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a free man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHANGING CUBICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it: "If you were in prison, you'd be home now."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom. The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey): Life is hard out there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Any empty wintery boardwalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy. He's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DANNY'S WALLET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT BLACKJACK TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but without success. He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins. King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts. Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He quickly hides his astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon, sir. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ramon. See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit boss circles close by and glares at them both.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mistake...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(collecting his chips, doubled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Table's cold anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir. It gets busy around one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(as he goes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon, folds back the New York Times and scans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes move down the page and stop at a header -- "Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former owner, Reuben Tishkoff.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catching up on current events?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him, changed out of his dealer's threads.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ramon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad to meet you. Frank Catton wouldn't get by the gaming board.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Danny's drink and whereabouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And already turning over a new leaf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(directly, this is why he's here)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seen him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last I heard he was in L.A. Teaching movie stars how to play cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You don't have something planned already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kidding? I just became a citizen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye, and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns his eyes to heaven...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUB SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's tough now, our line of work. Everybody so serious. Too many guns, too many computers. Whadda you gonna do? Steal from ordinary people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be criminal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's left? Banks? Hah. Banks got no money. It's all electronic. Only place that still takes cash is...

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon. Interested?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Frank smiles. Danny has his answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUB SHOP - FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny pulls a business card from his jacket, picks up the phone again, and dials the card's number.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny Ocean. I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir.

(listens, finishes his bourbon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP Rusty (tall, angular, ebony) leaning against his Ford Falcon.
</DIRECTION>
<TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey, Rusty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty turns to the voice and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push down a back alley.
</DIRECTION>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I don't know if you're, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know, incorporated, but you should think about it, really, 'cause I was talking to my manager yesterday --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie, my business manager, he's also Bernie, he was telling me that since this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense. So he suggested that it'd be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty looks at him: are you stoned?
</DIRECTION>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or, or we could keep it cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
By this time, they should have entered --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where they must weave through hordes of young Hollywood nightclubbers.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Who's here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn't make it. He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a problem.

</RUSTY>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barry is here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and he brought his girlfriend.

</TOPHER>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small but stylish. Rusty enters, Topher in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, guys. Let's play some cards...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
A glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. (One star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also a known actress, to observe.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glance back at Rusty reveals: he's in for a long night.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and let's play some cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
AT TABLE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group lesson has begun.

<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred bucks to me...

<DIRECTION>
(mulling it over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, what the hell. Pocket change. Call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty leans into Topher's ear, whispering:
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To another player:
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>

SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To another player:

<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josh. Deal to your left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with her. As she distributes a fresh round:
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One McCallum neat. And four bottled waters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a poker table.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(triumphantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two pair -- nines and twos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty checks his hand: a full-house full of face cards.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
(folding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take a little break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bar, Rusty orders a double. He needs it.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting over music)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the game going?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<RUSTY>

	It's been the longest hour of my life.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm running away with your wife.

<DIRECTION>
The Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes a thumbs-up before moving away.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light- district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection. Then, out the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd. Someone familiar to him. He follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - BACK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty returns.
</DIRECTION>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that's alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Topher indicates the new arrival: Danny. Rusty looks as if there's a bad smell in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I'm not intruding.

</DANNY>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No intrusion at all --

</TOPHER>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was his name, the bouncer's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember.

</DANNY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A card player with amnesia. This should be fun.

AT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty deals the next hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? If you don't mind my asking.

</TOPHER>
<DANNY>

	Why should I mind? Two cards, please...

A beat, then:

<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incan matrimonial headmasks.

Looks are exchanged. Everyone digests that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	One card to me.

	Probably everybody in cell block E.

Now the other players realize. These guys have a relationship. In fact, a criminal one. And, judging from their steely glares across the table, not a happy one.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's all behind us now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should hope so.

Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls out his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I raise you five hundred dollars.

A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet. He and Rusty hold each other's stares.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
That does it. Josh is in. The bet's to Danny. He checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better.

(digging his wallet out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five hundred to call. And two grand more.

Danny stares Rusty down. The others look a little pale.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, you're free to do what you like. It's a lot of money. But I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It's a winner. The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the first time tonight, Rusty blanches.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the game, fellas.

	Alright. Tell me.

Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces: J.A. KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance. As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The vault at the Bellagio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another underneath it.

	If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed.

No ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a large fellow, he has to duck to exit.

As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him).

</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...

</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I thought it was much harder than that --

Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up to block the light.

</DANNY>

Rusty stares at him: enough bullshitting around.

	Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.

A beat. Rusty smiles.

<TISHKOFF>

	Are you listening to me? You are, both of you, nuts. I know more about casino security than any man alive. I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. Okay, bad example...

<DIRECTION>
BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.

EXT. DOG TRACK/BETTING WINDOW (MIAMI, FLA) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves.

Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats. He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but doesn't turn around.

Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas.

INT. CROWDED SUBWAY CAR (CHICAGO)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Native Chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth sense -- L-car balance -- as the TRAIN bends and SHAKES at a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with a flick of his thumb and forefinger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss, and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld, lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus. It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is aware of the ongoing heist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight, but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when the train hits another curve...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man of his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<LINUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry 'bout that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINUS>
<STOCKBROKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem, guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOCKBROKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNION STATION - SUBWAY STATION
</DIRECTION>

... The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. Linus jumps out, leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny steps off, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNION STATION - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hurly-burly of rush hour in Union Station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without incident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNION STATION - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings. And his face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card. On one side, in engraved printing: "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MURPHY'S BAR - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits.

	That wasn't work, that was practice.

	We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. It's one or the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill. When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. Linus is reading it.

INT. GAME ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here. Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels with the Strip running between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the eleven surround the table and the model...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And we're going to rob it.

	Smash-and-grab job, huh?

Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs.

	Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
On the monitors: three montages of black-and-white security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages, moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First: we have to get within the casino cages --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

(indicating)

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- here, here, and here --

</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- which we can't fake --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- which we won't get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself. At last, one speaks up...

The Amazing Yen. In Cantonese. Of course, no one understands him. Except Rusty.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>

	No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. Anyone else?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies...

Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him, dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he missed.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your wallet.

INT. HABERDASHERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...
</DIRECTION>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is nice material.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUL>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Armani, Saul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment."
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes icicles.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAUL>

They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never waver.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...

	Hello. My name is Lyman Zerga...

INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli...
</DIRECTION>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga...

Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last.

Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bought you a fresh roll.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for him.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Zerga, we're here.

INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE...
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, sir. How can I be of service?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't make reservations.

A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it...

INT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.

EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man. He strides into his casino and, appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.
</DIRECTION>
<LINUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet's name on the way in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.

Benedict works the room. He speaks to a Japanese High Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<LINUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers. He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents: the day's take and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINUS>
<DIRECTION>
Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands him a black portfolio.

Rusty and Linus watch the entrance: No one enters.

<DIRECTION>
Rusty looks up as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's arm in the New York Times photo) appears. Elegantly dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own private space. And Rusty's face just about drops at the sight of her.

	I don't know if we can use her yet. I haven't even caught her name.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape. Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy.
</DIRECTION>

On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil handles.

Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from ear to ear, happy in his work. He checks a stopwatch in his hand as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open, revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded into a three-by-four foot space. He whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply. Danny checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	29:47. Everything okay in there?

Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him. But Rusty does, appearing behind him.

The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall between a van Gogh and a Monet.

At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby.

Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands transfixed by the painting.

(to Saul, noticing his heavy bet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to get in the hole too heavy to this Benedict. A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g's from the guy. Two months went by, Benedict hadn't heard from him, he calls my friend up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll get to it when I get to it,' my friend says. Half hour later Benedict's in my friend's hotel room, dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet. 'You gonna get to it now?'

	No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you.

Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.

Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault's center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK...

He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes in the room: vacant and silent.

Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.

AT CASINO ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saul, as Lyman Zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking through sliding glass doors out at the valet station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, Terry Benedict approaches, two security guards walking half a pace behind him. Saul spots him in the glass's reflection; he does not turn.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - VALET AREA - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits.
</DIRECTION>
<TURK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Zerga. A gift from Mr. Hesse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TURK>
<DIRECTION>
Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it shut, and hands Saul the key.
</DIRECTION>
<SAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.

He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.

<RACETRACK_DENIZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saul? Saul Bloom, is that you?

Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.

<DIRECTION>
Danny sits in a row of octogenarians, all vacantly dropping $1 coins and pulling levers. As he watches Saul and Benedict disappear into the cage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DING! DING! DING! DING! Four cherries. Danny smiles, a big winner, but he's got bigger pots to win tonight. He steers a neighboring senior citizen (blind as a bat) to his slot machine...

<DIRECTION>
Linus looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Don't use three words when one will do, don't shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don't make him laugh, he's gotta like you then forget you the moment you've left his sight, and for God's sakes whatever you do, don't under any circumstances --

INT. WAREHOUSE - SECOND VAN POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of which, importantly, we never see the exterior, just an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch into the white van's rear and before you can say "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the warehouse fully loaded.

The time is 7:16.

INT. BELLAGIO CAGES - EMPTY COUNT ROOM

The room is empty save for a large table. Saul places his briefcase on it, adjusts its numbered combination locks, and opens it.

Inside the case: five rows of glittering emeralds.

<BENEDICT>

<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you lift them out, please?

Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict pats down the case's interior. Saul replaces the tray.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault. While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault...

Walsh nods, and Benedict turns back to Saul.

<DIRECTION>
RISING FROM a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side-to- side, OVER hands flexing and stretching, UP TO Linus Caldwell. He keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for Benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his nerves. Then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes:

Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his plate, Virgil whips off the cart's tablecloth: underneath it's the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to a corner.

Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the way to the door.

	I resent your implication that race has anything to do with this.

<LINUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My beeper. I'm sorry. I forgot it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINUS>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it.

<BENEDICT>

The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their bluff.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is?

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile: Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of Danny Ocean. The guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds, but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his teeth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... or the lack thereof; the Bruiser doesn't hold a single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. Gum city. And there's something really terrifying about the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like me talking to his girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GOON_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna step outside now. Leave you two alone to talk things over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOON_1>

The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little blood from his lip.

<DANNY>

	Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.

Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart, which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out to grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...

Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he knows: it's time for his leap.

BARRROOOOM! No one is hurt. Nor is the money, stacked neatly in a corridor, ready to be packed into the phony SWAT team bags, body armor, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back. Rusty flips open another cell phone...
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cupping phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
Turk hits the gas and the VEHICLE PEELS away, carrying its cadre of new multi-millionaires far away from the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BELLAGIO VAULT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict squats down to inspect a burnt scrap of paper on the vault floor. It's a flier for a strip joint.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
(and it finally occurs to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ocean...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - MOVING WITH BENEDICT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heated, he approaches the interrogation room, where his Plainclothes Goons keep watch.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Ocean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<PLAINCLOTHES_GOON_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still inside, sir. With Bruiser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAINCLOTHES_GOON_1>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict straightens his cuffs, cools himself, then:
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open that door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bruiser throws a mean left hook across Danny's face as the door swings open and Benedict steps in. Bruiser sees him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict studies Danny: the man is a bloody mess, head rolling, eyes puffed up.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
The Goons step in, slap Danny alert. At last, Danny recognizes Benedict in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little punchy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heya, Benedict... How's the other fight going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict keeps his cool.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have a hand in this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I have a hand in what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing? He looks at Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches Bruiser's eye for just a moment. And barely winks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS. Tess plucks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (if you must know, it's Livingston's)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn to Channel 88.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. Tess does so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On her TV: A security-angle of the cage hallway. The Goons appear, escorting bloodied Danny out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tess gasps, we go live to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAGE/HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Benedict follows the Goons and Danny out, brooding: what's his next step? Walsh approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get robbed or something, Benedict? Geez, that's a shame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict looks up, suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
The Goons stop, spin Danny around to face Benedict.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where. Is. My. Money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
They hold each other's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you say if I told you you could get your money back...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... if you gave up Tess?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would say yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE

She's crestfallen.

INT. CAGE/HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's very interesting...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but I didn't have anything to do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He grins. Benedict sinks.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
(to his Goons)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And contact the police. I would imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation of his parole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE - ON TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Goons haul Danny out. Tess has left, heartbeats ago: the room's door is just closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAGE/HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<WALSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should have held him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALSH>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Follow him. Everywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO FLOOR - OUTSIDE CAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benedict exits. Takes in his casino. It's been a bad night: he's down a hundred fifty million. He starts for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO FLOOR - ELEVATOR BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he arrives, the elevator doors open and Tess steps out. She breezes right past him.
</DIRECTION>
<BENEDICT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tess...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she doesn't stop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENEDICT>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You of all people should know, Terry: in your hotel, there's always someone watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps going. Benedict, now down a hundred fifty million and one woman, boards the elevator. Its doors close on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY/VACANT WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SWAT van rounds a corner and ducks inside the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three-and-a-half seconds pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the eight SWAT members reappear, now all in suits, perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll, single-file and sloppy... right down the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRIP - MOVING WITH THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turk, Livingston, Frank, Basher, Yen, Saul, Linus and Rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they come to an intersection...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Virgil and Reuben, also in suits, fall into stride for a victory lap in front of the Bellagio fountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only two left: Rusty and Linus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They take each other in, shake hands, and part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tess exits, searching for Danny. She rounds the building to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where a LVPD squad car has just arrived to take goon-held Danny away. She runs toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
They do. As Danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading in the back, he and Tess hold each other's glance.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew what I was doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
A cop lowers Danny's head as he directs him into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long will you be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three to six months, I should think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as it pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT GATE - MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great metal gate opens once more, revealing Danny Ocean in its frame again, ready for release.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before. He takes his first step into free America...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall. Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello to you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
They shakes hands. Rusty looks Danny over.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hair's grayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your eyes got closer together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life... is a roomful of pillows.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together again.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you want to go first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To a phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rusty had anticipated this.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stopped and picked up your personal effects, put them in the back seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess sitting in the back. She smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling back, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure these belong to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure they do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rusty get in. Danny kisses Tess. Rusty STARTS the CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to find Rusty a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RUSTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a women's prison just down the road...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSTY>
<DIRECTION>
He drives off. In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you sold this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
As they drive away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow. At the wheel: Benedict's goons.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_END>
