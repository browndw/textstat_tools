	Won't happen again, Mr. C.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener. His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.

STATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming down his face. His opinion on the experience is not decipherable. Ad libs: "Sir, yes, sir."

EXT. THE BOSTON COMMON. DAY

Guys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.

As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues, and walks on.

INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. (Dialog on separate document). Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people looking at him, has made his bones. He's treated with respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look around)...

INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped. Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper. BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the photographs in different ways.

NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY

<DIRECTION>
Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.
</DIRECTION>
<MADOLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Morning.

MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.

</MADOLYN>
<DIRECTION>
He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures, breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're not having this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<MADOLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADOLYN>
<DIRECTION>
MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company.

COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead. A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.

	Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings. BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway, and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around. Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO. DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.
</DIRECTION>
<MISTER_FRENCH>

</MISTER_FRENCH>
<DIRECTION>
MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DELAHUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the forms in there.

<FITZY>

BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an envelope. BILLY gets up.

EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY

BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone vibrates and he takes it out.

INT. CINEMA. NIGHT REVISED ON SET 5/31/05
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Costello is wearing the dildo. He watches the movie, moaning.
</DIRECTION>
<COSTELLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, be dirty.

Colin goes for his gun. Costello gets up, shows him the dildo.

	With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding nothing.

We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello. His idol doesn't like him.

	But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you, that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won't be me who pays for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTELLO>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN nods, sweat on his lip.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this. It involves lying, and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<COSTELLO>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theatre.

Costello gets up to go.

	</DIALOGUE>
</COSTELLO>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see: BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through the emergency exit beside the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CINEMA BACK STAIRCASE AND ALLEY. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone. COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and right, then goes after
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A STREET OF CHINESE SHOPS. CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate to see Colin's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN is halfway down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(And COLIN is aware of the tail)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.
</DIRECTION>
<TEXT_MESSAGE_DETAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make arrest.

</TEXT_MESSAGE_DETAIL>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering) footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner. COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN. COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy, no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks, sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement. BILLY backs away, gets out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY. Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the Shroud of Turin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the door. The chain on.

Billy gets soaked.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave.

MADOLYN takes a moment to react.

	Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<MADOLYN>

</MADOLYN>
<BILLY>

She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..

A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night. One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.

COSTELLO is checking the rearview mirror. He sees: The TWO SIU CARS exit the highway onto Atlantic Avenue. COSTELLO smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cars exit the highway. The cars pass through a maze of industrial streets.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an unfinished structure, the lower parts used, the upper parts accessible but still under construction. It is built on a pier, the harbor lights beyond it. The COMMAND VAN and POLICE CARS pull up with lights off. A TACTICAL VAN disgorges TACTICAL OFFICERS who spread out through the dark.

COSTELLO unlocks a CONTAINER with a construction company logo on it, opens the doors, and steps back. BILLY looks into the container. It's cocaine or heroin in kilo bricks. Men stand around with MP5s under their coats.

<DIRECTION>
INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. NIGHT

FOUR CARS with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as they come out of the garage. COSTELLO realizes that something has gone wrong.

</COSTELLO>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their hands. COLIN is not visible among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE open fire at Costello's car. THE CAR reverses back into the garage. MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up. FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.
</DIRECTION>

<COSTELLO>

</COLIN>
<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve. He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as COLIN shoots him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the dead body again and again. He backs away.

INT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying there on the counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes the string and sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: (COLIN SULLIVAN, 20 Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK), with a return address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide it...she has to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET. And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t- shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn, realizing that something is wrong.

</BILLY>

COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next move. He seems to realize he's fucked.

BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both hear it.

INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY/ELEVATOR. DAY

BILLY moves COLIN into the elevator and as the doors close looks back at BROWN, still in a Mexican stand-off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN, nose broken, blood masking his face.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face, half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the bloody elevator and down at the dead man.

<BROWN>

BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head. COLIN stares at him.

EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

POLICE TAPE, plenty of cars. Three corpses being loaded onto ambulances. COLIN, hands free, is drinking coffee from a paper cup, being checked out by a doctor.

INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NOT MUCH LATER

COLIN has been cleaned up a little by paramedics. He's maybe had his lip stitched, but he's still wearing his bloody clothes.

	At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head.

<DIRECTION>
(drinks water)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired.

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY'S GRAVESITE. The same cemetery as his mother is buried in. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN (not only State, but MDC, the way they do it, for "brother officers"), saluting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MADOLYN is at the gravesite, dry-eyed though in, distinctly apart from COLIN. He looks at her. She looks away from him, apparently forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN squares off: his job in the world is to get ahead. A salute is fired with rifles. But later...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN and MADOLYN are walking through the graves.
</DIRECTION>
<COLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the baby?

She moves away from him without answering. MADOLYN walks out through the cemetery gates. COLIN hesitates.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows, DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has plastic hospital boots on his feet.

<COLIN>

(accepting it, sort of, but only in a COLIN way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLIN>
<DIRECTION>
DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor. DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so it's not in the shot when it

FREEZES.
