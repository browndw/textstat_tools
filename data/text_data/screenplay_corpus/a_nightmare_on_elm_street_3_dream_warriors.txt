Warren Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" BLARES from a radio as we begin a CLOSUP MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - A YOUNG GIRL'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dips a strip of newspaper into a bowl of paper mache mix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - THE WETTED PAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is applied to a paper mache surface, and a popsicle stick is pressed into place. (We are TOO TIGHT to see the object being constructed.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN PARKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen (16) is strikingly pretty, despite the dark, tired circles under her eyes. She's exhausted, but desperately trying to stay awake. She wears pajamas and robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head nods, her eyelids close. She snaps herself awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - THE RADIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the VOLUME UP EVEN LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - THE CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's 1:20 a.m.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - A JAR OF FOLGER'S COFFEE CRYSTALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scoops out a spoonful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the spoonful of coffee crystals in her mouth and chases it down with a swig of Diet Coke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - PAPER MACHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another piece is applied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nodding off again. She rouses herself angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedroom door opens and her mother enters. ELAINE PARKER, late 30's, is dressed in an expensive evening gown that carefully displays her assets. She snaps the radio off.

Kristen does as she's told. Her mother goes to the door and reaches for the light switch.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom? I'm still having these awful dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>

A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine? Where do you keep the bourbon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<ELAINE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ELAINE>
<KRISTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't want to keep him waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTEN>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes, shutting Kristen into darkness. She lies in bed, blinking back angry tears. She turns on her side, her gaze falling on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PAPER MACHE OBJECT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight. A crude, homemade replica of the Elm Street House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring at the tiny house, hearing her mother's FAINT LAUGHTER downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen begins to nod off, though she's fighting it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A breeze starts up, rustling her hair. Leaves fall across her pillow and face. Her mother's LAUGHTER FADES OUT, replaced by the EERIE GIGGLING of small children. She awakes with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, CRANING UP TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen's bed sits in the middle of the dark, deserted street in front of the Elm Street House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small CHILDREN are playing on the lawn. The boys are dressed in suits, the girls in party dresses. They are jumping rope and chanting a singsong:
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, two, Freddy's coming for you, three, four, better lock your door, five, six, grab your crucifix...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDREN>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gets out of bed and approaches the children, transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...except for one eerily pretty LITTLE GIRL sitting on her red tricycle near the front door, hair billowing in the breezes as she stares at Kristen.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<KRISTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kristen. What's yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Little Girl giggles and smiles shyly, but doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTEN>
<DIRECTION>
The wind kicks up, MOANING. We hear the SOUND OF WIND CHIMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WIND CHIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tinkling in the wind. The "chimes" are long razors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door of the house CREAKS open behind the Little Girl. Darkness within.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go now. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
RINGING the bell on the handlebar, she pedals her tricycle through the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Don't go in there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTEN>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Kristen stands alone. Fighting her fear, she approaches the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen enters. The place is barren, empty. Broken windows, flaking paint, rotted walls. Leaves skitter across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KRISTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRISTEN>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHILDREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sense her presence and turn their vacant, staring eyes toward her. They scatter, vanishing into the shadows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the JINGLING of the tricycle bell and the GIGGLING of the Little Girl ECHOING FAINTLY from deep inside the house. Then silence again. Kristen tries to follow the sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen comes around a corner just in time to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quick glimpse of the Little Girl vanishing around the corner at the far end of a long, twisted corridor. The walls are streaked with rust...or perhaps dried blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps following. Being led.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy steel door that is just closing wiht a SOLID METALLIC CLANG. The riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open. A stairway leading down into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BOILER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen fearfully enters Freddy's decrepit lair. Ancient rusted boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOFT JINGLE of the tricycle draws Kristen's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Little Girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop before Kristen.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where he takes us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
There is a SCREECH OF METAL. Kristen whirls and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rusted furnace door is swinging open, metal grating on metal. Inside, the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash. A tricycle lies in the carnage, identical to the Little Girl's -- only charred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified. Suddenly, a METAL DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY in the darkness. THUDDING FOOTSTEPS approach, BOOMING CLOSER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LITTLE GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks up at Kristen with sad eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(eerily calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddy's home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOILER FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now alive with ROARING FLAMES. The tricycle's paint bubbles and scorches in the intense heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scoops the Little Girl into her arms and runs in blind terror. She glances back over her shoulder to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looming from the row of boilers, an indistinct silhouette in the hellish smoke and flames. His maniacal LAUGHTER ECHOES through the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ducks through a doorway into another room, still carrying the Little Girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred teenage bodies hang from the ceiling, strung up in the darkness like butchered meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gazes in horror. She looks down at the Little Girl cradled in her arms -- she is now a horribly charred, brittle corpse. Suddenly, her tiny mouth bursts open, emitting a ghastly, ear-splitting SCREAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOCK CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she sits bolt upright in bed, panting in terror, face bathed in sweat. She looks around, recognizing her own room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT - BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror. Still trembling, she runs water in the sink and splashes her face, trying to calm down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water becomes too hot. Steam rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to turn the water off, but the pressure increases. More Steam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fiddles with the handle, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she turns it, the four-pronged handle suddenly springs to life, grasping her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gasps and looks up. Freddy's face grins out at her from the mirror. She SCREAMS. Steam billows up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SINK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other faucet handle begins to flex and stretch, turning into Freddy's claw hand. Finger razors grow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMING, struggling to break free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leering from the mirror, laughing. The claw hand rises up into frame, poising to slash Kristen's exposed wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMING as the blades slash downward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grinning as a spray of blood hits the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BATHROOM DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bursts open, revealing Kristen's mother. She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - THE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No steam. The mirror and sink are normal...except for the thin streaks of spattered blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen turns to her mother, slowly waking from her dream. She holds a bloody razor in her hand. Her wrist is slashed.
</DIRECTION>

Kristen lies in bed, sketching on a newsprint pad with charcoal. A rendering of the Elm Street House.

Kristen watches, terrified, as a tricycle rolls into the room by itself, leaving bloody tire tracks. The same tricycle that belonged to the Little Girl.

It is the Elm Street living room, foreboding and nearly barren of furniture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and undulates toward her sinuously. A long tubular shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape circles her aimlessly, then slithers up the wall -- a huge, writhing entity traveling within the wall surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below the floorline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen turns about apprehensively, searching for the mysterious entity. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the creature erupts through the floor directly beneath her in a shower of wood splinters, engulfing her legs as it rockets straight up. It slams back down like a whale surfacing, Kristen locked firmly in its jaws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE

is a gigantic serpent/worm version of Freddy, ribbed and organic, encrusted with mucous and slime. Its slavering jaws dislocate like a snake's, the skin stretching grotesquely as it begins to swallow Kristen from the legs up.

BOOM UP TO the marionettes hanging on the wall. An eerie collection of moonlit figures.
</DIRECTION>

DOLLY IN FOR CLOSEUP on the unfinished marionette. It raises its gray, misshapen head.

The crude clay features ripple and change into a distinct likeness of Freddy.

Too deeply. Joey gags and draws back -- but Marcie's tongue grows supernaturally long and burrows deeper into his mouth.

A second hideously long tongue shoots out of her mouth, throught the air --

Four huge razors slash through the canvas -- RIIIIIIP! Cotton padding flies.

Cotton padding billows through the air as the razors slash through the wall again and again -- from in front, from behind, from the side, from the floor, from everywhere.

The Quiet room becomes a white void of ripping and slashing -- a vicious blizzard of whirling padding.

ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY OUT to reveal Kristen sitting at her drafting table in her bedroom at home. The crude paper mache Elm Street House model is in front of her, still under construction. Warren Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" still blares from the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing has changed. She's still home. Safe. She wonders if all of it, everything, has been nothing but a bad dream.

Her mother enters, dressed in the same beautiful evening gown, and snaps the radio off.

Suddenly, Elaine is violently yanked out the door, revealing:

FREDDY

</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>

KRISTEN

SCREMING in bed.

Kristen turns and runs, Freddy right on her heels, his finger blades mere inches from her back.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

Kristen's momentum takes her right up the wall -- she pushes off in an incredible gymnast's flip, hurtling up in an arc back over Freddy's head -- Freddy hits the wall, his finger-razors burying deep in the plaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
makes a perfect landing near her bed and snatches up her bedspread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
howls with rage and yanks his razors from the wall in an explosion of plaster. he whirls and dives at Kristen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as she flings the bedspread over him. He tangles up, going down hard, thrashing to get free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRISTEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurtles herself out the window in an explosion of glass.
</DIRECTION>

Ripping and slashing, he wrestles the bedspread off and hurls it away in tatters. He looks around, howling with rage.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

Freddy leaps from the darkness, blades flashing.

Taryn nimbly dodges and whirls, producing two large gravity knives. She click-clacks them open, twirling them expertly.

	Okay asshole. Let's dance.

Taryn ducks and cuts deeply across Freddy's ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy SCREAMS with anger and swipes twice more, ripping deep gouges in Taryn's shoulder.

Taryn draws back, keeping her guard up. She feints, then strikes out, slashing Freddy again.

This time Freddy draws back.

Revolted by the weird display. She looks down, feeling something strange.

As their inner plunges depress, Taryn's biceps swell grotesquely, veins bulging impossibly.

We can actually see the high-pressure fluid travel upward as her veins and body balloon, racing from her arms -- her neck swells -- temples expand -- eyeballs bulge --

He hears a SOUND somewhere in the darkness ahead. He pauses...nothing. Suddenly, there's a SOUND OF SCREECHING METAL and a strange object comes racing out of the darkness at him. He lunges out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OBJECT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screeches to a halt and wheels about. It's an oversiezed, nightmarish version of Will's wheelchair -- made of rusty, twisted metal and bristling with spikes and hooks. To sit in it would be agonizing death.

With a cry, she runs and does a double flip over the burning pit -- right at Freddy.

THE THRONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kristen snap-kicks right into Freddy's face, toppling him and the throne backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KINCAID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
strains as he rips a six-foot section of pipe from the wall and races toward the throne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NANCY

helps Joey to his feet just as a tongue/creature flies out of the darkness and whips around her neck, strangling her.
</DIRECTION>

FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rises from the rubble of his throne and lashes at Kristen. She flips over his head -- but Freddy backhands her, sending her spinning across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NANCY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching one end of the writhing tongue, she forces it to the ground. She grabs a furnace poker and skewers the creature. It instantly unravels from her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FALLEN THRONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Freddy prepares to slash Kristen, Kincaid races in, swinging his pipe in a wide arc. It smashes across Freddy's back, driving him to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kincaid raises the pipe for a second blow, but Freddy leaps up with a ROAR and grabs Kincaid, hauling him high over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nancy rushes in just as Freddy's arms are extended and plunges the poker into his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks down at the poker with an exaggerated gasp -- then flashes a grin at Nancy.

NANCY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
releases Kincaid's feet and holds him dangling by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his free hand, he pulls the poker slowly from his chest. He looks at the tip -- it glistens with dark, rancid gore. He licks it like an ice cream cone.

NEIL AND THOMPSON
</DIRECTION>

More MUSIC comes from all around them, blasting from the radios of long-dead autos, a cacophony of rock songs from the 50's and 60's. We hear the HOWLING of Wolfman Jack.
</DIRECTION>

Broken headlights sputter to life. A windshield wiper near Thompson slaps madly back and forth across shattered glass. Horns honk. An exposed fan blade WHIRRS like a buzzsaw.

Neil hurries over and grabs the sack to throw it into the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a skeletal hand wearing finger-razors tears through the rotted burlap and latches onto Neil's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sack rips wide open as Freddy's charred bones leap into life -- a hideous shambling skeleton SCREAMING with unearthly rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMPSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen to the spot. Can't believe his eyes.

NEIL

Suddenly, Jesse the junkyard dog hurtles out of the darkness onto the hellish thing's back, biting and snapping.

The skeleton pulls the dog from its back, slashes its throat in one quick motion, and tosses the carcass aside.

Thompson slams into it, impaled on the tail fin. He looks down at the metal point jutting from his chest...and dies.

<DIRECTION>
NEIL

<DIRECTION>
grabs the shovel and swings it -- the skeleton ducks and slashes Neil's ribs, ripping his shirt wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Neil doubles over, the skeleton rips the shovel from his hands and smashes it solidly against his head. Before Neil can crumple, the creature straightens him up with a second vicious blow -- we hear BONE CRACK. Neil falls back into the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skeleton shrieks with unholy laughter and begins to shovel the loose dirt onto Neil.
</DIRECTION>

It tosses the shovel aside, raises its arms into the air with a victorious HOWL -- and collapses into a pile of bones.
