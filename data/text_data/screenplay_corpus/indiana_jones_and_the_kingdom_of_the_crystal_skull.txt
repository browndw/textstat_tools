:SC: INDIANA JONES IV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling, fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the fly, deciding whether or not to bite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD. A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake, surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the entire area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face. CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his catch.

A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE.

INDIANA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny, bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache. MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.

Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back to shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING... their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES to MacGowan.

</MACGOWAN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance, as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock. The villagers WHISPER among themselves.

The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers, lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small, flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to the castle's upstairs window.

	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin' in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING himself to be strong.

<DIRECTION>
As each man is called, the color LEAVES his face. The chosen policemen RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND. WAITING. The elderly woman KISSES the crucifix that hangs from her neck. She STARES at the departing men.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CASTLE DOORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons, serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window. The candle still FLICKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS, holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.
</DIRECTION>
<HENNESEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could a human bein' survive?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENNESEY>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT. MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.

<DIRECTION>
Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance. Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their pistols. They FOLLOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room in ORANGE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh has SOBSIDED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!

THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES. MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the others to FOLLOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN with their every move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing! FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY. MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.
</DIRECTION>
<MACGOWAN>

They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large, MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS. There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the liquid. He TASTES.

Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS. Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening. He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an order to his men.

</MACGOWAN>
<DIRECTION>
MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRYPT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes. Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER. Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by his feet, is the DEAD BODY of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.

Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.
</DIRECTION>
<BOTTOMLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open the door!

Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK, another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.

Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy TURNS from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bottomley?...

<DIRECTION>
NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.

<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bottomley?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a SHOCKING SIGHT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt. There is NO SIGN of anyone.

<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?... Who's there?...

The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!

Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back his hand. His fingers are BURNT.

Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING HIS GRIP.

Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy SWINGS DOWNWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABYSS

<DIRECTION>
At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge SNAPS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOW they bite!

</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND. Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other... and Indy's HEAD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE. He's going to DROWN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE. But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS. CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet. He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair. Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense. Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.

<DIRECTION>
The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY. TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG Indy to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to the scene before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack. For a MOMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He RUNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths FOAMING.
</DIRECTION>

Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The dog is TRAPPED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window. The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!

A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES. Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>

</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone crunching grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head. The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both knights FALLING to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight armed with a long, sharp SWORD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the room!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE. Indiana JUMPS to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK! The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward. Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME! SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white knight COMES toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows. Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF to a freshly carved slice of pork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the chandelier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED, Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery throat. Indiana SNARLS.
</DIRECTION>

Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork. His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the flame of the mysterious candle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him. Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED and TATTERED Indiana Jones.

The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD.

INDY'S POV

<DIRECTION>
Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle. Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a GHOST!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE expression on Indy's face.

Early AFTERNOON. A RAINY Spring day. Students RUN to the University doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INDIANA JONES' OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain SPLATTERS the window of this cramped, CLUTTERED room. Crooked stacks of dog eared TEXTBOOKS and PAPERS nearly reach the ceiling. The spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various ARCHEOLOGICAL RELICS and INSTRUMENTS: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues, etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of TERM PAPERS, is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three piece suit and circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a STUDENT SEAT ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term papers. He furiously GRADES each paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To make matters worse; the office is CROWDED WITH STUDENTS, with countless others POURING out into the hallway. All of the students are ANXIOUS to get inside. They are BADGERING, COMPLAINING and MOANING at Indy.

Indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to IGNORE the verbal assault. BETSY TUFFET pushes her way to the front. Betsy is Indy's STUDENT ASSISTANT. She is 21 YEARS OLD, with thick, luxurious black hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. Betsy is a TOUGH. BRASH. A BROOKLYN kid. She moves CLOSE to Indy, her hair brushing his cheek. Indiana is very TENSE, continuously working on the term papers.

A burly POSTMAN stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous BROWN ENVELOPE. Indy MOTIONS to the postman. The Postman tries to MAKE his way through the crowd. Indiana goes back to his grading, but is suddenly INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD TAPPING NOISE. He LOOKS UP. DEAN CLAUDE COVENTRY, a stately, elderly gentleman, RAPS a steel ruler on Indiana's desk. The Dean is UPSET. Very SERIOUS.

The students exchange STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy.

His face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES.

<DIRECTION>
The papers are slightly CRUMPLED. Still WET. A DROP OF WATER hits the papers. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. BETSY TUFFET, Indy's student assistant, sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that evening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags. His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase. Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at Indy.

Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to READ, making a few CORRECTIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair. Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor.

Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink this. You'll feel better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE her body with the liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match, moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the shoulders.

Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section of BOOKSHELVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly around Indiana.

Hurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face.

EXT. CENTRAL MOZAMBIQUE - BEIRA - A HOT, SUNNY AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS, SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story, low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY'S POV - THE DOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way. A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word "TAXI" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Upon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCRAGGY BRIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough, unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS...

Indy RESTS Scraggy back onto the ramp. Scraggy MOVES to assist Indiana with his luggage. Before picking it up, Scraggy RAISES his arms over the baggage. Again, he BLESSES the suitcases. Scraggy then PICKS UP the bags. Indy CHUCKLES.

Indy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see that this is the SLEEVE OF A GERMAN SOLDIER. CAMERA STOPS on the face of

SGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG

A thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE. STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER. Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.

Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat.

Indiana GRUMBLES. An amused Dr. Clarke gets back into the car. Indy SHOVES Betsy inside. He is FURIOUS.

Before Indiana gets into the car, GUTTERBUHG steps out from the alleyway. He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.

INT. HOTEL

<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door with a key and ENTERS.

INT. ROOM

<DIRECTION>
A SMALL, MUSTY Hotel room. It is furnished with a SINGLE BED, A SOFA, TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A SECRET NAZI HEADQUARTERS. The room is filled with various COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT and RADIO TRANSMITTERS. SEVERAL NAZI SOLDIERS are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An enormous GLASS PANEL covers one wall. THROUGH THE PANEL WE SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SPEEDBOATS. LONG. SLEEK. HIGH POWERED. MAHOGANY HULLED. Both speedboats are adorned with a SWASTIKA. They FLOAT in water, in an UNDERGROUND, MAN-MADE CHAMBER. Directly BESIDE the speedboats, parked on a STONE INCLINE, are

TWO AUTOMOBILES. The cars are enormous, beautiful "WOODIES". Equipped with a RUNNING BOARD and WOOD PANELLED SIDES. The cars GLISTEN. BRAND NEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner. Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused by the movement of his arm.

Indiana ENTERS with Clare, Betsy and Scraggy. The persistant Betsy is ANNOYING Indy. She attempts to SNUGGLE closer to him. Indiana PUSHES her away. Betsy TRIES to hold his hand. Indy SHAKES her loose. Scraggy WATCHES all of this, GIGGLING to himself.

We hear SINGING. A high, pitched BEAUTIFUL VOICE. Clare walks to the far end of the compound, toward the SINGING. The others FOLLOW. Betsy walks by BONZO, A LARGE CHIMPANZEE. As Betsy PASSES, the chimp catches a FAMILIAR SMELL. Bonzo begins to FOLLOW Betsy.

Betsy's foot CONTINUES to rub Indiana's leg. Finally Indy reaches down, trying to SLAP Betsy's foot away! But Indy's hand STUMBLES upon something else. The MECHANICAL BUG. Indy TRIES to remove the bug. But the tiny device WON'T BUDGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE TABLE

Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the bug. To Clare, it appears as if Indy is PLAYING with Betsy's foot. Clare gives an INCREDULOUS look to Indiana.

INT. COMPOUND

<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg, Klaus and Helmut LEAD the bound and gagged Tyki OUT OF THE COMPOUND. They keep their LUGERS at his back. Suddenly, Klaus TRIPS over something. A FAWN. Klaus GROWLS. He SHOUTS a German order to Helmut, who GRABS a tight hold of the baby deer. Klaus AIMS his luger at the fawn's head. Gutterbuhg and Helmut exchange a chilling LAUGH. Tyki stares in HORROR. Klaus CLICKS the luger...ready to SHOOT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an earth shattering CRACK! A WHIP SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the luger! TEARING the gun OUT of Klaus' hand! The fawn breaks FREE and RUNS OFF. The Nazis exchange a SHOCKED glance. They TURN and SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIANA JONES! He stands a FEW FEET away. Holding the WHIP. Indiana POINTS to Tyki, angrilly SHOUTING to the Nazis.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>

</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg LAUGES. He POINTS his finger at Indiana. Indy is PUZZLED. The finger begins to SHOOT! RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE! Indy DIVES for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Tyki CAPTIVE, the Nazis TURN and begin to RUN out of the compound. Indy gets to his FEET. He LIFTS his gun. Ready to SHOOT. But the Nazis are running behind SEVERAL ROWS OF CAGES, filled with ANIMALS. Indiana CAN'T SHOOT. He dashes back OUTSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Located on the WATERFRONT. Countless rows of LONG, WOODEN DOCKS line the marina. The Nazis run to below a ROTTED, ANCIENT DOCK. Here, one of their SPEEDBOATS waits. Motor RUNNING. RUDOLPH, a pudgy Nazi, is at the wheel. The Nazis hurriedly CLIMB into the speedboat, PUSHING Tyki inside with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy RUNS to Scraggy's Model-T. Scraggy SITS in the driver's seat. Betsy and Clare SIT in the rear. A drunk Betsy still sings "Night and Day". Indy leaps onto the SIDEBOARD. He SEES the Nazis ahead, CLIMBING into the speedboat. Indy motions for Scraggy to DRIVE. FAST. TOWARD the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nazi speedboat SHOOTS FORWARD. Moving BENEATH the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scraggy's Model-T FOLLOWS ABOVE, along the SHAKY dock. Indiana RIDES the car's rusted sideboard. He SEES the speedboat below, through the WIDE OPENINGS in the dock's slated boards. Indy begins to SHOOT at the Nazis. Gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm, FIRING SHOTS back at Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machine gun fire SPLINTERS the dock boards, SLICING through the Model-T. The side mirror is BLASTED to pieces. The floor beneath Betsy and Clare erupts with FLYING BULLETS. JUST MISSING the girls. Clare is HORRIFIED. Betsy laughs HYSTERICALLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Model-T is less than TWENTY FEET from the end of the dock. If they continue ahead, the car will PLUNGE SEVERAL FEET INTO THE WATER! But Scraggy doesn't take his FOOT from the gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUTTERBUHG smiles, seeing the vast ocean ahead. Knowing he's almost FREE.
</DIRECTION>

As he DODGES bullets, Indiana SEES the end of the dock ahead. He SHOUTS to Scraggy.

<DIRECTION>
Scraggy NODS. The end of the dock is only a FEW FEET ahead. Getting CLOSER... CLOSER... Clare COVERS her eyes. Between hiccups, Betsy laughingly SINGS. Indy LOOKS to the speedboat... BACK to the approaching dock edge... He PAUSES... WAITING for the right moment... He SCREAMS!
</DIRECTION>

The speedboat SHOOTS OUT from beneath the dock! Indiana LANDS DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE SPEEDBOAT! A SPECTACULAR STUNT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helmut POINTS his gun at Indy. Indy reacts with a SWIFT KICK to Helmut's jaw. The Nazi HITS the deck. OUT COLD. Klaus COMES for Indy. They begin to FIGHT. An angry Gutterbuhg tries to SHOOT... But Indy and Klaus move TOO QUICKLY! Gutterbuhg CAN'T get a clear shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Model-T has COME TO A STOP. SAFE. Its front wheels TEETER over the dock's edge. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare GET OUT. Clare CATCHES her breath. Knees SHAKING. Betsy is still LAUGHING.

Scraggy RUNS OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER... toward a SPINNING DEATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE PROPELLERS!
</DIRECTION>

Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY. Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.

There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound. Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DASHIELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scraggy said you might be needing some help, sport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DASHIELL>
<DIRECTION>
Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO Nazi headquarters for help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DASHIELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy! Rollout!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DASHIELL>
<DIRECTION>
Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat. Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into the pole! CRUSHED!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DASHIELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, sport?

Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS.

<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dash!...

</INDIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck. The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIANA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK. His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to BREAK THE CONNECTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind. Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip. Only a FEW THREADS remain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING. JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind. Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has met a GRISLY DEATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength! Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure of the rushing water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something. AHEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships move CLOSER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE OPENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and SMALLER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER... Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES between the two Ocean Liners!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from strangling Indiana. They TURN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS. Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are SPLATTERED through the night sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion. Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck, catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore. Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS. Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that pierces the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.

EXT. ZAMBESI RIVER - THE FOLLOWING DAY

Early MORNING. The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the "ADOBO", travels along the Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS. They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR, singing a FOLK SONG.

INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters. CLARE exits from a cabin, carrying a stenographer's NOTEBOOK. She looks RADIANT. Her red hair SHIMMERS in the morning sun. Clare walks up BESIDE Indy. She CRINKLES her nose.

INDIANA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

He LEAPS out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin lamp. The intruder is none other than...BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.

They KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a PASSIONATE KISS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM. An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers her face.

THE FOLLOWING MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.

The hand GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES
</DIRECTION>

AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK. FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet. THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of the kitchen.

Indiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED. UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He still tries to REASON with Clare.

Clare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket. ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head.
</DIRECTION>
<INDIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a respected...honored... admired...

Clare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and Clare TURN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED, they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear- like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD. ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PIRATE SHIP

KEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat, to the Pirate Ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.
</DIRECTION>

Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS and FLYING ARROWS.

The swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY. Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill. He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy gives her a THANKFUL NOD.

The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall.

CAMERA PULLS BACK. All of the Pirates SLEEP. Their slumbering bodies LIE in various positions, throughout the cave. Indiana and Kezure are STILL AWAKE. The flickering orange light of the TORCHES illuminates the wall in front of them. They AWAIT the lowering tide. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare SLEEP on the ground beside them. Kezure POURS two glasses of whiskey from a STONE BOTTLE. He gives a GLASS to Indiana. Kezure TOASTS.

EXT. JUNGLE PLAINS - THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>

Scraggy's decrepid MODEL-T TAXI putters across the flat, jungle terrain. The HOT SUN shines in the background. The car is completely PACKED with people. Ready to BURST. Scraggy DRIVES. Indiana, Clare and Betsy are CROWDED in the front seat. Kezure and four Pirates ride in the REAR COMPARTMENT. Everyone is UNCOMFORTABLE. CRAMPED. SWEATING. Two of Scraggy's crew members STRADDLE the sideboard. Three men sit on the ROOF, including the GUITAR PLAYER, who plays a delightful melody. Various rusted POTS, PANS and other UTENSILS dangle from the car. This creates a CHARMING, JINGLING sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The taxi passes a HERD OF GIRAFFE. The beautiful animals stare in BEWILDERMENT at the passing taxi. Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND. The same LOW, RUMBLING we heard earlier. The giraffes SCATTER. AFRAID of the unnatural sound.

A TRIBE OF NATIVE WARRIORS appear on the terrain. There are HUNDREDS. SCREAMING in high pitched squeals. Their bodies ADORNED with red and white PAINT. The angry warriors RUN TOWARD the taxi. FIRING ARROWS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the Taxi roof, the men DIVE for cover. Arrows WHIZ by their heads. Inside, everyone ROLLS UP the windows. The taxi is attacked with a SHOWER OF ARROWS. Scraggy FLOORS the gas. The taxi keeps MOVING AHEAD. SPEEDING toward the jungle. Indiana GLARES at Kezure.

The WARRIORS continue to CHASE the Taxi. Getting CLOSER. Firing more ARROWS. The taxi SPINS to a stop. Directly in front of a LARGE OPENING that leads into the jungle. Everyone POURS OUT of the Taxi. ARROWS fly by their heads. They DASH through the opening. Into the JUNGLE. The Warriors STOP. OUTSIDE of the opening. They DON'T ENTER. TURNING to each other, they begin to LAUGH. VICTORIOUS.

One of the Pirates CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. His foot TRIPS A THIN STRING that stretches across the path. WHOOSH! A BOOBY TRAPPED PALM TREE SWINGS FORWARD! It SLAMS into the Pirate! Like a giant BASEBALL BAT! It sends the Pirate FLYING UPWARD. HIGH INTO THE AIR! His body is THROWN several feet into the jungle.

Indiana LEADS everyone. They CREEP through the path. Indy PAUSES. CAMERA PANS TO HIS WAIST. A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path. ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE! The vine SNAPS. There is a CREAKING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS A CORNER... They COME UPON...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS. Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT. SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out. CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY. Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST. The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS. FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING.

Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS.

At that moment, directly behind Scraggy and Indy, the jungle ERUPTS! The trees SEPARATE. CRASHING to the ground. Making way for some GIANT BEHEMOTH. Scraggy and the others LEAP IN ONE DIRECTION. Indiana LEAPS IN ANOTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG. Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL, is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON. Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND LEVEL.

The tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground.

Indiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino CHASES him!

The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm trees to smithereens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering, Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The tank FOLLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle, the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank. HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.
</DIRECTION>

Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT. They run toward a RAVINE.

Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE. Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree.

Indiana continues to FIGHT the Nazis, along the SECOND LEVEL of the frenzied tank. Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to the machine guns.

In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk. Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.

Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone PANICS. Betsy SHOUTS.

CRUSHED.

His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES. The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from the tank.

The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT.

The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla. The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS. UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns, seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE. They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank. Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki.

Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket, RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people. The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM, ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward. Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward the MOUNTAIN TOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND THE CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and the others are met with an AWESOME SIGHT! Indy STOPS. His mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!

THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG

LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall. PASSAGEWAY into the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki, approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues to REPEAT a certain phrase.

Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing light.

WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE. ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING him home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his bindings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING. The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.
</DIRECTION>

Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes. Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the others.

Indiana exchanges a HOPEFUL glance with Clare. As Bohbala CONTINUES to speak, CAMERA PANS TO GUTTERBUHG. The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his mechanical arm.

Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING! Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.

Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL! But NONE of the villagers listen. Indiana LOOKS to his SHOCKED friends.

Indiana, armed with a shield, sword and pistol, LEADS his troops forward. The Nazis are APPROACHING. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the front jeep, which is mounted with a large RECOILIST MACHINE GUN. The entire Nazi army is BEHIND HIM. Mephisto's jeep begins to CROSS the drawbridge. Moving TOWARD Indiana and the others. The recoilist machine gunner OPENS FIRE on Indy and the troops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets BOUNCE from Indy's shield. Several of the pygmies are HIT. FALLING to the drawbridge. An angry pygmy THROWS his spear. It HITS the machine gunner. THROUGH the heart.

The jeep continues to DRIVE FORWARD. HEADED straight for Indiana, who LEAPS ONTO the jeep's hood. Indy's troops SPLIT INTO GROUPS. Dashing around the speeding jeep to BATTLE the oncoming Nazis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana CRAWLS along the jeep hood. TOWARD the Nazis. Mephisto attempts to SHOOT Indy. The bullets ZIP through the windshield. WHIZZING by Indy's head. Indiana GRABS Mephisto. He PULLS the Nazi over the windshield. Indiana and Mephisto TUMBLE along the jeep's hood. FIGHTING. STRUGGLING for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jeep DIRECTLY BEHIND Mephisto is filled with several CRATES OF DYNAMITE. GUTTERBUHG, back in uniform, rides here with THREE NAZI SOLDIERS. As the pygmy troops come forward, Gutterbuhg EXTENDS HIS MECHANICAL ARM. He ZAPS several of the pygmies. KILLING them with deadly JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY.

Mephisto ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT Indiana. But Indy PUSHES AWAY the Nazi's arm. The gun FIRES. HITTING the jeep driver, who SLUMPS over the wheel. The speeding jeep SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. It FLIPS. Sending Indiana and Mephisto FLYING through the air. They TUMBLE to the ground. The jeep CRASHES into a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHAKEN Indiana gets to his feet. Mephisto LIES A few feet away. OUT COLD. Suddenly, a BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BURSTS INTO FRAME! SPARKING the ground beside Indiana. Indy TURNS and sees GUTTERBUBG! The Nazi's jeep has ENTERED the city. Gutterbuhg POINTS his mechanical arm toward Indy. ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SHOCK ejects from his finger. Indy DIVES. The shock TEARS A SMOLDERING HOLE through the building behind him. Only INCHES above Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the Nazis begin to UNLOAD the dynamite from Gutterbubg's jeep. They UNWRAP a long, section of FUSE from a large coil. Placing the fuse ALONG THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana is RUNNING for his life. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND him. In HOT PURSUIT. The Nazi continuously FIRES ELECTRICAL SHOTS at Indiana. The thin lines of electricity WHIZ by Indy's HEAD.

A NAZI TANK

A GROUP OF GORILLAS are beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS, MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP!

INT. CITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE. It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful electrical blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof. Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall. FOLLOWING Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE... FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi RELIGHTS the fuse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop, between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT. Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any second!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY, revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS.

Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds' screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM. The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy.

The pirates fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for him. The Pirate King DISAPPEARS beneath the water surface. A few of his men PAUSE. WORRIED. AFRAID. Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin. Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames continue to SINK.

Mephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the coliseum stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM! Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being CRUSHED by the heavy bells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.

Indy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind. The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS DIRECTLY OVER the pit.

But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the countless TIGERS.

The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.

Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into the waiting tigers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs. He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED. His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell. This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...

Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL. Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.

Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.

A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS.

FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall.

<DIRECTION>
He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS.

Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS. Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is PUZZLED by the bright sunlight.

Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy.

Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden. Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small, glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy.

THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING. Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the still body of Indiana.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be here to share this with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARE>
<DIRECTION>
The pygmies begin to LOWER the dead bodies, including Indiana and Bohbala, into the ground. Tyki reads from ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. Scraggy SOBS on the shoulder of Kezure, who continues to stare in ASTONISHMENT at the peach trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND. Followed by a slight, TREMOR. The trees begin to SWAY, as a HOWLING WIND rushes through them. The tomb of Sun Wu Kung GLOWS with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The glass surrounding the tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES. Beginning to MOVE. The skeleton STEPS OUT OF THE TOMB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone STARES in awe. TERRIFIED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skeleton takes a FEW STEPS forward, STOPS, and RAISES its arms. HIGH in the air. The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED ...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air. The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing SMALLER. THINNER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES. His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves. He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS. His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.

<DIRECTION>
A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through. The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree. He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies, there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has been RESTORED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES. But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.

Sun Wu Kung again RAISES his arms. Green ECOTPLASM again emanates from his fingers. The individual strands of HAIR fly from his body. In a reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair FLY through the air. They grow LARGER...LARGER...until they resume the shape of the GORILLAS.
</DIRECTION>

Sun Wu Kung has RETURNED to his skeletal form. He TURNS and WALKS back to his resting place. The pieces of broken glass RE-ASSEMBLE. SEALING the tomb.

Kezure, his pockets STUFFED with peaches, hurriedly REJOINS the others. Tyki EMBRACES Bohbala, glad to have his Father ALIVE. Bohbala, resuming his position as Ruler, LEADS HIS PEOPLE out of the garden. Indiana, CLUTCHING his golden hooped prize, EXITS with the others.

Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas CHEER for their departing friends.

Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST. They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in front of him. He SMILES at Indiana.

The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members. Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN.
</DIRECTION>

The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR.

Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground.
