A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey on horseback. He looks anxious.

INT. NORLAND PARK - MR. DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured. Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes never leaving his face.

	Shh, hush, Henry.

</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elinor will try to look after you all, but make sure she finds a good husband. The men are such noodles hereabouts, little wonder none has pleased her.

</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
They smile at each other. MRS. DASHWOOD is just managing to conceal her fear and grief
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Marianne is sure to find her storybook hero.

	A romantic poet with flashing eyes and empty pockets?

<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Margaret will go to sea and become a pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every feature.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son is arrived from London, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
MR. DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand.

<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me speak to John alone.

She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite tenderness.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, my dear. How happy you have made me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes her place by the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
MR. DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to whisper with desperate intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John you will find out soon enough from my will that the estate of Norland was left to me in such a way as prevents me from dividing it between my families.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm yourself, Father. This is not good for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
But MR. DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Norland in its entirety is therefore yours by law and I am happy for you and Fanny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected delight.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls' dowries. You must help them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind them is the ominous rustling of parchments.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MR_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must promise to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural hypocrisy.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise, Father, I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
MR. DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes. JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find the DOCTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come! Come quickly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
But it is we who share the dying man's last words.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNY>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dearest, I mean to give them three thousand pounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The interest will provide them with a little extra income. Such a gift will certainly discharge my promise to my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, without question! More than amply...

</FANNY>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little.

JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the final adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting for a tip.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred pounds a year to their mother while she lives. Would that be more advisable? It is better than parting with the fifteen hundred all at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if she should live longer than fifteen years we would be completely taken in. People always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are they coming to live at Norland? They already have a house in London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because houses go from father to son, dearest not from father to daughter. It is the law.

Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.

	Twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise, you are quite right.

</JOHN>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. Although to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNY>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

The entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present. BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence. Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with resentment. MRS. DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity. ELINOR tries to play hostess.

	Fortunate girl. At least she can escape Fanny, which is more than any of us is able.

	Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact that he will not be with us for long, I wondered if Miss Margaret would mind giving up her room to him the view is quite incomparable from her windows and I should so much like Edward to see Norland at its best.

Everyone except MARGARET is present. EDWARD has just shaken bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY's pro prietorial air.
</DIRECTION>
<FANNY>

	But where is Miss Margaret? I declare, Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt of her existence! She must run positively wild!

	Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest is not to be found this morning. She is a little shy of strangers at present.

FANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with interest.

<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.

</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to divert her.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.

<FANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

EDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings and she passes on unsuspecting.

<DIRECTION>
JOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS. DASHWOOD sits across from FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles but looks away quickly.

EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful, rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away, embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner: ECF.

	Why so grave? Do you disapprove her choice?

MARIANNE thinks for a little.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can he love her? Can the ardour of the soul really be satisfied with such polite, concealed affections? To love is to burn to be on fire, all made of passion, of adoration, of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or Guinevere or Heloise.

<MRS_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They made rather pathetic ends, dear.

	I think that may be taking your romantic sensibilities a little far.

FANNY lowers her voice confidingly.

<FANNY>

	You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward is entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can prey--and having entered into any kind of understanding, he would never go back on his word. He is quite simply incapable of doing so. But it would lead to his ruin. I worry for him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial support from Edward, should he choose to plant his affections in less... exalted ground than he deserves.

<DIRECTION>
As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy- complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir John!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly fascinated by his bouncy companion.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my word, here you are, here you are, here you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir John, your extraordinary kindness--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, none of that, hush, please, none of that, but here is my dear mamma- in-law Mrs Jennings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the journey tolerable, you poor souls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you not come up to the Park first and take your ease? We saw you pass--Like many people who live rather lonely lives together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
SIR JOHN and MRS. JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each other all the time and never listen.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--but I would not wait for you to come to us, I made John call for the carriage--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She would not wait, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--as we get so little company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I feel as if I know you already-- delightful creatures!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delightful! And you know you are to dine at Barton Park every day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot--

</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall not brook refusals. I am quite deaf to 'em, you know--

<MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	--deaf--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>

MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But I insist!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't bear 'em, embarrassing, you know--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will send game and fruit as a matter of course--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	--and the carriage is at your beck and call--

MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--call--and here is Miss Marianne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you disappear to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I declare you are the loveliest girl I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must not leave it too long!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, alas, there are no smart young men hereabouts to woo them--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--not a beau for miles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to tell on MRS. DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Mother, let us leave them in peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there is Colonel Brandon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
SIR JOHN is dragging her down the path.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent fellow! We served in the East India Regiment together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just wait till he sees you! If we can persuade him out to meet you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reclusive individual. But you are fatigued. I can see that you are fatigued.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Now he is pushing her into the carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she is fatigued!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come along, Mother, we really must leave them to themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must get your maidservant to make you up some camphor--it is the best tonic for the staggers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send Thomas to us for the carriage when you are ready!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
They take off, waving wildly. MARGARET goes down the path to watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like them.

MARIANNE and ELINOR are getting undressed for bed. it's very cold. They keep their underclothing on and get in, shivering at the bony chill of the linen.

MARIANNE looks out of the window at the wild countryside. Uncon sciously, one hand plays up and down on the sill as though it were a keyboard.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

ELINOR sits at a little desk counting money and making notes. BETSY enters to clean out the fire. She notices the money.

CLOSE on MRS. DASHWOOD looking out of the window, thinking. She remembers MRS. JENNINGS's words:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a beau for miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>

MRS. DASHWOOD turns into the room to look at her brood. ELINOR and MARIANNE are mending MARGARET's petticoats. CLOSE on the mother's anxious expression--what is to become of them?

INT. BARTON PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on an empty chair and place setting. Pull out to reveal the DASHWOODS at their first dinner with SIR JOHN and MRS. JENNINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county--he is bound to do for one of you. Mind, he is a better age for Miss Dashwood--but I dare say she left her heart behind in Sussex, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern at her sister, which MRS. JENNINGS notices.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I think I have unearthed a secret!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oho! Have you sniffed one out already, Mother? You are worse than my best pointer, Flossie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh immoderately. ELINOR tries to stay calm.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood? Is he butcher, baker, candlestick- maker? I shall winkle it out of you somehow, you know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's horribly good at winkling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in lonely country now, Miss Dashwood, none of us has any secrets here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--or if we do, we do not keep them for long!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR tries to smile. MARIANNE looks furious. MARGARET is staring at MRS. JENNINGS as if she were some particularly thrilling form of wildlife.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is curate of the parish, I dare say!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or a handsome lieutenant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he in uniform?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has no profession!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
SIR JOHN and MRS. JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight. ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS. DASHWOOD look at each other helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No profession! A gentleman, then!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Margaret, you know perfectly well there is no such person.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is! There is! And his name begins with an F!

</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR looks hard at her plate.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Margaret!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS. JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	F indeed! A very promising letter. Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word, but I cannot think of a single name beginning with F--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS. JENNINGS are so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>

(controlled fury)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir John, might I play your pianoforte?

</MARIANNE>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, yes--my goodness. We do not stand on ceremony here, my dear.

For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back, slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brandon! Where have you been? Come, come and meet our beautiful new neighbours!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a pity you are late, Colonel! You have missed the most delightful singing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A great pity, indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear friend Colonel Brandon? We served together in the East Indies and I assure you there is no better fellow on earth--

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you really been to the East Indies, Colonel?

But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear.

	<DIALOGUE>
	As for you, you have no right, no right at all, to parade your ignorant assumptions--

</MARIANNE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are not assumptions. You told me.

ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks MARGARET again.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you nothing--

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll meet him when he comes, anyway.

</MARGARET>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is not the point. You do not speak of such things before strangers--

</MARIANNE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But everyone else was--

</MARGARET>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs Jennings is not everyone.

</MARIANNE>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like her! She talks about things. We never talk about things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush, please, now that is enough, Margaret. If you cannot think of anything appropriate to say, you will please restrict your remarks to the weather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
A heated pause.

	I like Colonel Brandon too. He's been to places.

EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, SIR JOHN, ELINOR and MRS. JENNINGS pack the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS. DASHWOOD and MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she saws impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The COLONEL's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KEEPER'S LODGE - BARTON PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIR JOHN and BRANDON are cleaning their guns in companionable silence--a habit left over from army days. SIR JOHN eyes BRANDON roguishly.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what they're saying, of course...

No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The word is that you have developed a taste for--certain company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
BRANDON stays resolutely silent. SIR JOHN is emboldened.

<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why not, say I. A man like you-- in his prime--she'd be a most fortunate young lady--

BRANDON cuts across him.

<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than she would of you, John.

	Brandon, my boy, do not think of yourself so meanly--

</SIR_JOHN>
<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all the better for her.

<DIRECTION>
SIR JOHN subsides. BRANDON is clearly as angry with himself as he is with SIR JOHN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARTON PARK - GARDENS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking to MRS. DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE, who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS. JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON.

	Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever I have been here, and I came fifteen years back. His estate at Delaford is but four miles hence and he and John are very thick. He has no wife or children of his own, for--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--he has a tragic history. He loved a girl once--twenty years ago now--a ward to his family, but they were not permitted to marry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>

ELINOR is intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On what grounds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money. Eliza was poor. When the father discovered their amour, she was flung out of the house and he packed off into the army. I believe he would have done himself a harm if not for John...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What became of the lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she was passed from man to man-- disappeared from all good society. When Brandon got back from India he searched for heaven knows how long, only to find her dying in a poor house. You have seen how it has affected him. Once I thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up, but she is much better off where she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at him now, though. So attentive. I shall try an experiment on him.

	Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, leave the poor Colonel alone.

MRS. JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though about to perform a magic trick.

(trillingly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Brandon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>

BRANDON looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have not heard you play for us of late!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the simple reason that you have a far superior musician here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you did not know, Miss Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares your passion for music and plays the piano forte very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play us a duet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
BRANDON looks at MRS. JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll trow you know quite as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come! Let us see you both side by side!

MARIANNE runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist. MARGARET stumbles after her, grumbling. We follow MARIANNE in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.

	Margaret, run home and fetch help.

The mists have thickened. They can no longer see where they are. Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders bravely and tries to sense the direction.

	I think it is this way. I will run as fast as I can, Marianne.

</MARGARET>

She dashes off. As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder of hooves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU Margaret's terrified expression. They seem to be coming from all around. She wheels and turns and then--Crash! Through the mist breaks a huge white horse. Astride sits an Adonis in hunting gear. MARGARET squeals. The horse rears. Its rider controls it and slides off. He rushes to MARIANNE's side.

	It is not broken. Now, can you put your arm about my neck?

It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it.

	Without a doubt, mine is 116.

	It is strange you should be reading them--for, look, I carry this with me always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLOUGHBY>
<DIRECTION>
It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted, and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though they were already intimates.

MRS. DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR, amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other.

WILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE supported by ELINOR and MRS. DASHWOOD.

He gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the road for a while.

<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good work, Marianne! You have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over.

</ELINOR>
<MARIANNE>

	I suppose I have erred against decorum. I should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads.

	No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

	No particular reason, Marianne, only that we know so little of him--

After dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON, MRS. DASHWOOD and MRS. JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a silhouette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLOUGHBY's profile glows behind the screen in front of her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty. The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven't you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full of laughter. They look at each other.

ELINOR and MRS. DASHWOOD are at the accounts. WILLOUGHBY and MARIANNE are on the other side of the room in the window seat, whispering together. Clearly, he is already part of the family.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_DASHWOOD>

	Surely you are not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?

<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Just not to eat beef.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. DASHWOOD is silenced but sighs crossly. ELINOR looks over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting off a lock of MARIANNE's hair, which he kisses and places in his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet. Hastily she rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARTON CHURCH. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY's curricle (the eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS. JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS stare after them and comment to each other.

MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together. MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently started indoors and is being continued here.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there was any true impropriety in my behaviour, I should be sensible of it, Elinor--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own discretion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs Jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every moment of our lives--

The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON on horseback.

<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Colonel, we shall be delighted.

At that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and MARIANNE's face lights up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I will of course be including Mr Willoughby in the party.

Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should be delighted to join you, Colonel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLOUGHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good morning, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Excellent. I understand you have a particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.

MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.

BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than satisfied with their behaviour.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister seems very happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_BRANDON>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions. In fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She is wholly unspoilt.

COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew a lady like your sister--the same impulsive sweetness of temper-- who was forced into, as you put it, a better acquaintance with the world. The result was only ruination and despair.

<DIRECTION>
People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE, MARGARET, MRS. JENNINGS and MRS. DASHWOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood, when Charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin Lucy! The last person I expected to see! 'Where did you pop out from, Miss?' says I. I was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS. JENNINGS continues sotto voce to MRS. DASHWOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She probably came on purpose to share the fun, for there are no funds for such luxuries at home, poor thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had not seen you for so long, dear Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses Dashwood she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that' for I don't know how long! And what do you think of them now you do see them, Lucy? My mother has talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr Palmer--are they not the very creatures she describes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<DIRECTION>
MR. PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PALMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PALMER>
<CHARLOTTE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing gaily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are quite rude today? He is to be an MP, you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him-- he says it is quite shocking--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<MRS_PALMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said anything so irrational. Don't palm all your abuses of the language upon me.
	</DIALOGUE>

(to Mrs Dashwood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always out of humour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
MR. PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege. WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves to him with a radiant smile. MRS. JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE and points to MARIANNE.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here he is! Now you shall see, Charlotte.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making her laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How now, Mr Willoughby! You must greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr Palmer--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<WILLOUGHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLOUGHBY>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<WILLOUGHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLOUGHBY>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely, leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS. JENNINGS coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know Mr Willoughby extremely well-- not that I ever spoke to him but I have seen him forever in town. Your sister is monstrous lucky to get him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is in love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs with MRS. JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I beg a seat beside you, Miss Dashwood? I have so longed to make your better acquaintance! I have heard nothing but the highest praise for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.
</DIRECTION>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would be delighted. But Sir John and Mrs Jennings are too excessive in their compliments. I am sure to disappoint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, for it was from quite another source that I heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face the new arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can this be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride. He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which BRANDON tears open. MRS. JENNINGS is puce with suppressed curiosity.

<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Impossible!

Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified. A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imperative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN is embarrassed and protests again.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Brandon, we are all assembled. We cannot picnic at Delaford without our host! Go up to town tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIR_JOHN>

	Or wait till we return and start then--you would not be six hours later.

<COLONEL_BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot afford to lose one minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.
</DIRECTION>

	Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! Just when I was to have the opportunity of speaking with you.

He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her shoulder.

There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLOUGHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he has threatened me with rain when I wanted it fine, he has found fault with the balance of my curricle and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. If it will be of any satisfaction to you, however, to be told I believe his character to be in all other respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for an acknowledgement that must give me some pain.

He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.

ELINOR glances at MRS. DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.

Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.

</WILLOUGHBY>

There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel shy.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I may stay behind from church.

EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who sway and reel into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows. The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for him. He strides inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping over a supine BEGGAR at the foot of the stairs, the HORSEMAN flings back his hood--it is BRANDON, hollow-eyed and dropping with weariness. We follow him up the stairs to a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns. BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his arms.

INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order to signal their presence. MARGARET giggles. Suddenly, MARIANNE bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the room opposite. ELINOR and MARGARET stand by the door in utter consternation, while MRS. DASH- WOOD goes to MARIANNE.

	Willoughby! What is the matter?

	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_DASHWOOD>
<WILLOUGHBY>

	For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait for an invitation from Barton Cottage?

	My engagements at present are of such a nature--that is--I dare not flatter myself--

<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLOUGHBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself further.

She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. There is a moment of stunned silence.

<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must have quarreled.

<MRS_DASHWOOD>

ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden in tears.

	Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature and if he had talked more of one young lady than any other... but he has never given a moment's alarm on that count.

INT. MRS. JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS. JENNINGS is all officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation. She whispers to MRS. JENNINGS, who laughs heartily.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be sure, my dear, you must just hand it to Pigeon there. He will take care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>

MARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her.

<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord above, you do not waste any time, Miss Marianne!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS. JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A letter! So they are definitely engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes here in town.

INT. MRS. JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE is pacing up and down in front of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ELINOR>

	John and Fanny are in town. I think we shall be forced to see them.

There is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps.

MARIANNE looks out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you are right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We hear a MAN's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed it is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL BRANDON.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Excuse me, Colonel--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice BRANDON's mood of tense distress.

ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion.

EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PALMERS, MRS. JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS. JENNINGS is gossiping with CHARLOTTE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is dear Edward, John? We expect to see him daily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither. MRS. JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.

FANNY smiles glacially.

MRS. JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.

<MRS_JENNINGS>

	Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?

She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR.

MRS. JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON.

MARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs. MRS. JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR.

<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I note you do not inquire for your messages, Miss Dashwood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, for I do not expect any, Mrs Jennings. I have very little acquaintance in town.

INT. MRS. JENNINGS'S HOUSE - MORNING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARIANNE, in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces restlessly, her letter in her hands. A slight knock at the door heralds a much-ruffled PIGEON, wig askew. MARIANNE hands him the letter. He bows and goes, highly disgruntled.
</DIRECTION>

MRS. JENNINGS is giving PIGEON his instructions for the day. MARIANNE comes running downstairs. PIGEON regards her drily.

<PIGEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No messages, ma am.

MARIANNE looks so dejected that MRS. JENNINGS takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not fret, my dear. I am told that this good weather is keeping many sportsmen in the country at present, but the frost will drive them back to town very soon, depend upon it.

MARIANNE brightens.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! I had not thought of-- thank you, Mrs Jennings!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs back upstairs. MRS. JENNINGS calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Miss Dashwood may set her heart at rest, for I overheard your sister- in-law say that she was to bring the elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAND CRESCENT LEADING TO BALLROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the GUESTS that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to walk to the entrance. We see MRS. JENNINGS, MARIANNE, ELINOR and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles. ELINOR nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto LUCY in order not to slip into the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND BALLROOM - EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great ballroom is crammed with GUESTS all determined to enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. MEN are sweating profusely, WOMEN dab their brows, rack punch is being swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch and all conversation is inordinately loud. Only the DANCERS have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing steps. MRS. JENNINGS and her brood bump into the PALMERS.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLOTTE>
<DIRECTION>
(screeching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is very merry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>

MRS. JENNINGS then spots FANNY, who is conducting a desultory conversation with an overpowdered ACQUAINTANCE. She drags ELINOR, MARIANNE and LUCY over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are! Goodness, how hot it is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone, I trust?

	Indeed not. John is just gone to fetch my brother--he has been eating ices.

LUCY clutches at ELINOR's sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother! I declare, that is good news indeed. At long last!

</MRS_JENNINGS>

And she beams her approval upon ELINOR.

<LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall faint clean away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
FANNY has seen JOHN threading his way towards them and waves at him. There is someone behind him. LUCY preens. JOHN bows to them.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother- in-law?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to reveal a good-looking young MAN with a vacuous smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear ladies--we meet at last!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
There is a general bowing and shaking of hands. ELINOR is relieved. LUCY drops a low curtsy.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you must be the younger brother? Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood here was counting on him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
ROBERT looks ELINOR up and down. He exchanges glances with FANNY before he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! He is far too busy for such gatherings--and has no special acquaintance here to make his attendance worthwhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in puzzlement.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I declare, I do not know what the young men are about these days-- are they all in hiding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR looks down, agonised with embarrassment.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of your brother, you must dance with our lovely Miss Dashwood!

</MRS_JENNINGS>
<ROBERT>

(not best pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be my honour.

<DIRECTION>
He turns to LUCY and bows.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And perhaps Miss Steele might consider reserving the allemande?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY curtsies again. ROBERT escorts a most unwilling ELINOR onto the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve, Miss Dashwood?

</ROBERT>

	I am excessively fond of a cottage. If I had any money to spare, I should build one myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Luckily for ELINOR the set changes and she is obliged to turn away from ROBERT. She wheels round to face her new partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced to take hands and resume the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLOUGHBY>
<DIRECTION>
(stiff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLOUGHBY>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<ELINOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<DIRECTION>
She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep her away from WILLOUGHBY.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are all extremely well, Mr Willoughby--thank you for your kind inquiry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELINOR>
<DIRECTION>
WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Willoughby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor shake hands with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely. Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at him proprietorially.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS. JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN, while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join the set.

	Thank you--I am most obliged. If you will excuse me, I must return to my party.

He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the SOPHISTICATED WOMAN.

<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Willoughby!

He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her.

They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS. JENNINGS turns back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing nearby.

	'My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you. My esteem for your family is very sincere but if I have given rise to a belief of more than I felt or meant to express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded.

<MRS_JENNINGS>

	Poor thing! She looks very bad. No wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but too true. I was told here in the street by Miss Morton, who is a great friend: he is to be married at the end of the month--to a Miss Grey with fifty thousand pounds. Well, said I, if 'tis true, then he is a good-for-nothing who has used my young friend abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul that his wife may plague his heart out!

ELINOR nods.

This is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens.

	I had failed Eliza in every other way--I could not refuse her now. I took the child--Beth is her name-- and placed her with a family where I could be sure she would be well looked after. I saw her whenever I could. I saw that she was headstrong like her mother--and, God forgive me, I indulged her, I allowed her too much freedom. Almost a year ago, she disappeared.

BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her and speaks with effort.

<COLONEL_BRANDON>

ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again. EDWARD is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. As LUCY is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only ELINOR.

	Miss Dashwood, how can I--

LUCY's eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.

	You must be surprised to find me here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought I was at your sister's house.

This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile but his facial muscles won't work. ELINOR decides to fetch help.

<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. The sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded, is that not so, Elinor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom she glances with a none too friendly air.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why have you taken so long to come and see us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been much engaged elsewhere.

</EDWARD>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Engaged elsewhere! But what was that when there were such friends to be met?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIANNE>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men never honour their engagements, little or great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, indeed--for Edward is the most fearful of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.

<MARIANNE>

Now EDWARD can stand it no longer.

<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me but I must take my leave--
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<MARIANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you are only just arrived!

ELINOR rises, desperate for them both to go.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must excuse me, I have a commission to attend to for Fanny--
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY jumps in like a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house, Mr Ferrars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
There is an extremely awkward pause.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him proprietorially.

After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.

	What do you know of my heart? What do you know of anything but your own suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I have had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature. It was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes. I have had to endure her exultation again and again while knowing myself to be divided from Edward forever. Believe me, Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you.

	Her family fluctuates at an alarming rate. Then, in London, when you told me of the Colonel's offer, I became convinced that you wanted me to marry Lucy and that--well, that you and Colonel Brandon...

	Me and Colonel Brandon!

<EDWARD>

	I shall not forget attempting to thank him for making it possible for me to marry the woman I did not love while convinced he had designs upon the woman I did--do--love.

EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can stand it no longer.

	Would you--can you--excuse me--

He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.

EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.

EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS, SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS. JENNINGS in a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR. PALMER, SIR JOHN, MRS. DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in regimental uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her seem much older.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN jump and dive for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into the surrounding countryside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around and moves off in the opposite direction.

THE END
