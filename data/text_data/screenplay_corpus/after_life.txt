INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLINDING WHITENESS We hear a MAN GASPING softly. Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WOMAN'S FACE Ethereal. Her eyes closed. Her face lifeless. Then... ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s). We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops. Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(SIGHS WEARILY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You used to enjoy it. Now it's...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head. Frustrated. Lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it's like fucking a corpse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far. Turns to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I'm sorry. That was--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom. Paul puts his head in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. But you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. Like you're somewhere else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't reply.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this about us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNA her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want us to be happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't move. We sense the emptiness inside her.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes. Forces herself to reply.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A DROP OF BLOOD falls into the water. Then another drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNA her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER carries into the next scene...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant. Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel. Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery. Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old trees onto statues of grieving angels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun streams into an elegant wood-panelled room. The Funeral Director, ELIOT DEANE (40s) guides MRS. AYRES (70s) past caskets tastefully arranged on faux-marble pedestals. He's a serene man. Quiet and professional.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(strokes the wood lovingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He gestures to a metal casket.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now about the service. Would you like a private visitation?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Ayres is miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Ayres?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<MRS_AYRES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Yes. A private visitation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(HESITATES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Deane? What happens when we die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_AYRES>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot chooses his words carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's different every time. Each person dies in their own way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space. The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out... ... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PARKING LOT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna locks her car. Heads towards the main building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy, walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Jack-off!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him. He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_KID>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you hear me Jack-off?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply.
</DIRECTION>
<ACNE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must be deaf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACNE_KID>
<TALL_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You deaf Jack-off?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack ignores them. Irritating the Tall Kid even more.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't fucking speak either.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator. Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just then the door opens. Anna walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing Miss Bryant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing? The incubator didn't just fall by itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Older Boys stare at Jack. Waiting for his reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tripped. It was an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks at Jack carefully. She knows he's lying.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Older Boys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show's over. Get to your classes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(TO JACK)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack. Help me clear up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna reaches in. Tenderly picks up the chick.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The poor thing's just scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
School's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large conference table covered with documents and thick files. He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Who took the last pepperoni?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Broccoli.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lifts out a slice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck ordered broccoli?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<NEAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh that's just disgusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEAL>
<PREPPY_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with vegetarian pizza? It's healthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREPPY_GUY>
<NEAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time. He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NEAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ordering in another pizza?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEAL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo loudly in the eerie quietness. Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns. WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step. The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly creeping up behind her. There's only one light still on as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her in a cold pool of light. Anna's unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the door. It doesn't open. She pushes hard with both hands. Nothing. It's locked. She turns back slowly. The darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She reaches out... ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness. Anna snatches her hand back. Stares at it. Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS. Moving deliberately towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(NERVOUSLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice echoes down the silent corridor. She glimpses something move in the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is someone there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent. Brooding. Anna can't move. Terrified. Suddenly the corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand. As she tentatively pulls her hand away... ...it's only Jack. His hand on the light switch.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I scare you Miss Bryant?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack moves over to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's locked.

He gently pushes against the door. The door slowly opens.

	Continually voted one of the top ten roller coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.

</ANNA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It will be fun.

They reach Anna's car. Stand in silence for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack. Those boys. Do they bother you a lot?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hesitates. Then slowly nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you can always talk to me about it if you want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. Anna's clearly worried about him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you don't need a ride?

Jack shakes his head. Anna glances at her watch.

</JACK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Jack. Funerals are very private affairs.

</ANNA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been to a funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNA>

	It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you?

<JACK>

<DIRECTION>
Jack nods disappointed. Anna watches him walk away then gets in her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANNA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon. Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window. Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HAIR SALON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna leans back against a washbasin. Her neck tightly cradled against the white porcelain. The light's harsh and not particularly flattering. She closes her eyes. Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER in latex gloves begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SINK Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink. Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room, we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with swift, violent precision. The bedside table's stacked with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room. Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a second. Then returns to her knitting.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrible color.

Anna moves to the beside table. Picks up a dirty plate.

</BEATRICE>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor said--

</ANNA>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do it? Today of all days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done wrong this time?

Anna goes to the window. Draws back the curtains.

<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've forgotten haven't you?

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I haven't forgotten. The service isn't till six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you've got plenty of time to wash it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's permanent. You can't wash it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then dye it back. You can't show up at the funeral looking like that. Like some prostitute.

<ANNA>

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna slips into the back of the room. Eliot leads MRS. HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON (70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a bouquet of white roses by the casket.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HUTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White roses. They were his favorite. How did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HUTTON>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They just seemed appropriate somehow.

</ELIOT>
<MRS_HUTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks so peaceful. As if he's only sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton. She doesn't notice Eliot watching her carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Hutton. I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MRS_HUTTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Anna. You were always his favorite student.

Anna smiles awkwardly. Uncomfortable.

<ANNA>

</MRS_HUTTON>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>

But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine. Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER. Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.

James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming. Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.

	VIEWING ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face serene again. It must have been her imagination. She glances up quickly. Embarrassed. Eliot's still observing her. He nods to her cordially.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall. Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge of ANOTHER POLAROID. Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment, then takes off his jacket and moves to the window.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S POV

<DIRECTION>
Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys. Getting increasingly frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag. She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary. She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.
</DIRECTION>

Eliot watches intently as Anna drives away.

<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside. He glances at his watch then nervously checks his pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a moment then slips it back into his pocket. As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment through the window marbled with rain. Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window. He starts. Spills some of his red wine on his shirt. CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower. Spreading out over the white material.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You scared the life out of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna laughs as she sits down. Paul looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that. It's just very... red. I mean it's not really you is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready to order?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We'll have the duck.

</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul.

</ANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You always have the duck here.

</PAUL>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up the menu)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't always have the duck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have the duck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The duck is very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not argue tonight. OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna takes a sip of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the bottle. Checks the label.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And looks very expensive...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILES QUESTIONINGLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the special occasion?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's momentarily thrown. He tries to cover it by rearranging his napkin. Anna notices.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly very serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually there is something I need to talk to you about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Anna's nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been offered a transfer to head office in Chicago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks down. Stares at her hands on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll mean more work of course. More responsibility. A lot of changes. But it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be crazy to turn it down. And...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(NERVOUS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well I've been thinking. Maybe it's time for us to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to leave me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's stunned. Speechless. Before he can say anything--
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could've just told me this morning. You didn't need to buy me off with an expensive meal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul reaches for her hand. Anna gets up to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you lie to me? You promised everything was going to be OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be ridiculous. Anna. You've got it all wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not being ridiculous. Why do you always talk to me like I'm a small child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(as if talking to a small child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna.

</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? There you go again. Do you know how irritating that is?

</ANNA>
<PAUL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Can't we just have one fucking meal without arguing--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The other DINERS turn and stare at them. Paul glances at them embarrassed. Anna doesn't notice. Upset.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your voice down, everyone's watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK YOU!

</ANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy. You know that? Just like your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm nothing like my mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna grabs her coat. Pushes her way through the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(STANDS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not running after you this time Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

<DIRECTION>
Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. He quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna closes the car door. It's still raining hard outside. Her hair, perfect minutes ago, is now bedraggled. Her make- up's running. She places her hands on the steering wheel. Trying desperately to pull herself together. Suddenly. THUMP. Anna jumps. Turns. Paul's at the car window. He thumps the glass again. Anna hits the locks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Paul grabs the door handle.

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>

Anna can't hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive.
</DIRECTION>

Paul stumbles aside as Anna's car pulls away. She stops at the parking lot exit a short distance away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

She hesitates. For a moment we think she might go back to him...
</DIRECTION>

... but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway. Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she dials a number. She looks up... a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna swerves into the next lane. We hear the blaring horn from the car behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. OK. I saw you.

The cell phone connects. We hear Paul's answering machine.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don't want it to end like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat. Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass. A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON METAL PIPES The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. A bright light comes on. CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands. Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel. In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet. We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock. The room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light. Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket. Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual. Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing... ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe. Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist. Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe. Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off. He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when... Anna OPENS HER EYES. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. Strangely Eliot's not surprised. He calmly steps back. Watches her carefully. Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot. She's groggy. Confused.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She talks with difficulty. Her breathe labored.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in a funeral home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit up but she can't even raise her head. Her body stiff. Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document. Holds it up for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DOCUMENT It's Anna's death certificate.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your death certificate. Cause of death. Massive internal trauma. Time of death. 8.23PM.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so distressed.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley. Wets it.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot delicately washes Anna's face. She doesn't flinch as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me! Why are you touching me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm preparing your body. You have to look beautiful for your funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You all say the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Maybe you should rest now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door. As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and looks at Anna for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNA The lights go off. O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks automatically behind Eliot.
</DIRECTION>

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul wakes up. Badly hung-over. Still in his clothes. Sunlight streams into the room. Blinding him. He reaches across. The bed's empty. He's surprised for a moment then remembers the argument the night before. He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. Leans down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the RING BOX falls onto the floor. Paul doesn't notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - LATER

Paul steps into the kitchen. Nervously checking his BlackBerry. Nothing. Just then he sees the red light blinking on his answer machine. He presses play.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don't want it to end like this.

Paul's relieved. He picks up the phone. Dials. We hear the ringing on the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two technicians, an OLD GUY and his YOUNG PALE ASSISTANT, push a NAKED BODY wrapped in plastic through the morgue. They jump as they hear the MUFFLED sound of a cell phone. The ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on a table (we recognize it as Anna's bag). The Assistant walks over. Takes out the cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the schoolteacher's. From the car crash. Should I answer it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The ringing stops abruptly. It's suddenly very silent.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's in for a surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<OLD_GUY>

As the Assistant reaches for the bag, he notices a solitary shoe on the table. He picks it up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What shall I do with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the other one?

<DIRECTION>
The Assistant looks round. He can't see the other shoe anywhere. He turns to the Old Guy and shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just burn it. You can't send them back one shoe. It's not respectful.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Paul pulls up to a suburban house. Walks quickly to the door, a supermarket bouquet of flowers wrapped in cellophane in his hand. He rings the bell. No-one answers. He rings again. Knocks hard on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna!

Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the driveway's empty. He heads back to his car.

</PAUL>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hasn't called in at all. It's not like her. She always calls in.

Paul's worried now. Something's wrong.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed. Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns. Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty. Nervously looks around. For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation as he approaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I hurt you? You're already dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't know what to say. She turns her head away. A tear falls down her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Just let me go. I won't go to the police. I won't tell anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot moves her head back. Gently wipes away her tear.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still in denial. You have to trust me. I'm only here to help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments. Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna. The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job. Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid. Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(TO HIMSELF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother's early.

<DIRECTION>
Anna's eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close. Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Nurse, DIANE (30s) follows Beatrice in her wheelchair as Eliot leads them through the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>

	I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's always so tragic when you lose a child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lost her years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>

He glances at her curiously. Then gestures to his office.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd care to come to my office we can discuss the arrangements.

</ELIOT>
<BEATRICE>

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beatrice leans against the slab staring at Anna's covered body. Eliot stands respectfully to one side. In the b.g. Diane shivers. The room's cold. Beatrice touches Anna's hand through the white sheet. Then uncovers Anna's face. The needle's still embedded in her eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle. Cuts the thread with a pair of large scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I said. I've only just started preparing her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the point of preserving the body if the soul's already left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The soul never leaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beatrice stares at Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's us who are left behind. It's us who suffer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(TO ANNA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's going to look after me now? Did you think about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods to Diane. Diane helps her into the wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll confirm the date with Father Graham this afternoon. Friday as you requested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just do what you think's best. It's just details.

Beatrice whirs towards the door. She suddenly stops. Turns to Eliot.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh there is one thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Beatrice doesn't acknowledge him. Paul turns to Diane.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Diane. I need to talk to Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Diane can't look him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>

</PAUL>
<BEATRICE>

(WITHOUT TURNING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna was in a car accident last night. My daughter's dead. That's what happened.

Paul stares at Beatrice's back in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A car crash? When?

Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul.

</DIANE>
<PAUL>

	But... we were at the restaurant...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beatrice glares at him. She clearly blames him for Anna's death.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't have let her drive in that weather.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She can't be dead. There must be some mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no mistake. We just got back from the funeral home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair. As she whirs past Paul she notices the flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
<DIRECTION>
(DRYLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flowers? How appropriate.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you call me?

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. O.S. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. Anna opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep. She stares at us. Numb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON an exploding BLUE FLAME from a gas ring. We pull back. Eliot places a kettle on the ring. Then measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin into a teapot. Meticulous in everything he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Anna's hand. Her fingers FLEX slightly. She pushes herself up awkwardly. Suddenly realizes something. She touches her wrist. Desperately searching for her pulse. Then frantically checks her neck. Panicking. She can't find her heartbeat. She stares at her hand. Then abruptly SLAMS it against the slab. Hard. She feels no pain. She does it again. Harder. Still nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must be in shock. That's all. It's just shock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door. Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me out!

</ANNA>

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot's by his desk. Checking his appointment book. Whistling softly to himself. We can't hear Anna's cries. He pours a cup of tea. Adds a drop of milk. As he stirs his tea, he hears the sound of feet CRUNCHING on the gravel outside. He glances out the window.

Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the Funeral Home.

Eliot steps out of the Funeral Home. Heads towards Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?

Paul turns to him. Pulled away from his thoughts.

</PAUL>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	Of course. The lawyer.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a small town. In my line of work you get to know everyone eventually.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely. As if he senses something.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Anna Bryant's fiancée.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's strange. She wasn't wearing an engagement ring.

Paul quickly controls his anger. His eyes smart with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to stop her. She didn't hear me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's voice breaks with emotion. He can't go on. Eliot gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Conran. There really is nothing I can do. I'm so sorry.

Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head. Eliot watches him get into his car and drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna sits by the door in the darkness. Suddenly the room's flooded with light. Eliot walks in. Looks at Anna for a moment. She just stares back at him coldly. He heads over to the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

Eliot smiles. Amused she caught him out. He continues washing his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you love him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks up sharply. Eliot's clearly hit a nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's none of your business.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot shrugs. Dries his hands on a white towel.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't going to tell me Paul was here, were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it would only hurt you. You have to let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you.

</ELIOT>
<ANNA>

	I don't believe you. Why are you doing this to me?

He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>

	You're all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault.

	No. You drugged me. So my mother

He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it. Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>

Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment. Then switches off the main lights.

He ignores her. The door CLICKS shut behind him.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks empty. Dispirited. Just then something catches her attention... The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness. Grabs the scissors. Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet, lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away. Scared. But then, almost against her will, she approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She slowly pulls the sheet away... The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken, Anna pushes herself against the wall.

<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen wrecked cars. Twisted metal. Paul's footsteps echo through the empty garage. It's dark. Out the corner of his eye Paul glimpses a SHAPE move quickly around a pillar. He stops. Unsettled. Just then we hear a WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS. Her high-heels clicking on the concrete floor. There's something strange about the sound. UNNATURAL. Paul listens nervously. The footsteps grow fainter. Then fade away. The garage is silent again. Too quiet. Paul moves apprehensively over to Anna's GREEN TOYOTA. The car's a mess. One side's completely caved in. He touches the car. Pulls open the door. Squeezes into the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ANNA'S CAR
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange noise. He looks up... The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us. Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns. ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him. The color drains from Paul's face.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Eliot stops by a thermostat. Studies it for a moment. Turns it lower. He glances at his watch. Takes out his keys from his jacket and moves over to the Prep Room door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna sits on the slab. Her hands behind her back. She carefully watches Eliot as he pulls on his pale blue smock then walks over to a cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND ANNA'S BACK her hands clutch the large scissors.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Whitehall.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't be afraid of her. The dead can't harm the dead.

</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(FORCEFULLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP... she slashes at Eliot's face with the SCISSORS. The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley. Instruments crash to the floor. Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ELIOT>

<ANNA>

</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(CALMLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye. He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

For a moment we think she might do it. But then she wavers.

<ELIOT>

	What are you waiting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand. The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm breathing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raises her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. I'm still alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. It's normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels. Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors made a mistake. They're always making mistakes.

</ANNA>

Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what happens when you die?

</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends on how you lived your life.

</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don't let go until long after they're in the grave.

	Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here?

</ANNA>

<DIRECTION>
Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come. We've wasted enough time already.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired. Eliot leans over her to apply what's left of the dye.

<ANNA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please. I don't want--

</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can breathe. I must be alive.

<DIRECTION>
She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's face, but just as quickly he controls it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people. You all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you're alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't know what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna turns her head away. Clearly he's struck a chord.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it? Maybe you died a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot rips off his latex gloves. Tosses them into a bin.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to tell you I'm surprised you're still arguing with me. You don't have much time left.

<DIRECTION>
(gestures to the Old Women)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. She's accepted her death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now she's at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have nothing to learn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?

<DIRECTION>
Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light. His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your funeral's in three days. Soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you then. No-one will talk to you there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move. Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you cold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the Old Woman's hand. Strokes her paper-thin skin.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light. The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.
</DIRECTION>

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul stands motionless in the middle of the room. Staring blankly into space. The room feels empty and depressing. He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player. Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PAUL The music's strangely distorted now. Almost silent. As if we were inside Paul's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. O.S. we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head. The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush. Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley. The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised. The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow to normal size. Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel trolley now towers high above her. The massive instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a solid wall of DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep Room behind her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then... ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.

A small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs. "AVE MARIA" plays quietly in the b.g. A MAN leans over the casket paying his respects.

ON CASKET The Old Woman. Her long hair braided. She looks serene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"AVE MARIA" filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes. She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone. Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside. Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm across the counter top in rage. Sending everything crashing to the floor.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

The funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of flowers from a vase.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind him. He turns. Jack's at the top of the stairs. Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door. Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>

Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room. Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro. Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments. Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.

Anna stares at him blankly.

For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together. Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes. Hugs her legs closer to her chest.

The tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves. A sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage. Their leaves ripple. Languid and fluid like a wave. RUSTLING EERILY. The sound almost malevolent.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's red-rimmed eyes snap open. He lies on his bed fully clothed. An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside table. Behind him the curtains stir. The KITSCHY DOLL'S head begins to slowly nod. Turning towards us. We hear the eerie rustling sound again. Like a MURMURING WHISPER...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

(O.S.) (WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It's only the wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again. This time from the bathroom. Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates. The room's strangely silent. He slowly opens the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps. Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head slightly. A feeling. He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence. Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING. Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PAUL'S POV
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound... ...as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe.

Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be. The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist. She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's not even running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENING

Jack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell. From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV.

There's no reply. Jack grabs his jacket.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't my dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizes with shock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my mother's dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then takes something out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ELIOT'S HAND An old-fashioned wooden rosary.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should have been her not me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Eliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was the one dying. Not me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop. Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not ready to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you still struggling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(PLAINTIVELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not ready to die. Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the open door again. Eliot follows her look.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing out there for you anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ELIOT as he gets up and turns to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room. Nudges the door stop away with his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The door locks behind him with a CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of Anna just before the accident).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He's low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and makes a left turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna staggers to the door. There's at least a dozen keys. She frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(begging the door to open)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't fit. She's panicking. She fumbles for another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot replaces the pump nozzle. Walks over to the cashier.
</DIRECTION>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-four fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out of the gas station. Eliot doesn't notice him as he pulls out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he frowns. Something's wrong. He checks his pockets again. He can't find his keys. He walks quickly away.
</DIRECTION>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir. Your change.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued, Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

<DIRECTION>
Anna's still trying to pry out the broken key.

Eliot's at a red light. Drumming his fingers in frustration as he waits for the light to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Anna pulls out the broken key. Quickly chooses another. Turns it gently. Again it doesn't fit. Anna's hysterical now. She tries the next key. It fits! She's stunned for a second. Then pulls open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna staggers to the front door. She pulls at the door. It won't open. Frantically she finds the key. Unlocks the door, leaving the keys in the lock. As she opens the door, HEADLIGHTS sweep across the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Eliot's van pulls up in front of the house.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Anna's trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot's footsteps on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot reaches the front door. It's slightly ajar. He pushes it open. Steps warily inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks around. The entrance hall's empty. Then he notices the keys in the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark. Anna pulls at the back door. It won't budge. She panics. Sees a kitchen knife on the counter. Quickly grabs it. As she steps back, she knocks over a metal bucket. The sound's DEAFENING in the silent house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot hears the NOISE. Smiles. He calmly locks the door and puts the keys into his pocket. Moves down the hallway towards the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot switches on the light. The kitchen's empty. He steps back into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands very still. Watching. Waiting. We pull back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUST AROUND THE CORNER Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HALLWAY

<DIRECTION>
Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction towards the viewing room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet STAMPING along the hallway behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna runs to the front door. It's locked. She glances around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs. She weakly stumbles up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room. Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs. He cocks his head upwards. Straining to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone.

A telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen.

Anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the RINGING on the other end.

Eliot slowly climbs the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>

The phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna glances back to the door in panic.

Finally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's HOARSE DISTORTED VOICE sounds almost malevolent. Paul's stunned. He stares at the phone as if it was possessed. Then slowly puts it down.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna looks at the phone in disbelief. The MONOTONOUS TONE DRONES in the ear piece. She doesn't notice Eliot appear in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the light comes on.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the only one who can hear you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window. Eliot walks over and calmly replaces the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be very careful if I were you. The dead have such a hold over the living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>

	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He still feels your presence. You're only causing him more pain. If you really loved him, you'd accept your death and let him go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then prove to me I'm really dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people. You always need proof.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot places his hands on her shoulders. Turns her towards a tall mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MIRROR A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes. A blood-stained tear in the side of her RED SLIP.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	UPSTAIRS ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's stunned. She moves closer to the mirror. Touches her reflection through a thin layer of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I look like a corpse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you are a corpse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
ON MIRROR Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>

Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of his child's first step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S POV

Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle. Looking up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.

Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at the window. Calmly. Curiously.

Eliot coolly turns back to Anna. She hasn't noticed Jack. Still staring at her reflection in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>

Paul stares at the telephone. After a moment he slowly pulls the telephone plug out of the wall. Mechanically grabs a plastic bin liner from underneath the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Paul opens the wardrobe. Pulls out Anna's clothes. Stuffs them into the bin liner. He notices the Kitschy Doll. Shoves it in with Anna's clothes.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lies on the slab. She stares at us blankly. Her face emotionless. Resigned. Eliot rinses her hair now dyed back to brown. She slowly closes her eyes. CLOSE ON RED DYE draining into the sink. Eliot picks up the scissors. Carefully slices open Anna's red slip. Delicately peels the slip off her body. Anna doesn't react. CLOSE ON Anna. She opens her eyes. Confused. She turns her head... she's in PAUL'S BEDROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The light comes back on. Paul stands by the light switch.

Anna's getting nervous. Something's not right.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What neighbors? You don't have any neighbors.

Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>

CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks away guiltily.

Eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. He looks at a day calendar on his desk. Idly flips over the page from Tuesday to Wednesday.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's no problem at all.

He glances at his watch.

GRAY BODIES lie on steel tables. Eliot moves over to one of the CORPSES. Examines it with professional interest. Just then the Old Guy walks in with the Pale Assistant pushing a gurney with a BODY wrapped in plastic sheeting.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well here he is. Frank Merano.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away.
</DIRECTION>

ON BODY FRANK (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened. His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face.

The Principal and Janitor walk away. Paul reaches inside the locker. Pulls out a stack of exercise books. An empty pills bottle. Then he notices something in the back of the locker. He pulls it out. It's a PHOTOGRAPH of Paul and Anna together on vacation. Smiling. Happy. Paul looks at it for a moment. Trying hard to hold back his emotions.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors. The ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts hypnotically across the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just... I'm having these...

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her slab watching Eliot work.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ANNA'S POV
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him. He leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His mouth. To keep it closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now his eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this how you'll prepare my body?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks at her for a moment. Smiles reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he have family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. A brother. He's coming in later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not important anymore.

</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(HESITATES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He didn't cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew he wouldn't. He always got upset when I cried. He said crying never helped.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily against the slab. As if she's about to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He guides her back to the slab. Helps her lie down.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're getting weaker. It's almost time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot strokes her hair tenderly. She looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do we die?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To make life important.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More ominous. Claustrophobic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON POLAROID The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found what you were looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply. As if someone had spoken to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman. No need to apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot moves over to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really enjoyed our time together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins. Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in the Young Man's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anthony. Anthony. Always confused.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs. Eliot moves to the window.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S POV
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door. A SQUAD CAR parked on the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot steps back. Calmly continues to dry his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - DAY

Eliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I help you Officer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to see the body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stops. We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank Merano. I'm his brother. Vincent Merano? I called this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Merano. Yes. Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(OFFICER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope it's no trouble. I'd just like to see him before the funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot glances at his watch. Smiles at Vincent.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no trouble at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks so peaceful. You've done a beautiful job. Thank-you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should remember him as he used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side. Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the schoolteacher isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(QUICKLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything else I can help you with?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent frowns. Turns back to Eliot.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's not right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent nods towards Frank's body.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His smile. It was a bit more...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find the right word.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...smiley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smiley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
ON FRANK'S MOUTH Eliot manipulates Frank's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A touch more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's much better. Thank-you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad I could help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes alone with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot hesitates. Then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not at all. I'll wait outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body. As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I didn't see...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll see you at the service. Thanks again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just told you. That was your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Frank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had an accident. You're dead. Why do you people never listen to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank doesn't move. His mouth still wired shut.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's not a gift. It's a curse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take care of each of you as if you were my children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot's extremely irritated now. He grabs a garish red lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slams down the lipstick.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
ON FRANK'S FACE The crudely drawn bright red lips. Clown-like circles of rouge. Gaudy and macabre.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't talk because you have nothing to say. And you have nothing to say because you're a corpse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to talk again.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Now I don't want to talk to you anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless, in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm off to school now.

<DIRECTION>
His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway.

Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush. Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously through the empty room to an open casket. He glances back, then leans over the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JACK'S POV

<DIRECTION>
Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior. His face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.

Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand. In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room. He stops surprised. Watches Jack intently.

<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have empathy with the dead. You're drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to you. It's a rare gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack can't look Eliot in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you saw Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hesitates. Then nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're frightened by it. I was scared too the first time. But you shouldn't be. Christ had the same gift. He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead.

<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't be afraid.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. Eliot places a bunch of tulips on the trolley. Turns on a CD. CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the room as before. He moves over to Anna. Gently Pulls away the sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your fingernails are dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot smiles. Examines his nails.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your hands are normally so clean.

</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been gardening.

He walks over to the sink. Scrubs his nails.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it sunny outside?
	</DIALOGUE>

Eliot fills a bowl with water. Carries it to the slab.

	Yes. The tulips love the sun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss the sun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they your favorite flower?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tulips? Yes. I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit. Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies. Don't they symbolize death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They symbolize purity.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And tulips?

Eliot hesitates for a second before replying.

Eliot puts down the sponge. Dries her body with a towel.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Roses are red, violets are blue...

He reaches over to the CD player to switch it off.

Eliot smiles. Leaves the music on.

</PAUL>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I know him. He's often round here. He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He's eleven years old Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if you'll excuse me--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think he imagined it. I think he really saw her.

Paul runs over to the Prep Room door. He grabs the handle. It's locked. Eliot appears behind him. Paul turns.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in here isn't she? Give me the key.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stares at Paul with pity.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the fucking key.

Paul turns back. POUNDS the door in rage.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

<DIRECTION>
The POUNDING echoes through the room. Anna awkwardly sits up. Struggling with her emotions. She wants to call out but knows she has to let Paul go.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna!
	</DIALOGUE>

Anna gets up. Hesitates. Weakly stumbles to the door.

He places the palm of his hand against the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

<DIRECTION>
Anna places her palm against the door. As if touching Paul's hand. A tear falls down her cheek.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be happy again. I promise.

<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Conran. She's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul pushes him away.

</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lies down on the slab. Closes her eyes. ELIOT'S VOICE seems far away now. Receding.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but you've got to accept she's gone.

<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An open plan office. Paul weaves quickly through the rows of desks. He seems unbalanced. Manic. DETECTIVES cautiously watch Paul approach Tom sitting at his desk, his head bent over paperwork.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to issue a search warrant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks up. He's shocked by Paul's appearance.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(LOUDLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a fucking search warrant. Now are you going to help me or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
JEFF (20s) a Young Detective at a nearby desk stands. Tom nods to him. It's under control.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul hesitates for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(FIRMLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit. Down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul sits. Tom leans forward. He's not amused.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what the hell do you think you're doing? I got a call from Eliot Deane. Are you out of your fucking mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see her. He's keeping her there--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna was in a car accident. Her car was wrecked Paul. Remember? It's downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet. Takes out a file. Hands it to Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the Coroner's report.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul manically rifles through the file.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shows file to Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The paramedics phoned it in. They only checked for eye dilation and pulse. The doctor signed the death certificate without even seeing her body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(IRRITATED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? That's standard procedure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was no EEG. Nothing. He could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drugged her? Are you serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are drugs like that chief. Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis within seconds. The heartbeat slows to almost nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom shoots Jeff a look.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? I'm telling you. She's not dead. The boy at school. Jack. He saw her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him. Vincent Merano stands by Jeff's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was on the slab. Dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen dead bodies. Believe me, she was definitely dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom. Just go down there and check the place out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On what grounds Paul? Do you have any evidence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul hesitates. We sense his uncertainty.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she called me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Called you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(WEAKLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the telephone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Collect or long distance?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff snorts with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First you hit a fucking kid. Then you attack Deane. And now you're telling me your dead girlfriend called you? What the fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if he were crazy. Tom's voice softens.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you feel guilty but you've got to pull yourself together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul slumps in the chair. Rubs his face.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you're right. But why won't he let me see her?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his desk. Jeff turns back to his work.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow. You'll see her then. It'll help. It will give you closure. Trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure. For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you could teach me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave. Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only a hole in the ground. I'm digging it for--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Bryant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. For Anna. She belongs here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Because there's no life left in her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack carefully considers Eliot's words.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm the only one who can see all these corpses. Wandering the earth aimlessly. All they do is piss and shit. Suffocating us with their stench. Doing nothing with their lives. Taking the air away from those who actually want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now there's two of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a moment then reaches for the shovel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna watches Eliot brush an invisible speck off her mother's black dress.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did well this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She talks with difficulty now. Her voice SLURRED and HOARSE. Her words muddled and rambling. Her eyes even more sunken. Her skin even more pale.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Paul came. You did the right thing. You let him go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll be all right now? Won't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot looks away. Doesn't reply. He drapes the dress over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and moves over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONFUSED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I have to get dressed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow's your funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot lifts Anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves of the dress. Her body's stiff and unyielding.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. You only had three days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He delicately turns her onto her side. Buttons up the dress.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to use your time well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna frowns. As if trying to remember something. Eliot gently lifts her legs. Pulls on a pair of black tights.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to... I have so many regrets. I have nothing but regrets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at him. Suddenly realizing.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I'm here isn't it? To be judged.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot picks up Anna's shoes. Slips them onto her stiff feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're here to understand your life. So you can finally be at peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted a different life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot picks up a nail-clipper. Gently holds Anna's hand as he carefully cuts her long nails.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why didn't you do anything about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter what I did everything just stayed the same. I'd wake up. I'd shower. Sit in the same traffic everyday on my way to work. Go home. Go to sleep. Then wake again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stops clipping her nails. Irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you really want from life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to be happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(DERISIVELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy. What does it mean Anna? To be happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Don't you understand? That's the whole point. I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you do! You're just too scared to admit it to yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna turns away ashamed. She knows he's right.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk about it anymore. I just want this to be over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you want from life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't fucking know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT DID YOU WANT ANNA?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(SCREAMS BACK)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I WANTED LOVE! OK!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's stunned. She's finally admitted it.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(QUIETLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had love. Paul loved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You don't understand. I was scared. I wanted to love but I didn't know how. I was...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a child... my mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a child. I learnt that love. That when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way no one could ever hurt me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at the slab. Touches the cold marble.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was always pushing Paul away. He thought I didn't love him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stares at her intently. Comes to a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do if you had another chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it. Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold light. Anna doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well? Isn't this what you wanted?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot holds out his hand. Anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna approaches her mother's house. Paul opens the door. He's not surprised to see her. Beatrice stands just behind him. A black shawl over her head and arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like an ANCIENT PRAYER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily. The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER. Through the chaos of words we begin to make out...
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spit it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spit it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna spits out... white maggots. She gags again. Closes her eyes. Shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room. She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were different. You all say you're scared of death. But the truth is you're more scared of life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot switches off the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home. It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house. He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge. Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE BUSHES Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUNERAL HOME
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly. A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Figure lowers the flashlight. It's Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm taking you home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON black earth. A trowel digs into the soil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back. Jack's just finished digging a hole in the flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid. The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be scared. It's better this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot lies on his bed. Dressed in a dark suit. He hasn't slept at all. His eyes rimmed red. He checks the clock on the bedside table. It's 4.30am. He glances to the window. Dawn light seeps into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the delicate flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress. Her eyes closed. Eliot enters the room. He doesn't lock the door behind him. Doesn't turn the lights on. Doesn't change into his mortician smock. He approaches the slab. The violets in his hand. Pulls over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets on the steel trolley beside her. He looks at her intently. For the first time he seems uncertain. Vulnerable. As if questioning himself. After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the door. He's about to close the door behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know your name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNA Her eyes still closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ELIOT Eliot pauses. Too confused to look back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not important.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEATRICE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Beatrice's face. Her eyes closed. A HAND delicately powders her forehead. As if she's being prepared for her own funeral. We pull back. Beatrice, dressed in black, sits in front of a mirror. Diane applies her make-up. Beatrice opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, badly shaven, leans against the washbasin. Wearing a crumpled black suit. Staring vacantly in the mirror.

She looks up smiling. Eliot positions her hands, entwining her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to look beautiful for your funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID. Fills the syringe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON AMPOULE We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>

Eliot smiles. Picks up a mirror. Hands it to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MIRROR Anna looks peaceful. Beautiful. Serene.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the end?

</ANNA>

	The last part is the most difficult. You'll have to face it alone. But you'll be at peace soon.

Anna nods. SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror. She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PREP ROOM

	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna. We've been through this before. You're just imagining--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lied to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still clutching onto life. Don't give in to your fears. You're so close.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's fading away. Her hand drops limply to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you lie to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops struggling. Stares blankly at us. Eliot looks at her for a moment. Sadly. Regretfully. He picks up a Polaroid camera. The flash explodes in a blinding white light. He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels off the front and fans it in the air. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNA ...delicately closes Anna's eyelids.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good bye Anna.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's funeral is in progress. Eliot stands by her casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies. Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack and other CHILDREN.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Paul appear at the door. Tom guides Paul to a seat near the back.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_GRAHAM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy; and the earth will bring those long dead to birth again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
ON CASKET Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed. She can hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have come here today to remember before God our sister Anna. To give thanks for her life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANNA'S FACE We see an almost imperceptible frown.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	VIEWING ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket. Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the violets in Anna's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Violets. They were her favorite flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Eliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIANE>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Next we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PAUL'S POV
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks serene.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	VIEWING ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger. Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's so cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns back to Anna. Tears prick his eyes. He touches her cheek again. Finally accepting her death.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look then turns and stares at Paul. As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket. Begins to screw down the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING. Anna's eyes FLICKER OPEN then close again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Paul turns back sharply. As if he sensed Anna's reaction inside the casket. Tom gently stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's at peace now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows Tom to lead him away. Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room. Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON COFFIN A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	VIEWING ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(SOFTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be scared. It's better this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot turns. Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out. But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin. Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have but a short time to live. Like a flower we blossom and then wither. In the midst of life we are in death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackness. Earth CLATTERS HEAVILY onto the wooden lid. Anna GASPS softly. Hyperventilating. The earth keeps falling. The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful. She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles flicker on top. In the b.g. MOURNERS head to their cars. Paul and Tom stand by the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you're going to be OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Thanks Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot carefully pins Anna's Polaroid to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON POLAROIDS We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before. But now we look at them differently. In some faces there is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading look. In others passive resignation.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot moves towards the window.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S POV
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles illuminate Anna's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine Anna. The whole world, your mother, your fiancée, your friends. Everyone has buried you. They've placed a stone above your body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELIOT'S ROOM
	</DIALOGUE>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've said their good byes and gone back to their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going to happen to them. Until it's their turn to be buried. Think about it Anna...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot glances at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...think about it while you still can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul unlocks his car. He's about to open the car door when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack's observing him carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said she was alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said she was alive. I just said I saw her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul simply nods his head. Too drained of emotion to react.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul opens the car door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Conran?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(PAUL TURNS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul nods. Gets in his car. Jack looks up at the Funeral Home.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JACK'S POV
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're at Anna's wake. PEOPLE talk quietly in small groups. Paul fills a glass with whiskey. Knocks it back in one. PEOPLE stare disapprovingly. WHISPERING to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think you've had enough to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him. Paul pours himself another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
An ELDERLY COUPLE shake their heads and walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
<DIRECTION>
(AMUSED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Conran. We're at a wake. You should show more respect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know she wasn't dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home, making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(TAUNTING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think Anna was alive after the accident? Maybe you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she's still alive. You obviously don't believe a word I say. So why don't you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran. Find out whether she's alive or dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels. Shoves him against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(LOUDLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You twisted fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul. Eliot whispers in Paul's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have much time left.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Paul. You're not well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly. Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul sprints across the lawn to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul slips his key into the ignition. His hand's shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can't see a thing. But we can hear Anna's SHORT SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately SCRATCHING at the coffin lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner. A bright white light sweeps through his car. Paul's momentarily blinded.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_SCREEN_FLASHES_TO_WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago. Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON REARVIEW MIRROR An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him. Blasts past.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CAR
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks through the front windshield. Nothing. He frowns. Where did the ambulance go?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	UP AHEAD
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Funeral Home. Bone white in the moonlight. The cemetery next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot's White Van sits by the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid. Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN. Her fingernails torn and bloody. Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave. Her body slumps limply like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna. I'm here. Please God. Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life left in her. He's about to give up when... Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS. Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby. Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul gently helps Anna to her feet. She looks round. Dazed. Turns back to Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came back for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came back for you. You're safe now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's something unnerving about the silence. Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts. Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees. Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past. Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul frantically runs into the parking lot. Still calling out for Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on. Paul looks at the car nervously. He heads over to it. Apprehensive. Then... the car door slowly CLICKS open. Paul stops. Stares into the car. There's no one there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the windshield we see Paul approach the car. He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly around him revealing... ... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we going home?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns sharply. Stunned. Anna moves towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or do you want to make love here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on. We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting for you. I missed you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls like a flower. Spreading out over the material.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you. I always did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately. Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(ALARMED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only the scissors...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes. Anna's just interested in his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scissors? What scissors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scissors. For your clothes. Eliot just put them on the table.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul pulls back. Terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're safe now. We're finally together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS. Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light. Slowly the room comes into focus...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot stands over Paul holding a pair of BLOODY SCISSORS. Paul looks down. His white shirt soaked with blood, the material sliced open.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He talks with difficulty. His breath labored.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in a funeral home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dead.

</ELIOT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack appears at Eliot's side.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a car accident. You swerved off the road. On the way to the cemetery. Hit a tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw Anna. You buried her alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it to the cemetery. You never saw Anna. You're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's glazed eyes widen in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot speaks calmly. Soothingly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIOT>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot sighs wearily. He's had this conversation many times before.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people. You all say the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further away. Paul closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.
