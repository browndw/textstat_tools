TITLE AND CREDITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the main title, "CRYSTAL JAPAN" speeds straight at the audience in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The opening credits follow. Ominous theme music fills the soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE MARKET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting over a line of ruffled bushes with leaves just turning towards a rural, time-worn country market. A wide gravel parking area makes it accessible to the highway running past it, otherwise, this Mom & Pop store seems almost like a vision of times gone by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bushes and overgrown grass, unrestrained by any human care, strengthen the sense of isolation. The dying sun shoots its last rays through the trees behind the market.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The market has a battered second-story: the living quarters of the people running it. A truck roars by. Then silence, and then again the sound of the radio news report:
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Judging from the sheer brutality of the murders, police theorize that they must have been committed by at least four persons...

</RADIO_NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE / STORE - ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sagging clotheslines cluttered with drying laundry run across a narrow backyard, all the way to a rickety old shed. The clotheslines are supported by one solitary pole. Linen and garments billow in the rising evening breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold, foreboding music accompanies the camera as it moves toward a pair of flapping khaki pants and an olive green workshirt hanging side by side on the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The radio news report grows louder as the clothing snaps directly into the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_NEWSCASTER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...The sole survivor of the massacre has been taken under heavy sedation to County Hospital in Linfield for observation. She's been unable to provide police with any clues and is being kept under round the clock guard...

HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a man parts two shrouds of wet laundry, making his way back towards the house. This is HAROLD: 40ish, paunchy, unshaven and so clumsy that he hits the clothesline pole and knocks it down, burying himself under a heap of linen. A transistor radio pops out of the pocket of his threadbare shirt, still broadcasting the news. One of the upstairs windows opens with a creak, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold's wife, sticks her head out and looks into the backyard:
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(loud, harsh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamnit Harold! I spent all day yesterday washing your clothes and look what you're doing to 'em. Shows how much you care about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Harold watches her from under the pile of laundry. Then he grabs the radio, staggers up, increasing the radio's volume as he does so, to drown out the voice of his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above him, Edna raves on for a moment (we can't make out what she is saying), then furiously slams the window shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is musty and cluttered like an old attic. Edna stomps away from the window and turns her attention to the partially functional, old clunker of a black and white TV. She plops herself down onto the lumpy couch and picks up two knitting needles and returns to work on a sweater. A news report about the mass murders is being broadcast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - TV
</DIRECTION>
<TELEVISION_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...A police spokesman tells Eyewitness News that authorities have been combing the area since just before dawn. Reports of cannibalism and sexual mutilation are still unconfirmed... Nevertheless, these murders are already being called the most brutal in local history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELEVISION_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leans in to adjust the long rabbit-ear antenna, spreading the ears apart for a better picture. She listens intently.
</DIRECTION>
<TELEVISION_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The motive behind the grisly murders remains a mystery at this hour as does the identity of the killer or killers. The search continues for more bodies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELEVISION_REPORTER>
<EDNA>

(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, My God, My God.

<TELEVISION_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Residents of the Lake region are being urged to take extra precaution when approaching strangers and to report anything unusual to police, immediately. We'll be back with the weather forecast after this important message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELEVISION_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Visibly upset, Edna rises to her feet. She goes over to the door leading downstairs to the market, opens it and call out.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold, what're you doing down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
No response. She rushes to the window, jerks it open and sticks her head out.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold... I want to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKYARD - EDNA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the backyard. The laundry quietly swells in the wind. For an instant, a human form is visible between layers of drying clothes. From this distance, Edna can't make out who it is.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unnerved by the continuing noise of the TV, Edna goes back to shut it off. She quickly returns to the window and looks out again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDNA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No sign of anyone, but there is an empty span of clothesline where several articles of clothes were hung, only a second before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna runs for the apartment door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARKET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna flies down the stairs and enters the store from the back. The market is dark, save does shafts of dying sunlight through the grimy front windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans the few aisles back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
A big rabbit appears from behind an arrangement of Campbell's soup cans, and stands on its hind legs on the aisle, trying to guess Edna's next move. Still calling Harold, she turns; starts at the sight of the rabbit; she grabs a tomato from the produce display, throw it at the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God Damn pest, what are you staring at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
She misses, grabs more vegetables and hurls them at the rabbit. The rabbit dodges them, and scurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sunlight is almost gone, stretching the shadows even more. In her nightgown, Edna pushed open the creaky screen door and steps out into the backyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting towards her through the laundry flapping on the clothesline. As she touches a set of pajamas and finds out that they are still wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shoulder suddenly enters the flame, and someone's silhouette blocks the screen just for a couple of seconds, before the intruder slips behind another curtain of drying clothes, revealing Edna again: she's still checking the clothes and hasn't noticed anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes to where the trousers and workshirt were, and no longer. That's a shock, but she's not quite sure that they were here in the first place, so she goes on, and starts talking to herself to fortify her ailing courage.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ All Mighty, Harold, you just take what's yours and leave the rest for me to do. Very considerate!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(collecting the dry
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	laundry and putting
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
it in a basket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could at least finished the job. Do I have to do everything around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Edna hears a noise and whips around. Her imagination is working overtime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bedsheet is swelling slowly in the breeze, taking the shape of a human body. Is anyone behind it? Ominous music...
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold... I swear, sometimes you're such a child...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
She charges forward. She rips the sheet off the line and falls in a heap with it. There is no one behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns over and lays on her back. Above her, there's only the dark evening sky and the branches of a tree, rustling back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna gets up and quickly pulls the remaining laundry off the lines, tossing it into the basket. As she does, she passes near the wooden shed at the back of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shed door creak open. Edna turns around. Suddenly, there's a crashing noise from inside. That's enough for Edna... she hauls up the basket and rushes back inside the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARKET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white rabbit that gave Edna such a scare is now hopping across a row of canned goods. A man's hand enters frame and grabs the rabbit by the nape of its neck and lifts it off the shelf, into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Harold. He places the rabbit on his shoulder and grabs a jar of peanuts from the shelf. He twists open the vacuum- sealed jar and wolfs down a handful of its contents. With another handful, he feeds the rabbit, who sniffs and partakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold rescrews the lid and places it back on the shelf. He turns on the radio in his breast pocket. Music blares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his broom and starts sweeping down the aisle, the rabbit remaining contentedly on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold stops at the dairy case and grabs a half-gallon jug of milk. He breaks the seal and pulls off the cap. He first offers the rabbit a taste, then gulps down a swig himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACKGROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unidentified face, in soft focus, peers in through the storefront window then disappears almost as quickly. Harold is unaware.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screws the cap back on and replaces the jug in the case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of crunching and munching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold turns around. The the produce section, the cellophane packages of carrots on display are moving slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches in and pushes off the top few packages to reveal, underneath, another rabbit, a grey one this time, nibbling on a carrot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the rabbit out of the case and places it on his opposite shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(looking from one rabbit to the other)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry guys, it's back to the slammer before Edna make a fur coat out of ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
On his way to the back door, Harold passes a rack of cakes and pies. He stops long enough to open a box of six chocolate-covered donuts. He takes one out and shoves it into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unbeknownst to Harold, a human form in shadow appears at the back door. The door is quietly pushed open. Someone is watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera as stalker enters the store and moves slowly towards Harold, his back to us. Ominous music accompanies the approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Checks filled to capacity. Harold closes the package and puts it back in place on the rack, hiding it under several unopened packages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold turns. The stalker is right behind him, completely startled, he jumps back and chokes on the doughnuts. The rabbits hop off his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unexpectedly, Harold find himself face to face... with his wife, Edna.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I feed you enough for breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Harold doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor said you had to lose weight, didn't he? I try to help you but you sneak food behind my back. What am I gonna do with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, Harold bends down to retrieve the rabbits. He scoops them up in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And put those filthy animals back where they belong, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Harold exits by way of the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold puts the grey rabbit on his shoulder, the white rabbit remains wrapped in his arms. He swallows the rest of the doughnut in his mouth as he flips a flashlight out of his back pocket and ambles across the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light filters through the cracked walls partially illuminating a variety of tools, old barrels, various odds & ends - and a rabbit hutch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold flicks on the flashlight as he enters. The rabbit atop his shoulder jumps off and scurries away. The rabbit in his arms squirms and squeals. The animals sense that something is wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(stroking the white rabbit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you little guys so nervous about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
He scans the shed with the flashlight to locate the runaway as he tries to contain the jittery ball of fur in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight searches each corner, until the beam finally stops on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RABBIT HUTCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music pounds hard on the soundtrack, as through the hutch grillwork we can see a mass of dead rabbits, lying one next to the other, staring up with glinting, glass eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold stands immobilized, in a state of shock. He looks down upon the limp bodies of his beloved pets, his face turned into a sad mask of outrage. He holds onto the white rabbit even tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would do this...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
Trembling, Harold reaches to lift the lid of the hutch. The music throbs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big timber rattlesnake springs out of the hutch, mouth wide and open, twin poisonous fangs shining in the beam of the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music drops out as the snake's loud kiss dominates. The muscles of its dark, lean body push the deadly mouth ahead, into the lens of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively, Harold slams the hutch down, dropping his flashlight and the white rabbit. The snake hisses and spits at the camera through the wife mesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Literally scared shitless, Harold races out of the shed, holding his stomach with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold dashes through the back door, and up the stairs like a charging bull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold bursts through the door, crashing into his unsuspecting wife. Edna is knocked off balance and tries to hold onto him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Harold can't talk. He rubs his stomach and heads straight for the bathroom, vanishing inside.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all the crap you've been stuffing yourself with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Edna turns up the volume on the TV and plunks herself down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for her knitting bag and empties its contents. One of her two, long, thin knitting needles is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(rummaging all around her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now where could that other needle have gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STOREROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is a combination: storing place mostly, there are two ample cupboards facing each other, each leaning against a wall, a mess of crates and boxes lying on top of each other behind a dusty curtain... and a toilet bowl, left from the days when this was just an oversized bathroom. The toilet bowl is against the fourth wall, at an angle behind the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the TV filters through the door as Harold, trousers down to his knees, sits on the toilet, sighing with relief as the first bout of diarrhea is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He loosens his collar, wipes some sweat from his brow, reaches behind the toilet tank, and produces a hidden bottle of Whiskey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unscrews the cap and takes a hardy swig. He leans back and shut his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those poor little creatures...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAROLD>
<DIRECTION>
Another swig. Some of the liquor spills over his chin and he wipes it with his sleeve. His eyes wander around aimlessly, then focus on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DUSTY CURTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
partially masking the mess of boxes and crates. It seems to ripple subtly, moved by an ever so slight movement of air, perhaps someone's breath?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold waits. The curtains seem still. Harold is about to relax when a brief, hollow noise is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold tries to locate the noise, but it's over before he can tell its source. Pants around his ankles, he rises, shuffles to one of the closets. It takes some courage to yank the door open, and the camera moves fast into a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLAT CLOSEUP of empty shelves - nothing has touched them in a long time, except dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing relief, Harold pulls up his pants again, just enough to be able to hobble grotesquely to the dusty curtain. He rips it apart, stares at the odd assortment of boxes and crates - empty, lifeless, and uncannily menacing because of their lifelessness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reassured, Harold gives the other closet a glance, almost decides against checking it - and then changes his mind, and stumbles, pants still around his ankles, towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks like this one hasn't been opened at all for a long time. Harold tugs at the door - a creak, followed instantly by a musical stinger as a huge hand holding a meat cleaver rips into the shot, strikes Harold, imbedding the cleaver in his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold manages a half-scream that mixes incongruously with the laughter from the TV in the living room. As the hand twists the cleaver, the scream becomes a raspy cough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harold stumbles backwards and crashes to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna hears the crash. She turns off the television.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. She gets up from the couch and goes to the bathroom door. She listens and hears the noise of the toilet flushing and flushing, as if someone's hand never released the lever.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(rattling the door knob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold... what's taking you so long in there? You all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes against the door. It doesn't budge. She looks down and notices some kind of liquid seeping out from underneath the bathroom door. She dips her fingers in it and sniffs.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whiskey, I thought so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes over to a desk, opens a small drawer and finds a skeleton key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries back to the bathroom/storeroom door, ready to insert the key. To her shock, the door is now open a crack!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Edna is nonplussed.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes the door - it swings open, revealing the open closets, the boxes and crates...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna steps inside and inadvertently kicks the half-empty bottle of Whiskey. She picks up the bottle while the flushing noise persists maddeningly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns toward the toilet, which is behind the door and screams at the sight of Harold sitting there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAROLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pants down, like a grotesque dummy, blood drooling out of the corners of his mouth, the meat cleaver sticking out of his chest and one elbow stuck against the flushing handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Whiskey bottle falls from Edna's hand, hits the floor and shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna screams uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind her a huge hand enters the flame and pierces the back of her head with the previously missing knitting needle. The needle is pushed out through her mouth, right at the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
she gags on her own blood and slums out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

EXT. WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group ethnic children are playing stickball in the street, weatherworn two and three-family houses on either side of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red passenger van screeches around the corner and heads down the block, slowing down as it advances on the oblivious children. The driver sounds the horn, warning of the van's approach. Most of the children scatter, but a few don't, yelling and banging on the sides of the van as it passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van continues for a few yards then parallel parks in the first available space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver Chris...19, blond, attractive but intense...steps down and circles around to the passenger side where two others jump out. They are Debbie...19, brown-haired, vivacious and healthy, the all-american cheerleader type...and Andy...slims, athletic and ruggedly handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one is it?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you gonna do?

</ANDY>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

Chris calls into the van once again.

	How about you two? You coming?

Two other voices shout back:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
(in unison)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
Chris throws up her hands in frustration, joining Andy and Debbie. They cross the street abreast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS in front of the three friends. A rotund, ominous-looking figure in a hideous, ghostly white mask springs out from around the hidden side of the van. The figure follows a safe distance behind the unsuspecting threesome, brandishing a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk, Andy and Debbie are locked in each other's arms and they begin to kiss. Chris looks at them and shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sex, sex, sex. You guys are getting boring, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie breaks the kiss, feeling a little embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?

Little by little, the masked figure advances from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Andy and Debbie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look guys, I don't want to ruin your weekend. What happened to me at the cottage happened a long time ago and I think I've worked that out. I'm all right now.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I? So don't embarrass me. When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.

Shelly puts on a pair of unflattering prescription glasses. Although he has a pleasant face, Shelly is overweight, greasy- haired and unkempt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and Debbie lead the way for Andy and Shelly up the porch steps, to the front door of a shabby, two-family house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris rings the bell. Shelly takes a few steps back. He mats down his unruly hair, tucks in his shirt and takes off his glasses. He's ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a middle-aged Hispanic woman stands behind the outer screen door.

She shuts the door in Chris' face. The group stands there not knowing what to do next. V.O.'s from inside the house they can hear Vera and her mother arguing in Spanish.

<DEBBIE>

They all turn to leave when suddenly the front door swings open. This time Vera, knapsack over her shoulder, ready to go, comes out onto the porch. She's a knockout...20, exotic, raven-haired beauty...in tight jeans. They turn and stare at her.

White smoke billows out of the van windows, engulfing the vehicle and the luggage tied to the top.

The whole group rushes off the porch and races to the van. The first one there, Andy, opens the passenger side door and jumps in. Chris runs around to the driver's side and does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through thick, acrid smoke, Chili and her boyfriend, Chuck... Cheech and Chong lookalies...can be seen sitting in the back on the floor, each puffing away like crazy on a bong filled with Marijuana. Each wears a stereo headset that is plugged into their own Sony Walkman portable cassette players.

REAR OF THE VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chili and Chuck are sprawled out on the floor, taking inventory of their numerous joints and bags of Marijuana.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shelly sits cross-legged near the very back of the van, opposite Vera, who sits with her legs open. Daydreaming, she gazes upward at the sky and treetops through the back window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shelly can't stop staring at Vera, admiring her sexy body. Vera senses that Shelly is undressing her with his eyes and quickly turns her head around and catches him looking at her breasts. Shelly averts his eyes in embarrassment and looks over at Chuck who lights up a joint, inhales and hands it Chili.

<SHELLY>

She offers the joint to Shelly. He declines. Chili offers it to Vera.
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, why not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<DIRECTION>
Vera comes forward on her hands and knees, reaching out for the joint. As she does, she inadvertently thrusts her shapely rear end almost into Shelly's face. Shelly makes no attempt to retreat from it. Actually he rather enjoys it.

Chris slows down the van. The group quickly moves forward and peers out the front windshield. One by one, a smile crosses each dour face.

The Three Motorcyclists have been pulled over by a State Trooper and are being ticketed.

INT. VAN

<DIRECTION>
The van erupts into laughter and cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>

As the van passes the powerless Cyclists, the side door swings open and the passenger window rolls down. The group sticks their heads out and jeers and applauds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris turns on the radio -- Rock 'n Roll MUSIC blares as the lighthearted atmosphere returns.

Jauntily, the van zips down the highway.

CLOSE SHOT on a half-eaten dead rabbit lying to one side of the dirt road. CAMERA DEEP-RACK-FOCUSES to the red van coming up over the hilly highway.

The van turns off onto the dirt road and makes its way through a wooded landscape along a winding trail. Sun dapples through the trees.

EXT. LAKESIDE COTTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An overgrown driveway meanders among oak trees towards a rustic two-story house. The oak trees have been there long before the house was built -- their heavy branches hang low, like tired arms, almost blocking the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house has an elevated porch and curtained windows. It is in relatively decent condition though weatherbeaten and creates from the start an impression of family history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is ample parking space before the house. On the left side of the driveway as one approaches, some thirty yards diagonally across from the house, there is a tall red barn with a hayloft equipped with a block and tackle (to bring up the bales of hay into the loft's square window).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the right of the house is an outhouse with a heartshaped venthole in its wooden door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the left of the house is a large lake with a knotty old dock and a small tree-covered island in the middle. The whole area is surrounded by a lush landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of a VEHICLE approaching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA reveals this serene, idyllic panorama and PICKS UP Chris' van as it bumps along the dirt road and slows down to a crawl to pass over a creaky, dilapidated wooden bridge that runs over a dried-up stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA peers OVER-THE-SHOULDER of an UNIDENTIFIABLE FIGURE as he moves from one living room window to the other, watching the van as it sweeps under the low branches towards the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van comes to a stop. Chris jumps out and looks towards the house. A collection of memories posses her for a moment before she reaches for the knotted rope and unties the tarp covering the bulk of the baggage on top.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(loud so the others can hear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's bring in the luggage first, then I'll give you a tour of the house and the barn and then we can hang out at the lake... All right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Just the distant SOUND of FEET RUNNING and LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris walks around to the other side of the van and finds the doors left wide open and no one about. She turns to see her friends running towards the lake, unable to resist the splendor of the shimmering water and sun dappled landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie turns back and gestures for Chris to join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>

In the background, behind Chris, the Shadowy Figure, OUT OF FOCUS, appears behind a curtain in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Debbie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna take my bags into the house first and look around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris turns toward the house. The Figure disappears from view. Chris grabs a piece of baggage in each hand and innocently strides up the path and porch steps to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has been a while since she has last visited the family country home and she is actually pleased to have this moment to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rifles through her handbag, comes up with the keys and reaches for the doorknob to find that the door is already open, ever so slightly. A look of concern flashes across Chris' face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Only the distant SOUNDS of her friends by the lake can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cautiously, Chris pushes the door. Creaking, it opens wide. She hesitates a moment then takes a step inside.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(hearing a noise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>

From out of nowhere, a hand grabs Chris by the neck and pulls her OUT OF FRAME. She SCREAMS!

	Okay. There's a whole weekend ahead of us. There's time.

Chris embraces Derek. Behind them, passing the porch windows, OUT OF FOCUS, is the shadowy figure of JASON. Neither Chris nor Derek is aware of the presence.

Chris moves around to the opposite side. The sliding door which was previously wide open is now closed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of the others thrashing about in the lake can be heard as Chris reaches for the handle and whisks the door aside. Instinctively, she braces herself, but nothing jumps out at her. Annoyed with herself for being so suspicious and jumpy, Chris just leans in and grabs for the first bag she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND springs INTO FRAME and wraps around Chris' wrist. She gasps and jumps back.

Shelly sticks his head out the side of the van.

Chili flicks a wall switch next to her. A naked light bulb springs to life, glowing dimly.

<CHILI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothin' to be afraid of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
She takes Chuck by the hand and leads him down the stairs. Their sneakers, sodden with water, squeak and squish as they go. Water drips from their hair and clothes, forming little puddles that follow their every step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The basement is overrun with cobwebs and spiderwebs. Rusted gardening tools, broken bicycle parts and boxes of old toys are strewn helter-skelter. An old washer and dryer sit just to the left of the electrical fusebox.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILI>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme your threads, man.

Chuck pulls off his shirt and hands it to Chili. She rings it out onto the floor creating a pool of water under the fusebox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Chuck zips down his pants, Chili turns on the dryer. Annoyingly, the dryer RATTLES and SHAKES.

Suddenly the light bulb goes off, plunging the twosome into near darkness.

FOREBODING MUSIC enters the SOUNDTRACK...

But yet, the dryer CLATTERS on.

From over by the stairs, the SOUND of a METAL OBJECT being kicked against the door.

Chili and Chuck whirl around to look.

A rusty old roller skate bounces down the stairs and hits bottom with a CLUNK.

Chris walks over to the windows and separates the curtains, flooding the room with light. She opens the windows -- a cool breeze blows in.

Debbie surveys the cheerful room with antique furniture that includes a folding. Japanese-style dressing curtain. But there is one important element missing in this bedroom... there's no bed.

	Uh, Chris... I don't mean to be picky, but... where do we sleep?

Debbie begins to unravel the nylon mesh when suddenly, a gust of wind topples over the Japanese dressing curtain. It hits the floor with a sharp SLAP. At the same exact moment, the door is kicked open with a BANG, SLAMMING against the opposite wall.

Debbie jumps. It's Andy. He squeezes through the door with the bulky baggage.

Leaning over the hole, Shelly wipes his mouth with his sleeve. Weakened and defeated, he sits down and leans his head back against the wall, closing his eyes.

An OMINOUS TONE enters the SOUNDTRACK...

From behind Shelly, the CAMERA MOVES past him and LOOKS OUT from the heart-shaped venthole carved in the door.

From this distant vantage point, WE CAN SEE up to a second- floor window where a shadowy figure (Jason) looks down from behind a sheer curtain.

The SCREAMING is nothing more than playful activity.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a window in the room SLAMMING shut. Startled, Shelly whips around to see the window beside the Japanese dressing curtain now closed. Dust around the window has been unsettled. The Japanese curtain wavers. Shelly cannot see behind it.

He edges over to the curtain and flings it aside. There's nothing there. He exits.

He walks to his room at the far end of the corridor and pushes on the door to open it. It doesn't budge. Leading with his shoulder, he bashes into the door. This time it gives. Shelly stumbles off-balance into the room (this is the same room which looks directly down on the outhouse)!

She reaches up to catch it, but it hits the side of her hand and drops to the floor.

Vera bends down to pick it up, but someone beats her to it. A black hand with rings on each finger scoops the wallet up first.

FOX... a Black woman outfitted in skin-tight black leather... holds the wallet. Vera and she have an immediate and mutual dislike for each other.

As she approaches the toolshed, one of her heels sticks deep into a sticky patch of mud and she falls forward off-balance. To stop her fall, Fox reaches out for the toolshed handle. She grabs it but the rotting old door tears off its hinges and she topples to the ground -- her face landing inches away from a pitchfork's prongs aiming upwards at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes focus on the sharp teeth of the pitchfork. Alarmed by the close call, Fox tosses the implement away, gets up and dusts herself off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking skyward to the loft area, Fox moves over to its ladder and starts up. The ladder quivers as she ascends, apparently dislodging a bale of hay at the top and sending it crashing towards her. (Or, was it Jason?) Fox swings her body out of the way just in time. The bale whizzes by her and hits the barn floor with a THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She continues up the ladder and disappears through the loft flooring.

Loco comes through the opening and steps onto the floorboard. The deep shadows hide the corners of the loft and Loco has to squint his eyes to see.

Right behind him, he hears the SOUND of the banging again. He whips around...

<DIRECTION>
MUSICAL STINGER...

In front of him, Fox's body, raised off the ground and impaled with a pitchfork through her and into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are open wide with a deathly stare while her feet kick against the wall with final spasms of life. Blood flows from the penetrations in her torso.

The horrific sight is even too much for Loco. He gags and grasps his mouth with his hand, choking back a scream.

He turns to run...

Another MUSICAL STINGER!

Loco's face registers shock and horror as he runs smack into the teeth of an onrushing pitchfork being thrust at him.

He rages over to the ladder and looks up. His eyes widen and mouth drops open. Directly above him, Loco, the pitchfork still protruding from his stomach, falls through the opening in the loft floor, right at Ali.

The two crash to the barn floor, together. Ali throws Loco's body off of him and struggles to his feet. He backs away, fixated on Loco's engorged corpse and cries out for Fox -- a deep, moanful bellow.

	When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late. My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me. I was so upset... I told them I slept with you. My mothers slapped me. That was the first time she'd ever hit me. I couldn't believe it. I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying. They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that. I decided to hide out all night. They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me. The woods were cold and damp from the rain. I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.

He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again. I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away. I ran and ran, but he kept coming. He was big but so fast. He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me? Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the figure releases her limbs and submerges underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera pulls herself back up onto the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clad in a black scuba suit and white faceless mask, the rotund figure rises out of the water onto the shore. In one hand he holds a small spear-gun. With the other, he removes his mask. It's Shelly!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera glares at him.

<SHELLY>

EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shelly trudges up the front walk to the porch and plops himself down on the porch swing, still clutching the mask and spear-gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a contemplative mood, he slowly swings back and forth. The taut metal chains that support the swing, vibrate and CREAK in a steady rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shelly looks down at the lake.

SHELLY'S SWINGING POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera sits back down on the dock, facing away from the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHELLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is alerted to what sounds like the cry of a wounded animal emanating from the barn. He looks over and sees a shadow cross in front of one of the windows. The cry continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shelly jumps off the swing and heads for the barn with his mask and spear-gun at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARN - NIGHT

Shelly comes up to the window and looks in. It's too dark to see anything.

<SHELLY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELLY>
<DIRECTION>
He finds the switch and FLICKS on the light. The very moment the light goes on, an OWL swoops down and aims straight for his head (and CAMERA). Shelly drops the spear-gun and the mask to thwart off the bird with his hands. The owl flies out of the partially open barn doors. Shelly quickly closes them.

<DIRECTION>
Vera is pacing, back and forth, on the dock. She stops at the far edge and peers into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floating by is a woman's bra (probably, Debbie's).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera smirks as she lies prone on the boards and reaches with her hand, grabbing the undergarment and rescuing it from the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans back into a kneeling position and rings out the soggy bra. Her heels dig into the rear pocket of her jeans, pushing a wallet out of the pocket onto the dock. Vera reaches behind her and picks it up. It's Shelly's wallet -- the one he gave her at the liquor store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leafing through the contents, Vera finds his driver's license and a photograph of Shelly and his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around. Shelly is nowhere in sight. Assuming he has returned to the house, she gets up to look for him -- as she rises, her hand knocks against the dock. The wallet slips out her her grasp and bounces into the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
<DIRECTION>
(watching the wallet sink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment of deliberation, she takes off her shoe and plunges into the water, diving after the billfold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swims around underneath the surface, searching with her hands. She rises for air periodically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She submerges deeper than the previous attempts. Air bubbles rising to the surface, establish her whereabouts -- a good distance from the shore.

She comes up for air once more, empty-handed.

VERA'S POV

OMINOUS MUSIC throbs on the SOUNDTRACK...

Jason raises the spear-gun to eye level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera swims unknowingly toward her demise. A few yards from the dock, she glides right into Shelly's floating wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason aims the spear-gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera, grabbing the wallet, she treads water and raises it triumphantly over her head for "Shelly" to see.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN towards the hammock which wildly rocks bath and forth accompanied by the sounds of lovemaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie and Andy are not visible in full -- only glimpses of their naked limbs and torsos can be seen above the curved side of the hammock. Blankets and sheets hang sloppily over the edges to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA continues to DOLLY IN as the SOUNDS grow more heated until Debbie and Andy are FRAMED in a TWO SHOT as they climax.

The thrashing about stops and the hammock slows down to a gentle swaying.

	I'm seasick. Get in or get out of the boat.

Debbie luxuriates in the soap and hot water.

Distorted through the plastic curtain, the door opens.

Debbie remains blissfully unaware as she soaps her face. She hears a BANGING NOISE. Her eyes are closed due to the soap and shower spray.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Concerned, Debbie turns off the water and wipes the soap from her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up, she sees a shadowy figure poised in front of the curtain. Quickly, she reaches out and rips the curtain aside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring her in the face is a pair of men's feet and jean- covered legs. It's Andy, walking on his hands.

An OMINOUS TONE enters the SOUNDTRACK, a haunting counterpoint to Andy's WHISTLING.

Jason's hulking frame is braced up against the wall in the hallway corridor at the entrance to the bedroom. Andy is unaware of Jason's presence as he hand-walks right past his boots towards the staircase.

The CAMERA MOVES slowly IN CLOSE on Debbie as she steps but of the tub and dries herself off.

She hears a CRASHING SOUND that seems to have come from the bedroom. She stands still and listens.

She SLAMS the door shut! Peeved at Andy, she picks up a book (Stephen King's newest novel) from a table and rolls into the hammock top of the covers which hang all the way to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She settles in. The hammock sways slightly. She finds her place in the book and playing with her damp hair, she starts to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quite unexpectedly from above her, a large drop of blood falls and splatters all over the white pages of her book. Alarmed, she touches the fluid with her finger tips, examining it.

From beneath the hammock, hidden by the covers, Jason's hand reaches up and around and snaps her head back down, pinning her to the pillow.
