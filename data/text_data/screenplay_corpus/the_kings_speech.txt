PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which he's been bedecked.
</DIRECTION>

Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:

Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.
</DIRECTION>

Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH - considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land, truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously, creating a happy chaos.

BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators, prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs, agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.

REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.

<DIRECTION>
A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the control room.

EXT. WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas hiding the spectators from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and uniform, accompanied by his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed, balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed. His hair, as always, parted down the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin, lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening, even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.

</KING_GEORGE_V>
<DIRECTION>
Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots, chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter. A man who cannot speak in public.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lang whispers to Churchill. When Lang whispers, everyone can hear.

<COSMO_LANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage for all the world. And on such an important occasion.

The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her features.

Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed, and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.

On the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers. Viewing stands are beginning to fill.

The King's voice is heard:

INT. THE KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The King's study resembles a naval captain's cabin. Both men are uniformed for a state occasion. Bertie regards the BBC microphone as though it were an alien.

</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
In the presence of his father, Bertie's stuttering returns in full form, his breathing short and shallow, the muscles in spasms.
</DIRECTION>
<KING_GEORGE_V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show who's in command. If you don't, this devilish device will change everything. Used to be, all a King had to do was look reasonable in uniform and not fall off his horse. Now we must creep cap in hand into people's homes that smell of boiled cabbage, and speak nicely to them. We're reduced to that lowest, basest of all creatures...we've become...actors! Don't give me a look of defeated pathos. This is a family crisis!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING_GEORGE_V>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, we're not a family, we're a firm.

His father shoots Bertie a surprised look. Does the lad have a brain after all?
</DIRECTION>
<KING_GEORGE_V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're the oldest, most successful, corporation in the world and sitting on thrones is our business! But any moment now we may be out of work. Your brother came to me the other day, livid a certain lady has been refused an invitation to my Silver Jubilee. I pointed out she wasn't a lady and most definitely wasn't his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING_GEORGE_V>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did David say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<KING_GEORGE_V>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She made him sublimely happy. I said: that was probably because she was sleeping with him. "I give you my word we've never had immoral relations." "As my son, as Prince of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear your friendship with this woman is an absolutely clean one?" "I do", he said. "Look me in the eye," I said. "On my honour" he said. Stared straight at his father... and lied.

	Oh my brother...

</BERTIE>
<KING_GEORGE_V>

	When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months. Who'll pick up the pieces? David's friend, Oswald Mosley? His black-shirt British Union of Fascists are marching through London. Hitler terrorizing half of Europe, Stalin the other half. Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The edge of the crowd is visible. One can sense a vast sea of humanity. When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the murmur becomes a ROAR. When the King steps out, it becomes tumultuous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries. The noise is deafening. The King beckons impatiently for someone still inside to join them. It's Bertie, with Elizabeth.

The King goes back to waving. Elizabeth is stunned at the prospect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral. WORKERS are lined up dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie's lips move, but with the noise he cannot be heard. Elizabeth watches in relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals. The machinery halts, the factory falls silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries Bertie forward.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's needed is cooperation...

	He can bugger things up! And I am not the King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce. The Coronation is set for the 12th of May. Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April. That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest.

All the old symptoms reappear: the tightening of the neck muscles, the protruding Adam's apple, the jaw locking.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke. Which makes him a Lord at the very least.

<WINSTON_CHURCHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, Lord E.W. it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINSTON_CHURCHILL>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons. Heading a King's Party.

</BERTIE>
<COSMO_LANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unacceptable!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COSMO_LANG>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's Party? Is that acceptable?

</BERTIE>
<WINSTON_CHURCHILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINSTON_CHURCHILL>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords.

	Fret not. As I assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech.

<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the war came, by the time I was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest. Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I found I had to go deeper, as you might well imagine.

<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know nothing of those poor men!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you do. They had cried out, and the universe had not listened. So they'd lost faith in their voice. My job was to make them shout in righteous anger: "I have the right to be heard!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose that helped them, did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<LIONEL>

</BERTIE>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a lot of success. No training was given. Not in Western Australia, not at that time. I simply knew what to do. When the war was over I kept being a therapist to earn a living. When the lads were old enough, I thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go." I pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.

	...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. This is the ultimate issue which confronts us.

	<DIALOGUE>
	For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.

	We may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which, in my closing words, I would like to say to you: `I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way.'" May the Almighty Hand guide and uphold us all.
