EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY

Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty. Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a hand around his shoulder.

INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard. Their cell has temporarily been converted into a makeshift BARBERSHOP. CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by Max the Barber. Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.

	All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, so...

Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back a little bit...

INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a sports bag, zips it up. Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got everything, kid?

</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean like a pyramid scheme?

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A shitty apartment. Tiny. A bed. A desk. The TV is on low. Henry sits on a chair by the bed, the box between his legs, its contents spread out over the bed. Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico with Debbie. A Baseball glove. A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos. He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUY" He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover, graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes" Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He finishes putting everything back.

A distinctive JINGLE! on the TV. Henry looks over. An ad for the local Buffalo lottery, a PRETTY YOUNG BLONDE in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera.

EXT. FIELD - DUSK

A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch. Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's hand. He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower poking through the dirt.

<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he contemplates the place... Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in. There's something happening, he's not sure what it is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing.... A moment of revelation. He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now, heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --
