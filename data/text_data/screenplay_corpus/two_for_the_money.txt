Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM. It's a night game. Stands packed. A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN. It's the fourth quarter. Seven seconds left. Score: CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27. A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back to the huddle. The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. 10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S every word --

<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last play. Slant red, right back on two. On two, Scottie. It's a lock. A guaranteed TD. I've already seen it. So relax. There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear any "Hi moms." Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me. See you in the end zone.

BRANDON drops back. A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey. BRANDON pulls free, runs. OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.

He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right. He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field. Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.

BRANDON opens the drawer, pulls an envelope and a ticket.

	That's travel cash and an airline ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon. I paid someone to put it there, who incidentally said the place reminded him of a Turkish prison. I don't have to tell you you're wasting your time there, Brandon, unless this is a part time gig -- unless you're planning some kinda "comeback," in which case I request you use a fraction of your talents and weigh the odds of that dream becoming reality. Two leg fractures? Passed on by every conceivable team in the league? Any chump can make that call, and anyone who clears the boards the way you do week in and week out should live in a penthouse on Park Avenue -- which is not for you to construe I'm offering that to start, but keep these stats up working for me and I'll have you in one in less than a year.

BRANDON follows MILTON through a large, wildly furnished apartment. They pass an large library dominated by rows of bleacher seats from the old Polo Grounds.

WALTER smokes a cigarette, talking on the phone as an ASSISTANT in a separate, adjoining space handles four ringing phones. Across the room, a large wall is filled with TVS, each turned to a different channel, no sound.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll hire the trainers too... Well run it by them, you won't know until you try... So, they can stay the night. I'll put 'em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view... Okay double it... Triple it... Everything's about money. Look, on Sunday, my daughter, an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again. She loves elephants. Your circus has 10, I only want one, my little girl's happiness is in your hands.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity. There are rules to success, Brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you know and know what you don't know and know I gotta know everything you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner! Smile. C'mon! What the hell is that? I said smile. Bigger. Hungrier. More teeth. Ever sell before?

<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That was six years ago.

</BRANDON>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. You think I went to college? I'm autodidactic. Big word, huh? Know what it means? Self-taught. Partially by reading, sure, but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions. I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years ago. A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable.

WALTER crushes out the cigarette, sprays air freshener.

	I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things. It's bad for my condition. So before I die, did you do anything other than the sports phone in Vegas?

	Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got 10 bucks a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDON>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chump change, Brandon. We're angling for bigger fish here. You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. These gamblers have needs, Brandon. Come Monday morning, after a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER presses a button and the TVS fill with football games.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's every pro game played last Sunday. Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday. Sports betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. We make the big money off our client list. You see, when a client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they gladly give to keep getting our picks. When they lose we get zip. So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend -- is to win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
WALTER clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs. Phone numbers and messages ("FOOTBALL SELECTIONS!" COLLEGE AND PRO!" "BASKETBALL PICKS!") flash on the screens. It's a high-octane infomercial for sports gamblers.

	Hello -- this is Walter Abrams and welcome to The Sports Advisors and week three in professional football. After a nice five day vacation on my yacht I can't be any more ready than I am right now. Studying the mismatches this weekend I can only conclude they're giving my handicappers a license to steal. I want you to take out a blank check right now -- go on, do it -- and write in as much you want to cash it for on Tuesday, that's how much money we're making for you this weekend. Year in, year out, no stock matches our return, and for the first time in the history of the company I'm releasing our three-team college and pro parlays absolutely free! That's right. This is why in a business with a higher turnover rate than Leona Helmsley's maid staff we're still going strong after 28 years! I'm giving these picks away. 800-238-6648. 1-800-BET-ON-IT. Absolutely free. We're looking at a big money weekend so let's get right into it with our panel of experts--

	Walter's got a weird sense of humor. Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working for him, but he's held together by meetings. If it has "anonymous" at the end, Walter goes. He has to. He also has to be very careful who he let's into his life. In most ways, Walter's brilliant -- but he can be bullshitted and I can't. So he sends 'em over to me before he hires 'em.

PULL BACK TO SHOW -- BRANDON comes out of the shower, towel around his waist, putting on a clean shirt. Through a ground floor window the boardwalk can be seen. A child's party is in progress. The elephant ambles by wearing a birthday hat, the bemused TRAINER walking beside him. TONI and WALTER are seen arm-in-arm with their 6-year-old daughter, JULIA. WALTER crosses the lawn, looks through the window.

BRANDON'S switching between football games blaring from the tv. A radio blasts scores and updates. WALTER knocks on the window, mouths "How we doing?"

	It's a waste, Walter. He hardly drinks.

	I was a lot of things, Walter, but I was never a drunk.

</TONI>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. I had a check-up yesterday. Afterwards he was very concerned. He sat me down, looked me in the eye and said, "Walter, who do you like in the Buffalo/Oakland game?"

</WALTER>

WALTER laughs. He reaches to Toni's plate, lifts a dessert pitcher.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>

	You didn't touch the sauce.

TONI shoots him a look and WALTER quickly sets down the sauce.

</WALTER>
<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very.

</BRANDON>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can tell. Don't be. Ever. One week's over, another begins. The past is merely a prologue. In this job you have to push the envelope every day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
BRANDON glances at a nearby table, catches the eye of a stunning GIRL sandwiched between two middle-aged, overweight MEN. WALTER catches the eye contact before she looks away. The GIRL seems bored as the two big men heartily chow down.

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that. Beauty and the beasts. What do you think of her, Brandon?

</WALTER>
<BRANDON>

	She's cute.

</BRANDON>
<WALTER>

	Cute doesn't half cover it. The girl's gorgeous. And bored out of her mind. Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas. Check it out. She's eyeing you again, Brandon.

<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So are the two guys she's with.

	C'mon Walter. You might as well go to Atlantic City and open a house account. You know you can't gamble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONI>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's gambling? It's a challenge. If Brandon leaves with her I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year. If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give to you.

(talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt but I have to know what's going on here. You're drop dead gorgeous and your dates look like they haven't missed a meal since Christ died. Seriously, you two are eating like you have a date with the electric chair. What's the story with you three? I'm not gonna sleep if I don't know. Lemme guess. Garment district. The Hardy boys make lingerie and you're a model. That it? Close? Sprechenzee English? Sit down, sit down -- I'm just joking. I better stop before I get stabbed with a fork. Bon apetit.

	Pushing people? Get real, this country was built on gambling. Look at Wall Street -- one big casino. The state spends millions hawking the lottery. If people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no? Stop being selfish, spread the word! Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive.

<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent winners. What's the matter? Gonna lose your purity? C'mon, what do you think selling is? We're just talking a few well-timed phrases. Let's start with an easy one. A throw-away. "I don't want your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?"

</WALTER>
<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want your money --

<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that I can't. Why do I have to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDON>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can. Fuck is your friend. Fuck can be your best friend.

<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I mean you'd think with two mortgages out, repo guys staking out my car, my job on the line and my wife threatening to leave, you'd think I'd have the goddamn brains to stop, instead of staying in the chase, doubling down, which of course is what I did... I know I'm sick because I keep thinking if I just pulled that game out then I got a lock on the parlay and I'm flush going into Monday night and--

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon here, and I gotta say, Leon -- if I learned one thing it's that gambling is not your problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<LEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEON>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even close. You're a lemon. Like a bad car, there's something inherently defective in you. And you. And me! All of us here -- we're lemons! Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! We look like everyone else but we're defective because when most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into the void! And we like doing it so much we do it time after time after time! Me? I always felt most alive when they were raking away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time before we give it all back. But when we lose, and I mean the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still alive! In order to really live you have to be aware of your own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the best ways I know of getting that feeling. When you win, you defy death, but when you lose, you survive it, and that's remarkable! Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose! We need to constantly remind ourselves that we're alive! Gambling's not the problem, Leon, your fucked up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist, to test what's really real, that's the problem!

	Welcome to this week's edition of The Sports Advisors! America's premier sports information program with myself, Walter Abrams, Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler and a truly gifted newcomer to the Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find -- John Anthony! We're entering week six in pro football! This is when the cream rises to the top! This is when things get hot! It's oven mitt time! This is big-time ball season so let's get right into it with the Wizard of Odds -- Jerry "The Source" Sykes! Jerry, what's the Sykes System predicting for this weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECH>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, my patented computer models tell me we're looking at nothing less than the perfect storm of betting opportunities. But first, last week I cashed in a big-time call on on Chicago as an outright winner over Indianapolis -- making it my 8th straight top selection winner right here on this tv show! This Sunday I have 5 match-ups I absolutely love, including Miami at New York! Stats, rankings, records, weather, the Sykes System uses 42 proven indexs to eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering. Without my patented, computer-based picks you have a better chance of seeing God knocking on your door with five strippers and a bag of Bolivian cocaine than winning on your own! Call me for my five games! Absolutely free -- 800-238-6648!

	Hell yes -- with a side order of fried bookmaker!!! I'm the grim reaper of bookmakers! I've put more bookies out of business than the I.R.S.! How many gamblers did I bail out last weekend with my game of the year! Denver, a 10- point underdog beating Cincinatti by two touchdowns! A $100 bettor made $10,000! A $500 bettor made $50,000! I've got six games on Sunday I'm releasing absolutely free! These games are a burial! A blow-out! A human lock! You can bet your children's unborn children's children on these six games -- ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Someone wrote some great stuff for me here but the "Million Dollar Man," I dunno, it sounds kinda small somehow. I mean maybe if you change that M in million to a Z I could get behind it. They tried all sorts of names, wanted to call me the Magic Man -- but picking 80 percent winners sounds pretty scientific to me. So let's just call me John. I was a quarterback. And every QB knows the key to victory is anticipating -- the ability to see the future and react to it. That is what I do, that's the truth, and what do they say about the truth, Walter?

</JERRY>
<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, but with me it makes you M-O-N-EE! I'm picking 80 percent, is that unbelievable? Well it used to be. I know the leagues! I know the players! I know the game! I'm your friend on the field! Your insider on the outside! You can't do what I do if you haven't been there! Played at the level I have! Maybe you'll get lucky -- guess right once in a while -- but these match- ups won't be called consistently by anything other than experience! Forget trends! Throw out every system you possess! Keep your friends but toss their opinions out the window! It's time to change I-would-if-I-could to I-can-and-I-am! You wanna know who I like -- call that little number at the bottom of your screen!

Get 'em primed for the weekend. Chuck got drunk, took a swing at one of the deer heads on the wall. Just blowing off steam. I'm gonna hire more guys Monday. Put in more phones. Everything's amping up. It's okay. There's room. I'll tear down a few walls, fit another 10 desks down there easy. I'm gonna do a whole dot-com thing around him! Oh shit, if I had me when I was his age... I never had a protege. Someone you hand it all down to. Anything happens to me, he steps in! Just knowing that, with the thing... I mean that's just beautiful!

Now I don't know, Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't. I don't see you taking that chance. My gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet. And if you do, fuck it. I give a shit? The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him--

If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it. Or ask for it. You gotta earn it. You gotta fight for it. You gotta rip it out of my fucking talons. John Anthony would know that. That's what he'd do. As a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony. 'Cause from now on I'm not talking to you about money.

I got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway! All this -- everything you see around you -- is smoke and mirrors! I shoulda been a magician! ... What'd you say when you came in?

	--You can pick again! Of course All you gotta do is go back to being Brandon! Talk like Brandon! Eat like Brandon! Forget John Anthony! Burn the suits! It's all my fault. I see that now. I pushed you into something you weren't. I took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a duck. We're winding down the season. There's only two games this weekend. Two winners and two over/unders. That's all we need. You crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little Brandon magic, we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday we go four for four going into the big game! Right? Huh? Let's get something to eat! Go to Smith and Wo's!

We start cutting from the game to BRANDON, to WALTER, the SALESPEOPLE, JULIA, all reacting as the betting Gods raise hopes one play, dash them the next. Play after play. Tide going for New York one minute, Atlanta the next. Tension in the room building. Everyone crowds the TVs as New York defends a 10 point lead with a minute left. 37 points on the board. Only an Atlanta TD can lose the two bets and they're 80 yards from scoring. A few high fives as Atlanta fumbles on a run, recover the ball for a five yard loss. Backed up to their own end zone. Two plays left. WALTER excited, things going their way and --

	I think you do. The best part of the best drug in the world isn't the high. The best part is the time just before you take it! The dice are dancing on the table. Between now when they stop -- that's the greatest high in the world!

INT. SALES OFFICE - DAY

Mayhem. Loud and crowded. They can't answer the phones fast enough. A big screen TV is set up in front. The Superbowl pre-game show is seen coming to an end. SALESMEN machine-gun last minute calls. Scribble like mad.

WALL OF TVS, the ball's kicked and the game begins -- the SALESROOM explodes in cheers after a good play -- PLAYERS collide -- a fumble bounces across the field -- SALESMEN clamber atop desks for a better view -- WALTER in agony after an interception, a moment later elated when a flag brings the play back -- the score board FILLS FRAME, New York trails 14/7 at the half and --

Walter walks back to the bedroom. The tv's on. WALTER pauses to watch another play, about to leave when he spies the Rolex on the nightstand, envelope beside it. WALTER picks up the letter. Sees his name on the outside. He opens it, reads. TONI appears in the BG. WALTER turns.

	Something was bothering him. I mean sure, maybe he was homesick. Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings for me he couldn't face saying goodbye. What a minute.

	You were gambling with me that night, Walter. Brandon knew it. Knew you. He told me he was sure you were watching somehow. So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show. I didn't believe him -- I mean after all we've been through -- but I figured what the hell. He slipped out the back, didn't even stay here. And you... you were in such a good mood the next day. I figured he must have been wrong. Otherwise why wouldn't you confront us? Confront me?

Your fantasy's to end up alone with nothing! Well I won't let that happen to you! Understand? I will never let that happen! This is it! We're all we have, Walter! All we're ever gonna have!

CAMERA on the tv. Blaring the game. Bar going crazy as the New York QUARTERBACK runs for the end zone. Juking LINEMEN. Dodging tackles. Nearing the goal. A last-second block clears a lane and the QUARTERBACK barrels by, dives -- a hit -- a fumble on the goal line -- a beat -- a replay -- a REFEREE signaling a touchdown -- and the game's over -- and New York has won, but more importantly they've covered the spread and --
