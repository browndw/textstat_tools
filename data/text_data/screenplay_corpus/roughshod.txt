There are four women in the two-seated surrey, which is heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. Mary Wells, the loveliest of the four, is driving. She is more poised, more self-assured than the others. Her clothes, though a trifle showy, are attractive. She wears a large spectacular hat. Helen Carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside her. In the seat behind are Marcia Paine, placid, younger looking than her years, and Elaine Ross, a striking blonde with a pale haunted face. Elaine is obviously ill. Mary is riding the brake and holding the team back.

CLOSE SHOT. A woman's hat lies on the rocky earth. It is a big, elaborate affair. O.s. there is the SOUND of hoofbeats, the SQUEAL of a wagon brake and the JANGLE of harness. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Clay's wagon coming down a very steep hill. Steve is driving, holding tightly to the reins and riding the brake. Seeing the hat, he yells to Clay.

ANGLED DOWN hill. The road twists tortuously down. Near the bottom it swings sharply at right angles into a dry wash. The banks shut out further view of the road. Near where the road turns a trunk lies at the side. It has broken open and some of the contents are spilled out in the dust. Clay rides to it, reins in his horse and looks down. Steve, with difficulty, pulls the mules to a stop alongside.

A blanket is spread in the scant shade thrown by the surrey. On it lies Elaine and, sitting beside her, is Marcia. A damp cloth is spread across Elaine's forehead. A water bag hangs from the surrey.

The caravan can be seen as it halts in the lush grass a few yards from the stream. The girls sit lifelessly on the wagon; they seem too tired to dismount. Then, finally, Marcia helps Elaine to climb stiffly down. With the exception of Mary they all let themselves down in the grass. Mary walks to the head of the team and starts fumbling with the harness. Steve comes into the scene, dismounts quickly and pulls the saddle off his horse. The remuda has fanned out, the horses moving toward the water. Steve crosses to Mary and takes over the job of unbuckling the harness. Mary smiles gratefully and rubs her hand across her face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave that unharnessing for me, Ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary smiles after him, then moves across the grass, CAMERA DOLLYING AHEAD of her. She sinks to her knees in the patch of sand by the stream and leans down and puts her face under the water. Then, sitting up, she wipes the water and dust from her face with a handkerchief. Clay rides up from behind, dismounts, scoops up some water from the river in the brim of his hat and drinks it. For a second he watches Mary.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a place down a ways, where you and the girls can wash some of that dust off.

Mary's manner is business-like. She and the girls are along for the ride. She wants no favors -- wants to do her part.

Green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white- washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around the house, which stands in a clump of trees.

His companions, McCall and Peters, also wear black leather jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. They are mounted on matched roans. The horses are winded, lathered and dirty.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING PAST Mary. The door slowly opens. Wyatt enters. He crosses to the bedroom door, CAMERA PANNING WITH him. It is as though he doesn't see the two women. He stands in front of the door, staring at it. Then his hand moves to the knob. Slowly he turns the knob and opens the door. The two girls watch him as he hesitates on the threshold. Then he enters and closes the door softly. Helen looks over at Mary and smiles.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT as Wyatt stops, looking at Elaine, resting back against the pillow, seeming very young in the nightgown. For a moment it is difficult to know what is in Wyatt's mind. Then he sees the twin tintypes. CAMERA MOVES TOWARD Wyatt's face as tears come to his eyes.

The room is lighted only by the moonlight. Mary and Helen are in the big four poster bed, close to the window. Clay's footsteps are heard on the porch. The kitchen door closes softly. There is the rattle of a stove lid being lifted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're figuring on asking me to take you, it's no use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary crosses to stand above him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A time like this people ought to be alone. Having us around is going to make it sort of hard on 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary sighs, sits beside him. From the pocket of her robe she takes tobacco, rolls a cigarette and lights it. She passes the tobacco to Clay. He rolls one.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>

(on the defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.

<MARY>

<CLAY>

Mary strikes a match and holds the flame to his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

</MARY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.

</MARY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should know. She's in your dream.

</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay puts his cup down, looks up. She is very lovely standing in the moonlight, her body arched back, the robe open a little.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pauses)
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(enigmatic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on. Tell me more about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make the soap myself.

</MARY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will she be dark or fair?

</CLAY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Straightening, she crosses the porch to pause momentarily close to Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you find her -- because, like I said, you've earned your dream. Goodnight.

<HELEN>

She closes the door behind Mrs. Wyatt and comes back, sits on the edge of the bed and holds the cup to Elaine's lips.

<DIRECTION>
As he lights the fire, the lower portion of Mary's body comes into the shot. Clay becomes aware of her closeness. He rises slowly. CAMERA ANGLES UP. Mary is standing facing him, almost touching him. They stare at each other without speaking. Both suddenly move togother. They kiss. There is a SOUND over shot and they step apart, looking off.

Clay and Steve. CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of them as they walk toward the wagon. Steve has begun to whistle blithely. Clay looks sideways at him. Steve whistles even louder. They stop at the wagon. CAMERA HOLDS. Steve climbs inside and hands down the grub box.

	When you get older you'll understand things better. Like women and men. Just because a man kisses a woman, doesn't always mean -- well, he can kiss her and not want to -- have her around all the time.

Steve watches him, puzzled. His exuberance has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>

Clay in the f.g. In front of Clay stretches the meadow with the river beyond. The horses are grazing in the meadow. Fowler can be seen hurrying toward the aspens and alders that screen the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT. Here the river moves quietly down. The bank is sandy. Alders and aspens screen it from the meadow. Helen sits on the sand taking off her shoes and stockings. Her toilet box is beside her. Something on the bank catches her attention, she rises and climbs the bank. Some branches of aspen cover an object. She pulls the branches away, revealing a crud, miner's cradle or rocker.

Fowler comes over and sits down beside her. He takes [a] sack of tobacco and papers from his pocket. She reaches for them. He watches her wide-eyed as she rolls a cigarette. He holds a match for her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the toilet case on the sand beside her, takes out a comb. He glances at the box, then reaches over and from it takes her powder box. He sniffs it. Without irritation, as though borrowing a toy from a child, Helen takes the powder box from him.
</DIRECTION>
<FOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sure smells good.

</FOWLER>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

She looks at him then up the bank where the cradle is.

<HELEN>

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Fowler hesitates. Helen hands him back the powder box as matter-of-factly as she took it. He accepts it gratefully, again putting it to his nose. Now he looks up at her, regarding her calculatingly for a moment or two. Their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<FOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you can keep a secret. That's a gold rocker. I'm doin' a little placer mining in a place nobody ever thought to look for gold before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches to his throat and lifts over his head a braided loop of rawhide. Attached to the loop is a small, plump, soft-leather poke. Still holding the powder box, he passes her the poke. She starts to work with the thong.
</DIRECTION>
<FOWLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at her -- see her shine. One week's work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOWLER>
<DIRECTION>
Helen still struggles with the thong. He takes the poke, pulls it open, pouring grains of gold into his palm. Helen looks at the shining heap in his hand. Then she takes the poke and pours some of the grains in her own palm. She looks down at it. Her expression is calculating. She looks up at Fowler and then the hard look goes away. She gives him a soft smile.

For answer, Clay kisses her again -- hard, ruthlessly. His hands crush her shoulders. Mary holds the kiss for a moment, then draws back, waiting for him to say the words she wants to hear. His hands pull her toward him. Mary wants the kiss -- but she also wants a declaration of love. She makes one last try to get it.

<MARY>

EXTREME LONG SHOT. The long pine-covered approaches, and the glistening summit; the early snow covering the rocks with a thin layer of white. CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM the heights of the mountains, TO the narrow trail that winds among the trees. Clay passes, and behind him the pack-horses and the romuda. Following the remuda comes Mary. She is dressed in a pair of Steve's pants and wears one of his shirts under her own coat.

MED. SHOT. Fowler is putting the supper dishes up on the shelves beside the fireplace. The camp is cleaner than it was earlier in the day. It is evident that he has gone to great pains to make his visitor comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mirror has been tacked up on a tree, and under it is a wash basin. Fowler's rifle and shotgun are in a rack near the fireplace. Helen's trunk stands open near the lean-to. Helen, wearing a robe, takes some clothing from it, closes the trunk.

The shelter is dark. Lednov strikes a match and looks around. The place is empty. There is a bunk, made up. On the left hand wall a curtain of gunny sacks covers the clothes hanging there.

Free for the moment, Helen launches an attack on McCall, who is getting ready to boot Fowler again. She is on him like a cat, swarming all over him. He defends himself. Helen is yelling furiously as she fights McCall.
