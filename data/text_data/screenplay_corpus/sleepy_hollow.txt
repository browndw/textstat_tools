EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Empty cobblestone streets are bordered by stately buildings. A rapidly CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT TITLE: New York City 1799.

<DIRECTION>
TWO CONSTABLES clamor around a corner, lanterns held high, listening. They disappear down an alleyway.

EXT. CITY WATERFRONT - NIGHT

ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson. The BELL is LOUDER here. The two constables arrive, searching, pistols drawn.

</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The constables hurry to the river's edge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down an embankment, the MAN, another constable, has his back to us. He's waist deep in dark water, throwing aside his ALARM BELL, struggling to pull something from the murk...
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your help with this.

Constable Two and Constable One move forward, wary.

The MAN turns. Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing but nervous and unsettled.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ichabod drags a bloated MALE CORPSE out from the water. He backs away, shaken, looks to the constables...

INT. CITY WATCHHOUSE, JAIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a dank, cavernous room, the distinguished HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse in a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two. Constable One and Ichabod are near, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<HIGH_CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGH_CONSTABLE>
<CONSTABLE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.

<DIRECTION>
Constable Two wheels the corpse down a RAMP to another room.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a moment, if I may...we do not yet know the cause of death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<HIGH_CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you find 'em in the river, cause of death is drowning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGH_CONSTABLE>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Possibly so if there is water in the lungs, but...by pathology we might determine whether or not he was dead when he went into the river.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<HIGH_CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut him up? Are we heathens? Let him rest in peace -- in one piece as according to God and the New York Department of Health.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGH_CONSTABLE>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod is about to protest, but stops himself, frustrated.

Two THUGGISH CONSTABLES -- different ones -- bring in a bleeding SEMICONSCIOUS MAN.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to him?

<THUGGISH_CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THUGGISH_CONSTABLE>
<DIRECTION>
The constables throw him against the bars of the slammer while one of them opens the cage door. With their leather truncheons, the cops beat their prisoner into the cage and lock him in.
</DIRECTION>
<HIGH_CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGH_CONSTABLE>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod hurries to follow his two constables and the corpse.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY WATCHHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metropolis thrives; horsedrawn vehicles plodding, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, MERCHANTS and TRADESMEN everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEN are held in chains and gibbets in front of the Watchhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY WATCHHOUSE, JAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We enter midway into a "Audition Scene." A row of CITY OFFICIALS are "auditioning" APPLICANTS (mostly obvious Cranks and Eccentrics) with Devices for crime fighting and crime solving. The Applicants are crowded together to one side, waiting their turn. Ichabod, holding only papers and books, is among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"On Stage" at this moment is an INVENTOR demonstrating his invention, of which more in a moment. Facing the "stage" is the BURGOMASTER, flanked by the HIGH CONSTABLE (who has a list of names) and various MAGISTRATES and ALDERMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Inventor is demonstrating a combination wallet and mousetrap.
</DIRECTION>
<INVENTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and in a few weeks, the plague of pickpockets will be a thing of the past!

He produces a fake hand-on-a-stick and does the business.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A stealthy hand dips into the gentleman's pocket...and -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVENTOR>
<DIRECTION>
There is the sound of the trap snapping shut and the Inventor withdraws the fake hand with its fingers chopped off. The Officials wince, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<BURGOMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. We will take your device under consideration, Mr. Vanderbilt... Next!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGOMASTER>
<DIRECTION>
A SPOTTY MAN starts dragging a man-sized cage contraption to center stage...while Ichabod tries to get the attention of the Officials.

</BURGOMASTER>
<SPOTTY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOTTY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns proudly to his man-size cage, whose front hinges down for ingress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor of the cage is a steel plate. A "writting board" for signing confessions is attached to the inside of the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOTTY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Tomkins self-locking Confessional is cheap at the price and will last for years with just an occasional wipe with a damp cloth... When the villain steps on the floor plate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOTTY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod, dropping books and papers around his feet, is feverishly writing on a blank page (his "traveling inkpot" is hung around his neck).
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the Spotty Man)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arrest that man!

<SPOTTY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the devil are you talking about, you loon?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOTTY_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod takes two steps toward him and gives him a violent shove in the chest. The Spotty Man staggers back into his cage, which self- locks, and at the same time a head clamp descends from the top, gripping the Spotty Man's head. His arms flail about as he yells. Ichabod slaps his page on the writing board, offers his pen.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sign here!

	Not till you confess...!

Uproar around him, Ichabod waits as the prisoner signs the paper, then pulls the "release handle."
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>

The High Constable bangs a gavel until he gets some silence for the Burgomaster. Meanwhile, the Spotty Man is rescued by his friends.
</DIRECTION>
<BURGOMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Constable, this is a song we have heard from you more than once but never before with this discordant accompaniment. I have two courses open to me. First, I can let you cool your heels in the cells until you learn respect for the dignity of my office...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGOMASTER>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg pardon. I only meant well. Why am I the only one who sees that to solve crimes, to detect the guilty, we must use our brains? -- to recognize vital clues, using up-to- date scientific --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<BURGOMASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which brings me to the second course. Constable Crane, there is a town upstate, two days' journey to the north in the Hudson Highlands. It is a place called Sleepy Hollow. Have you heard of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGOMASTER>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<BURGOMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An isolated farming community, mostly Dutch. Three persons have been murdered there, all within a fortnight...each found with their head lopped off.

</BURGOMASTER>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lopped off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<BURGOMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clean as dandelion heads, apparently. Now, these ideas of yours, they have never been put to the test...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGOMASTER>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have never been allowed to put them to the test!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<BURGOMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just so, granted. So you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and deduce, er detect the murderer. Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURGOMASTER>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing doubt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall, gladly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<BURGOMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And remember -- it is you, Ichabod Crane, who is now put to the test.

The Burgomaster smiles encouragingly.

INT/EXT. ICHABOD'S HOME, 2ND FLOOR - DAY (TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Piles of BOOKS and PAPERS, JARS of CHEMICALS, MAGNIFYING GLASSES, CHALKBOARDS covered with scrawl and ANATOMY CHARTS above a small bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE WINDOW, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL inside. He opens the cage and the bird flies free...
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such a day for such a sad farewell, this is good-bye, my sweet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod watches it go, sad, then looks down. A COACH halts in the street below. The forlorn DRIVER looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S COACH leaves city limits, forgoing civilization...following a dirt road to forested wilderness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK FORESTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coach lanterns light the way as the coach lumbers along, caressed by tight foliage. A WOLF is HEARD HOWLING. Ichabod looks out, unnerved, shuts the window's curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPSTATE FORESTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach moves through sun dappled forest...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ICHABOD'S COACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod checks the contents of a LEATHER SATCHEL in his lap. He pauses a moment, studying the palm of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod touches the strange SCARS on both his palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of tissue. Many scars. After a moment, he returns to looking through his satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod stands between two massive STONE PILLARS. He's unsure, turning to watch his coach leave him behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod picks up his bags and heads between the pillars, starting up a LONG STRAIGHT ROAD. He does not notice, in the tree limbs above: THREE DEAD RAVENS, hung by twine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod walks on, passing a CHURCH and GRAVEYARD. The road ahead is bordered by rows of businesses and two-story homes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod enters the TOWN SQUARE proper. And ELDERLY WOMAN stands in a doorway, watching Ichabod. Ichabod tips his hat. The woman backs away, shuts her door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod continues. He looks up...a MAN closes the shutters of a second-story window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ichabod continues he sees that there are two or three Riflemen placed at vantage points on the roofs and also, when he looks back, a Rifleman up on the Church Tower. The whole village is like a Western town waiting for an attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODEN BUNKER - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange WOODEN BUNKER, like a small fortress with a HUGE BELL mounted on top, sits in a field. SEVERAL DIRT FARMERS are gathered, all with rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod stops as he walks, looking at this...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A boy, YOUNG MASBATH, aged 10, comes to the Designated Rifleman, JONATHAN MASBATH, with food and drink, i.e., a picnic tied up in cloth and a stone bottle of beer. Masbath Senior takes the picnic and gives Young Masbath an affectionate pat. He smiles confidently.
</DIRECTION>
<MASBATH_SENIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASBATH_SENIOR>
<DIRECTION>
One farmer comes to lead Young Masbath away as Jonathan heads into the BUNKER, taking several rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the BUNKER, across a field, other dirt farmers light TORCH POSTS in a line along the forest edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod ponders this as he trudges along...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead on a hill: the grand Van Tassel MANOR HOUSE, windows aglow.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod puts down his bags (a suitcase and a leather box-bag) but keeps his satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK-O'-LANTERNS glow on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KISSING COUPLE are lustfully busy in a dark corner of the porch. The woman is a pretty servant, SARAH. The man we will know as DOCTOR LANCASTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod almost blunders into them, causing a little panic and embarrassment, in which Ichabod shares, and as he mumbles apologies and opens the door, a shaft of light identifies the couple for our further reference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The open door reveals the MAIN HALL and FOYER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a harvest party in progress. PEOPLE are gathered. QUIET MUSIC is HEARD from elsewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod opens a door. MEN and WOMEN eat and drink, talking quietly in groups. Ichabod looks around, daunted, tentatively makes his way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod bumps into a few people, excusing himself. He mops his sweaty brow, finds a pretty girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon my intrusion, I seek Baltus Van Tassel but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the parlor, sir, further on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod thanks her, continues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, CHILDREN, YOUNG MEN and LADIES in a circle taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN spun around by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN BRUNT. Brom releases the woman. Everyone quiets, avoiding her searching hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Blindfolded Woman circles slowly, chanting a REFRAIN that makes the CHILDREN and even some of the younger WOMEN shiver with pleasurable fright. They giggle nervously and hush each other up.
</DIRECTION>
<BLINDFOLDED_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch, who's got a kiss for the pickety witch?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLINDFOLDED_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a lunge, grabbing empty air, just missing BROM; everyone moans humorously. Doctor Lancaster slips back into the party, and Sarah likewise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod is trying to pass through to reach the farther door...and on the NEXT REFRAIN finds himself caught by the Blindfolded Woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stays quiet, that's the game, but of course everyone is also puzzled, not knowing Ichabod. The Woman touches Ichabod's face, which embarrasses Ichabod and displeases Brom.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A kiss, a kiss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILD>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has to guess first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN is wifely, and as she puts her arm through Doctor Lancaster's arm, we realize she is his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<BLINDFOLDED_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it Theodore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLINDFOLDED_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a general laugh at that.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon, ma'am. I am only a stranger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<BLINDFOLDED_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then have a kiss on account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLINDFOLDED_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him laughingly and takes the blindfold off the reveal a stunning beauty: KATRINA VAN TASSEL. She smiles. Ichabod tries to compose himself, stricken by the sight of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...um, I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<BROM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you, friend? We have not heard your name yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROM>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have not said it. Excuse me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Brom grabs Ichabod's collar. Ichabod's baffled.
</DIRECTION>
<BROM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need some manners.

(O.S.) (admonishing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, come -- we want no raised voices...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We now SEE that the voice belongs to BALTUS VAN TASSEL, a working- class self-made Mr. Big with a sympathetic smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is only to raise the spirits during this dark time that I and my good wife are giving this little party...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
LADY VAN TASSEL stands behind him, a mix of homespun wife and well- kept lady. Brom releases Ichabod. Children hide behind Katrina. Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point. Others from the party gather.
</DIRECTION>
<BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young sir, you are welcome even if you are selling something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
The pleasantry relaxes the atmosphere around Ichabod.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir. I am Constable Ichabod Crane, sent to you from New York with authority to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
This has quite an effect. A man we will know as MAGISTRATE PHILIPSE looks up sharply. A man we will know as REVEREND STEENWYCK grunts skeptically. A man we have already seen, DOCTOR LANCASTER, exchanges a surprised look with another man, NOTARY HARDENBROOK.
</DIRECTION>
<STEENWYCK>
<DIRECTION>
(rudely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what use is a Constable?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEENWYCK>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel gives the Clergyman a reproachful look.
</DIRECTION>
<LADY_VAN_TASSEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you, Constable Crane -- I hope you will honor this house by remaining with us until...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_VAN_TASSEL>
<BROM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until you've made the arrest!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROM>
<DIRECTION>
To Ichabod's surprise this gets a nervous laugh. Baltus frowns at Brom. Katrina looks at Ichabod with renewed interest.
</DIRECTION>
<BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to his wife)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well spoke!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ichabod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, sir. We'll get you settled.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Musicians)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
Baltus catches the eyes of Philipse, then of Lancaster, nodding as if to say "See you in a minute."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he leads Ichabod out, he murmurs to Steenwyck, who nods and passes the murmur to Hardenbrook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fiddlers strike up the music. Katrina watches Ichabod's exit. Brom watches Katrina's interest with displeasure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the music from downstairs. Ichabod is unpacking -- arranging his scientific books. His "medical case," revealing a few mysterious Instruments of Detections, is open on the bed. Sarah is just delivering a pitcher of water to the washstand.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Please tell Mr. Van Tassel I will be down in a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, sir.

<DIRECTION>
(then -- as she leaves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God you are here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod is a bit surprised by her emotion. Then he pours the water and douses his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIVE MEN wait grimly for Ichabod, silent in the presence of Sarah, who is placing a pipe cradle by Baltus. Lady Van Tassel is pouring the men a drink. The music from the party is faintly audible. Lancaster is 50, dour, always sweaty. Philipse is youngest, a drinker, eyes bloodshot, augmenting his glass with a shot from his private flask. Reverend Steenwyck has a disdainful, sour expression. Hardenbrook is oldest, ancient, nervous, one eye pale and blind.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDENBROOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the way from New York!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, gentlemen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah, leaving, passes Doctor Lancaster, who secretly trails his hand against Sarah's buttock...not quite secretly enough for the vigilance of Lady Van Tassel, who, by the merest flick of an eye, shows us that she has noticed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The Horseman glances back, bounding through, drawing his sword, when suddenly he halts...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's happened upon TWO YOUNG GIRLS gathering firewood. The girls stand frozen at the sight of him for a long, silent moment, till one girl drops the firewood and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second girl remains, holding the Horseman's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman and the girl hold each other's gaze for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman puts his finger to his lips, warning her to stay quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl takes one of her pieces of dry wood and deliberately breaks it, making a noise like a pistol shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a responding shout from a soldier back in the trees. The Horseman turns to the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers move forward from the forest behind, spreading out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second girl flees. The Horseman hefts his sword, turning as soldiers surround. One soldier aims his rifle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman reaches over his shoulder, grasps a sheathed knife and THROWS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOCK! The rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second soldier aims and FIRES... Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm. His sword drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman readies and AXE in his good hand. The Revolutionaries move in with swords. They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL. The Horseman fends off blows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldier Three stabs his blade deep into the Horseman's side. The Horseman roars, bringing his axe DOWN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BREAKS the sword at the hilt. An UPWARD stroke sends Soldier Three backward in a fountain of blood.

The Horseman staggers, trying to pull the blade from his ribs. The remaining soldiers close in...

Daredevil appears, limping, from the trees, and puts his nose down to the turned earth.

This ambiguous statement, accompanied by a faint smile, confuses Ichabod into silence as she closes the door behind her. He turns with relief to the next business -- the Bible. He opens the front cover. On the endpaper is a Family Tree going back a hundred years, in variously faded inks and handwritings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod studies it and we see what he learns: that Katrina was born in 1777...to Baltus's first wife, who died in 1797...that Lady Van Tassel is Baltus's second wife (her maiden name is unimportant, because false)... Then he suddenly notices something even more interesting: The family tree has a "Van Garrett" in it -- the husband of Baltus's father's sister.

Jonathan watches the forest. A horrible, SILENT stillness has fallen. Then, Jonathan's eyes widen...

A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

<DIRECTION>
Jonathan pushes through thorny bushes. Jagged branches bloody his hands and cheeks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bursts from the brier patch and TUMBLES to a TRAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE FOREST BEHIND: The hooves of the black horse rip underbrush. HOOFBEATS DEAFENING. A spur digs into the snorting steed's already bleeding flank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TRAIL, Jonathan runs onward. The shrill WHISTLE of a SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer BLURS PAST...

Jonathan is still running when his head lolls back, at an impossible angle...his head tumbles off his shoulders...

Jonathan's headless body hits the dirt.

<DIRECTION>
Ichabod hasn't quite arrived. The others are watching as Doctor Lancaster turns over the headless corpse of Masbath. He straightens the body reverently. Everyone is shocked and spooked, looking fearfully around. Behind them -- a sound. Everyone reacts but it's Ichabod arriving.

	A fine looking animal, Crane.

Ichabod dismounts, ignoring Brom. The great Detective is trying to cover up his jitters. New York was never like this.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_LANCASTER>

	The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taken!

</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Doctor Lancaster seems unprofessionally jittery. He grasps Philipse by the arm. Philipse shakes him off and pulls out a flask. Ichabod notices this. Their behavior seems to him to be an odd moment. Then he turns his attention back to the matter at hand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But we know this is Jonathan Masbath...

<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly! So, why was the head removed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>

They all wait for enlightenment.

<BALTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
They all watch Ichabod to see what he will do. Philipse takes nips from his flask. But Ichabod isn't sure. He isn't too keen on looking at the corpse. Then he realizes:
</DIRECTION>

	Because!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Despite themselves, they are impressed. Ichabod takes heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod finds a huge, deep HOOFPRINT. He kneels, pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a BOWL, BOTTLE of WATER and a BAG of POWDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others watch, finding this bizarre, as Ichabod begins mixing the water and powder, making plaster.
</DIRECTION>
<BROM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ICHABOD>

Ichabod fills the print with runny plaster.
</DIRECTION>
<BROM>
<DIRECTION>
(grudging the point)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROM>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod shoulders his satchel, walks all around, studies the ground, kicks away leaves...and then lopes around puzzlingly. The watchers are astonished by his antics as he leaps from hoofprint to hoofprint.
</DIRECTION>

Doctor Lancaster impatiently hushes him and turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ichabod stops, turns, following back to way he came...

</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Van Ripper, show me where the neck rested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Van Ripper points. Ichabod opens his satchel, takes out a BOTTLE OF GREEN POWDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uncorks the bottle, sprinkles a thin layer of powder on the dirt, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A reaction causes the powder to bubble a little.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A chemical reaction, it shows there was just a smear of blood, no more.

	I didn't see none.

</VAN_RIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod swallows, queasy, trying not to let it show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod takes odd spectacles from his satchel, wire-framed with many lenses: MAGNIFICATION SPECTACLES. He fumbles putting them on, examines the gross neck wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod takes an INSTRUMENT from his satchel, a delicate SCISSOR MECHANISM TOOL that tapes off into tiny jaws. He uses it, hand shaking, to pick at the flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV through Ichabod's magnifying spectacles: a CREEPY CRAWLY BUG is feeding on the wound. Ichabod freaks, leaps up.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering, faking)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting...

</ICHABOD>
<BALTUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? -- What is it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTUS>
<DIRECTION>
Squinting sidelong at the ground, Ichabod uses his foot to squash and grind the bug, which is too small to be visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Baltus, his eyes huge in his spectacles.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wound was cauterized in the very instant...as though the blade itself were red hot...and yet, no blistering, no scorched flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>

They all look worried.

People WHISPER and steal glances at Ichabod. Ichabod stands with Baltus and Lady Van Tassel. Ichabod looks around, observing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath stands with his head bowed.

Brom stands beside Katrina, who wipes tears. Brom puts his arm around Katrina, comforting. Theodore and Glenn are nearby with rifles over their shoulders.

Philipse sees that Steenwyck has noticed the encounter. He breaks off and scuttles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod turns his gaze toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fresh grave of Jonathan Masbath, and three more graves almost as recent: The Van Garretts are just receiving their brand new headstones, and Widow Winship's grave is marked for the present by a simple wooden cross with her name on it.

Ichabod sees Killian and nods to him.

Ichabod lifts the lid of a large feed bin half full of horse feed. Young Masbath is curled up inside like a mouse in a nest. Homeless.

	Find a place in the Van Tassel's servant quarters. Wake me before dawn. I hope you have a strong stomach.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT/DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lid of a muddy coffin is wrenched open. The coffin contains a headless corpse. Just the one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What's happening?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffin is on the ground next to the hole marked by the headstone of Peter Van Garrett.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Killian holds a lantern and a spade. Ichabod, holding a handkerchief to his face, looks into the open coffin. He nods. Ichabod, in shirtsleeves and sweating, has a spade too. Young Masbath is watching uneasily. This is why Young Masbath would need a "strong stomach." He gags, almost pukes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At Ichabod's nod, Killian replaces the lid. Killian has Two Men with him. There are two more coffins and two more piles of dirt, one coffin for Dirk Van Garrett and one for Widow Winship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod moves to the second coffin. It contains a headless corpse. Just the one. Ichabod nods, and the lid is replaced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third coffin -- the Widow's -- is being opened by one of the Men. Ichabod takes a lantern and looks expectantly as the lid comes off. The Widow's headless corpse is alone in the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod pauses. Nods. As the lid is about to be replaced. He stops it.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod takes out a small penknife and cuts through the shroud. He reveals the belly. He stares at it. Was she pregnant? It's impossible to tell. But there is the wound of a sword stab in the stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a screech, which seems to come from the corpse, giving heart attacks all around -- but now we see a "ghost" holding a lantern. It's Reverend Steenwyck who has discovered them and is shrieking in outrage.
</DIRECTION>
<STEENWYCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sacrilege! Sacrilege!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEENWYCK>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod recovers.

	Science...science, Reverend Steenwyck! Someone in Sleepy Hollow is using the Horseman story for his own murderous purpose, and I intend to...dig it out.

Steenwyck froths, looks terrified and backs off.

INT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM - DAY

Ichabod and Killian, helped by Young Masbath, carry the Widow's muddy coffin inside. Doctor Lancaster watches in horror, sweating profusely, freaked out.

	Once more, the neck wound cauterized. The sword thrust to the stomach, the same, perhaps by chemical means. But to what purpose?

<DIRECTION>
Ichabod gingerly feels the corpse's stomach. The Doctor watches. We get the feeling he "knows something."
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_LANCASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To what is your purpose, is the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_LANCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod takes a rolled VELVET CLOTH from his satchel, unrolls it...it holds SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, some particularly strange: RIB-SPEADERS and CURVED CLAMPS.

<ICHABOD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Step outside. Thank you for your help, Mr. Killian. And, if you do not mind, Doctor, my concentration suffers when I am observed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod watches Killian, Young Masbath and Lancaster go. He quickly returns to his satchel, pulling out a BOOK: HUMAN ANATOMY. He searches the pages...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips through DRAWINGS of ANATOMY, then sets the book open nearby so he can refer to it. He picks up a KNIFE, stands at the corpse, taking a deep uncertain breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod cuts into the Widow's belly, but stops, looking horrified at what he's done. He leans close to study the book again, worried. He makes another incision... He looks down at it, queasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath sits waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doctor Lancaster stands with Philipse (hung over), Steenwyck and Hardenbrook, speaking agitatedly. OTHER PEOPLE have gathered in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the doctor's residence opens and Ichabod steps out. He is bloodied, shaken, futilely wiping at the mess with a blood-covered cloth, looking up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All attention goes to Ichabod. Everyone's horrified.

</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>

The small crowd murmurs, shocked. Doctor Lancaster recovers, furious.

<DOCTOR_LANCASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What of it? She should have been left to make her peace with God and not cut to bits by the Constabulary!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_LANCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod is shaken for a moment, remembering the similar charge made against him in New York.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sword was thrust into the womb and no farther. A symbolic murder. We are dealing with a madman.

EXT. LONG STRAIGHT ROAD, COVERED BRIDGE - LATER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pale moonlight. Ichabod rides Gunpowder across the COVERED BRIDGE. They are an ungainly pair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following the road, Ichabod is lost in thought. The CLOPPING of HOOFBEATS is HEARD on the bridge behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod turns to look. HOOFBEATS STOP. No one can be seen in the dark mouth of the bridge. CRICKETS CHIRP.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod faces forward, continuing to the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hums a tune to himself, tone deaf. After a moment, a HORSE is HEARD SNORTING, HOOFBEATS RESUME. Ichabod stops Gunpowder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is SOMEONE back there, on horseback, coming out from the darkness of the bridge, slowly...
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
The FIGURE comes into moonlight, on a BLACK HORSE, smoke seeming to rise from him; a dark FIGURE, cloaked -- headless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod panics, kicking Gunpowder to flee. The figure takes off to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod whips Gunpowder's reins, gasping, moving faster. The figure behind also picks up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gunpowder carries Ichabod into the forest. The headless figure is right behind, cloak flowing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HEADLESS FIGURE is HEARD letting out a hellish CRY of rage. Ichabod glances fearfully over his shoulder...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HORRIBLE FACE with flaming eyes and mouth rushes forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It SMASHES into Ichabod -- sends him sprawling to the ground in an explosion of red hot ash and cinders...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod rolls, shaken...looking behind. The trail is empty. HOOFBEATS are HEARD. SEVERAL HORSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod stands. He looks down at the remnants of a BROKEN JACK-O'- LANTERN and smoldering ball of paper on the trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIGURE rides to a halt, throws off a cloak and "headless" disguise; it's Brom. Glenn and Theodore ride up, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom also laughs, but when he looks back, the smile leaves his face. He takes grim satisfaction in what he's done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's face is haunted, running with the sweat of fear -- he is still trembling from the experience.

A woman is in the doorway, holding out her arms. She seems to be Katrina as Ichabod first saw her, blindfolded.

<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG BOY, aged about seven, runs toward her, with a little bunch of wildflowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - YOUNG ICHABOD'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Blindfolded Woman is playing the Pickety Witch Game with Ichabod. He is laughing -- scared as she grabs the air looking for him. He is holding the wildflowers he picked. She seizes him, kisses him and takes off the blindfold. It's not Katrina, but his Mother, a kind and lovely face. He gives his Mother the flowers. She puts one of the flowers in her hair, laughing. But the others -- she throws on the fire! -- and she crouches at the hearthstone, beckoning him, still "nice." He comes to her, not scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the flowers burn, they give off smoky fumes, which the Mother inhales like perfume, closing her eyes in a trance. He watches fascinated as she picks up a twig and starts drawing pictures -- strange designs -- in the layer of ash on the hearthstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Ichabod turns his head to the door, which is opening -- spooky because no one is entering. Then he sees at floor level the family CAT has come through the door. A black cat with a white paw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's Mother is "awakened" by this, just in time as Father, a grim Parson all in black, enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod looks up frightened at the face of his Father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ichabod is tucked up in bed, astonished and happy. The Bird and Cage blur together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning flashes outside a window, thunder booms, the storm bursts open the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cat leaps off the bed, caught in lightning flash, the Toy drops, tangled on the bed. Ichabod covers his face, scared; his Mother hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod is startled awake, frightened, sweating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod enters with a lantern and his Ledger. He sits, studies notes, then notices a light down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod enters. Opposite an elaborate LOOM, Katrina reads by candlelight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up, and self-consciously closes her book, which we see is a child's version of THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE. She covers it on her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...pardon my intrusion...I saw a light...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is no intrusion...I come here to read when I am wakeful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To read books which you must hide...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were my mother's books...my father frowned at them then, and would frown at me now. He believes tales of romance caused the brain fever that killed my mother. She died two years ago come midwinter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw it written in the front of the Bible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The nurse who cared for her during her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was something else too. Why did no one think to mention that Van Garretts are kith and kin to the Van Tassels?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, because there is hardly a household in Sleepy Hollow that is not connected to every other by blood or marriage. I have more cousins than fingers and toes to count them on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
A cock crows. Ichabod goes to the window to look at the edge of dawn.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This land was Van Garrett Land, given to my father when I was in swaddling clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Given by the dead Van Garrett?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Van Garretts were the richest family round these parts even then. When my father brought us to Sleepy Hollow, Van Garrett set him up with an acre and a broken-down cottage, and a dozen of Van Garrett hens. My father prospered, and built us a new house. I owe my happiness to him. I remember living poor in the cottage. Should I show you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I would like to see where you were as poor as I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina stands up, revealing a Book that had been on the floor, hidden by her skirt. She picks up the book and gives it to Ichabod.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this. It is my gift for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod looks at the title page: A COMPENDIUM OF SPELLS, CHARMS AND DEVICES OF THE SPIRIT WORLD.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(troubled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have no use for...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you so certain of everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod sees that Katrina's name is written on the endpaper, and, in a different hand, her mother's name, "Elizabeth Van Tassel."
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was your mother's...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it close to your heart. It is sure protection against harm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you so certain of everything?

<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet and hold for a moment. Ichabod accepts the book by placing it on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELDS - DAY (EARLY MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod and Katrina make a pretty picture on horseback, riding slowly toward the cottage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND - DAY (EARLY MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod and Katrina, riding, come upon the ruin of a cottage. There is almost nothing left but the hearth and a part of a chimney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod dismounts and helps Katrina down from her horse, taking her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he lets go, she notices the little scars on his palm. She takes both his hands and looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are strange... What are they...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I knew. I had them since I can remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina holds his hands a moment longer, their eyes meet, then she lets go and "enters" the ruin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's attention is caught by a red Cardinal on a branch, like the bird he had in New York.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reflects a moment, then turns to watch Katrina crouching by the hearth. She has put a flower in her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to play by this hearth. It was my first drawing school and my mother was my teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Unwittingly, Katrina is mimicking Ichabod's dream. She picks up a twig and starts "drawing" on the hearth stone. Like Ichabod's mother in his dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's blood runs cold but she is unaware of him. Then he notices that a few small wildflowers are growing in the old fireplace. Ichabod feels short of breath, he leans against the stones for support.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look! I'd forgotten this! -- see -- carved into the fire-back, the Archer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Using her fingers she cleans off the dirt around a simple carving of a man with a Bow and Arrow.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was from long before we lived here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to show Ichabod and notices him looking strange.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod nods, recovering, saying nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina is reassured. Suddenly her attention is caught, as Ichabod's was, by the Cardinal bird.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look! A Cardinal! My favorite! I would love to have a tame one, but I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod unslings his satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I have something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
He has a PAPER DISK with a BIRD on one side and an EMPTY CAGE on the other, pierced by a looped string on which the disk can twist and spin. He demonstrates like a magician. This is the very Toy given to him by his Mother.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Cardinal on one side, and an empty cage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina watches intently. Ichabod spins the Disk.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
The bird appears to be inside the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina is astonished and delighted.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do magic! Teach me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is no magic. It is optics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod gives her the Toy and shows her how to spin it.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Separate pictures which become one picture in the spinning... Like the truth which I must spin here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina spins the disk, the bird appears in the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHILIPSE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOVING POV is checking out the Village House. Through lighted windows, figures of Men are seen pacing, apparently arguing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Philipse is packing his bags, moving out...while three Men, Steenwyck, Doctor Lancaster and Hardenbrook, are in agitated conference. Their raised voices make an undecipherable hubbub. The POV'S horse makes a horsey snuffling sound. Is it Daredevil?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steenwyck comes right to the window as if he has seen something...but he merely closes the shutters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The REVERSE shows that it is Ichabod who has been spying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod backs off and mounts Gunpowder, looking thoughtful, then determined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE VILLAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Mounted Man is approaching on a heavily loaded Pack Horse...Philipse making his getaway from Sleepy Hollow. As he reaches the foreground, Ichabod on Gunpowder intercepts him, grabbing the bridle of the Pack Horse.
</DIRECTION>
<PHILIPSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Let go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>

</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>

	You'll raise the village.

Philipse calms down.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a mind to help me.

	Yes -- and I put myself in mortal dread of...

</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>

	Powers against which there is no defense.

<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know the widow was expecting a child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<PHILIPSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I deduce you are the father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<PHILIPSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope your deductions serve you better in your contest against the Hessian. I am not the father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she tell you the name of the child's father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<PHILIPSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- she did. She came to me for advice -- as the town magistrate --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod hears sounds...of sheep in agitation at some distance but he holds Philipse to his story.
</DIRECTION>
<PHILIPSE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- to protect the rights of her child. I was bound by my oath of office to keep the secret --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe the father killed her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<PHILIPSE>
<DIRECTION>
(stares at him in surprise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Horseman killed her! -- You damn fool, do you suppose the Horseman stops to impregnate our women?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Horseman? How often do I have to tell you there is no Horseman! There never was a Horseman! -- and there never will be a Horseman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod grabs him fiercely, pulling on the amulet Philipse wears around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<PHILIPSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go! -- it is my talisman that protects me from the Horseman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a magistrate! -- and your head full of such nonsense! Now tell me the name of --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
A flock of sheep comes streaming and bleating across the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horses go crazy, BRAYING and rearing. A SOUND is HEARD, distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS. Wind kicks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Philipse looks to the forest. A FLOCK of BIRDS alights.
</DIRECTION>
<PHILIPSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my...oh my oh my oh my...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIPSE>
<DIRECTION>
PHILIPSE runs away. HOOFBEATS LOUDER, CLOSER. Ichabod faces the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forest explodes open, foliage bending to make way as the HEADLESS HORSEMAN gallops into view atop DAREDEVIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's stunned. He looks down to draw his flintlock pistol, but the Horseman ROARS by before he can raise it -- a blast of air knocks Ichabod off his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After this, everything happens very quickly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman chases Philipse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Philipse looks over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman draws his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Philipse gathers his courage and stops, turning. He raises his iron key talisman before him. The Horseman is closing...
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Philipse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless. The Horseman swings his sword upon the talisman -- CLANK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Philipse's severed head spins. His body falls and folds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two pieces of Philipse's Talisman, an Iron Key, fly through the air, toward Ichabod, who has only just managed to find his feet and find his fallen pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman turns Daredevil in a wide circle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daredevil completes the turn, letting out a SCREECHY CRY as the Horseman rides straight toward Ichabod...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Ichabod has time to take aim, the Horseman is upon him and past him! -- heading toward Philipse's corpse...leans effortlessly to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod turns, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod stands, stricken. He faints.
</DIRECTION>

INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ichabod gasps awake. A KNOCKING is HEARD.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Constable Crane...?
	</DIALOGUE>

Ichabod looks at his hand balled into a fist. He opens his hand -- holds BOTH HALVES of PHILIPSE'S IRON KEY TALISMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL 3RD FLOOR - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath is seated by Ichabod's closed door. Katrina is backing up Baltus, who knocks again.

Young Masbath shakes his head.

INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM - DAY

Baltus enters. Katrina and Masbath follow him, cautiously, "visiting the sick." Ichabod sits up in bed, stunned, spaced out.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a Headless Horseman!

<BALTUS>

<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MILLION WHITE MILKWEED SEEDLINGS are floating in sunlight. Young Ichabod's laughter is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see that his Mother is blowing the seedlings for his delight. She gives him a milkweed pod and shows him how to do it for himself. Ichabod breaks the pod and releases another million. But when he looks around to share the delight, his Mother has gone...and he sees her disappearing among the trees. He goes to follow her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - FOREST GLADE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod can't see his Mother anywhere...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sees her standing in the middle of a CIRCLE OF BEAUTIFUL TOADSTOOLS/MUSHROOMS growing in the Glade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod watches as his Mother turns inside the Mushroom Circle, almost dancing. He smiles. Then he sees his Mother stoop to pick a mushroom. She eats it. She looks happy. She drops a small piece of the mushroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod sees it fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs forward and picks it up before she sees him. Ichabod eats it. His Mother sees him, takes his hands in hers and dances around in a circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ichabod whizzes around laughing, his POV becomes the Encircling Trees whizzing around, and suddenly he seems to be surrounded by Menacing Headless Figures dressed all in black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod falls over dizzy and when he looks up he sees that the Headless Figures have become his Father, watching his Mother heedlessly dancing, his face like thunder. His Mother has loosened her clothes and is virtually barebreasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Father's eyes begin to glow like live coals as Ichabod cowers away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - ICHABOD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's eyes are spying...through a crack in the kitchen door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When we see him properly, he is wearing a nightshirt. Then we see his POV, into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - YOUNG ICHABOD'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother is seated, her head down. Father paces, chastising Mother angrily, his fist balled up in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father continues berating Mother. He picks up his Bible off the table, waving it, then grabs Mother by the shoulders, forcing her to the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father forces Mother to her knees. Mother is afraid, clasping her hands in front of her as Father forces her to pray. Father starts reading from the Bible. In Ichabod's dream, this is the same Bible from Baltus's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - YOUNG ICHABOD'S STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod watches, afraid. He backs away, returning upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A window is thrown CRASHING open, THUNDER BOOMING... Young Ichabod sits up in his bed. He goes to close the window, RAIN pouring in. He looks down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S DREAM - EXT. YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, in front of the home, a MAN drags Mother toward a COACH. TWO MEN stand watching, faces hidden under hat brims. Mother looks back, eyes pleading, struggling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother looks up to Young Ichabod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO MEN looks up to Young Ichabod: one is Father, and the THIRD MAN is a Cotton Mather-ish man with a villainous face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Ichabod reaches helplessly toward Mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother is forced into the coach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Third Man speaks to Father, then walks to the coach. He gets onto the coach as the coach starts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father watches, rain flowing down his stony features. LIGHTING FLASHES... And we see the family Cat watching with glowing eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's eyes as he opens them. He wakes, breathing heavily.

The Crone shakes one jar, pulls the lid off and upends it. A BABY BAT squirms, dazed. The Crone grips the bat, uses a knife to cut off its head, soaks the straw with blood.

Ichabod cries out, leaping backward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAINS on the restraining CUFFS around the creature's hands go taut, yanking the creature back.
</DIRECTION>

Ichabod KNOCKS over a table of bones, hits the floor. The creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod. It SHRIEKS.

INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod moves through UNDERBRUSH, keeping low. A HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.

Ichabod forges on, pushes through branches, fearful...

He comes up behind a FIGURE IN A GRAY CLOAK on horseback, raising his pistol, cocking the hammer...

EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a clearing, slowing their horses...looking up in wonder at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its branches reach far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.

<DIRECTION>
Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will not grow. Young Masbath and Katrina dismount behind. They all walk toward the tree...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, like a terrible suture, now healed and scarred. Ichabod approaches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till sap begins to run. Red Sap. Ichabod fingers it, sniffs it.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blood.

</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here.

</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the suture. It sounds hollow. He begins to CHOP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He CHOPS into the suture...pulls away loose bark. The tree drips more blood and a goo. Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the festering suture.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>

	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just...keep where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath moves closer. Ichabod keeps CHOPPING, then grips a large, loose flap, trying to pull it away. It's not easy. Ichabod struggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina follows Young Masbath's slow advance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's pulling -- the flap suddenly gives, revealing a blood- soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod recoils. Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod backs off, back of his hand to his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is PHILIPSE'S HEAD, hanging off the trunk flap, held by roots grown around and into the flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots within the dewy innards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the heads is Jonathan Masbath's. Before Young Masbath sees it, Katrina hides his face in her bosom and comforts him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God...

	This is...a gateway, between two worlds...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod studies the ground, circling the trunk... Around the other side, Ichabod gets to his knees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's found the HORSEMAN'S SWORD: the grave marker, jutting out from the ground, rusted twenty years' worth, gripped by the tree trunk and vines.

Ichabod drops the burlap, looking down, disbelieving...

	It means, my dear Miss Van Tassel, it means -- yes! What exactly does it mean? -- It means, unless I am mistaken...it definitely means something -- what that something is, only time will tell! But I sense that we are very close to the answer here, if only we had one more clue...

Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because...the ROOTS in the grave are ALIVE, entwining around remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inward...sucking Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod bounds over the grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and Young Masbath along as he flees across the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the tree, the suture swells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUMBLING is HEARD from the tree. It's wound suddenly BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.

Embers swirl everywhere. Ichabod dismounts, moving closer to the cave ...suddenly he SLIPS...

Ichabod falls down a bloody rock, landing very close to the CRONE'S HEADLESS BODY. Ichabod recoils, crawling away, looking to the carnage in terror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corpse lies near the cave entrance. The jagged skin of the neck wound still bleeds. The ground and dead leaves around the corpse are thick with BLOOD. Ichabod crawls back to the Crone, terrified...because he has seen a CLUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cord around the Crone's neck has been cut and the Carved Bauble is missing (along with the Crone's head).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod hears a Horse neighing in the trees...and the sound of the horse crashing through the undergrowth, departing...but he can see nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom, Theodore and Glen are on patrol -- Brom with his new rifle. They can hear the same horse crashing invisibly through branches, the sound of hooves. They can't tell where the sound is coming from. They look around nervously.

When they clear the frame there is a sound of deep rumbling, the sound we heard before Jonathan Masbath was murdered.

INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small home. Killian, Thomas and BETH, Killian's wife, have finished supper. Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same rumbling sound is faintly heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glasses on the table shiver audibly. Killian notices. Then the phenomenon stops. Killian continues picking his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas gets down from his chair. He goes to the fireplace to light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with SILHOUETTES of LIONS and MONSTERS.
</DIRECTION>

Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures' SHADOWS are cast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He roars for them, imagining them real and having a grand time.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER is HEARD. The horse stops...it is Brom's horse, with Brom riding. Brom looks skyward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All around, the WIND HALTS. A DEAD SILENCE falls. Distant HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom takes his long rifle from his shoulder, rides...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Behind Killian, MANTELPIECE STONES pulse, breathing. Demonic faces form, then disappear. WIND HOWLS.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him. Beth enters, looking at Thomas, smiling.

The magic lantern suddenly stops spinning. Shadow creatures freeze. Beth looks up, noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND. The smile leaves her face.
</DIRECTION>

INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a ROAR, the fire flares. Killian looks... In the leaping flames he seems to see -- as we also seem to see -- the ILLUSION OF DEMONIC FACES molded out of flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARD. The Horseman steps in, a battle axe in each hand. WIND BLASTS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR to the other room SLAMS. Killian grabs a chair and HURLS it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman swings, SMASHING it aside.

Killian grabs an IRON SKEWER from the fireplace, SWINGS it to fend off a blow from the Horseman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman SWINGS the other axe. Killian ducks. The axe CRACKS fireplace stone, throwing sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Killian lunges, JAMMING the skewer into the Horseman... The skewer comes through the Horseman's back. The Horseman SWIPES with the flat of one axe -- POUNDS Killian aside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Killian hits the wall, BASHING his head. Hits the floor.
</DIRECTION>

Brom, on his horse, hears Beth's shriek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF. Her BODY is HEARD HITTING the floor above. Thomas sees the shadow of Beth's head rolling across the gaps in the floorboards above him, coming to rest with her hair showing, hanging down in the gap. FOOTSTEPS are HEARD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM - NIGHT

The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a sack, cinching the sack shut.
</DIRECTION>

The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle axe he left. He stands. Long, silent pause.

Thomas cowers, trembling. QUIET.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KILLIAN'S HOME, CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hole appears as debris falls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas looks up. He tries to crawl away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman's arm SHOVES through from above -- grabbing Thomas and YANKING him up through the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KILLIAN'S FARM, TOWN OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom rides from the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, at Killian's house, among scattered homes on the outskirts of town, Daredevil rides up as the Headless Horseman walks out with his sack of heads. The Horseman ties the sack to his saddle and leaps up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman ignores Brom. But Brom refuses to be ignored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom puts his reins in his mouth, aims his rifle...FIRING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM -- the slug blows the Horseman off Daredevil, EXPLODING. Daredevil keeps going. The Horseman's smoldering body is left "face down."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom halts his horse. He climbs down, pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman rises to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading. He fills the gun from his powder horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns. The blast has exposed rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom readies his ramrod, but there's no time. He rises, hefting his rifle, straight at the Horseman with a yell...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman is on him. Brom swings the rifle, blocking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword with the rifle -- CLANK...CLANK...CLANK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder arrive...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing, knocks Brom's rifle away, sends Brom to the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman walks away from Brom. Ichabod sees this, registers it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom pulls a knife and throws it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife blade goes through the Horseman from back to front, like a spear thrust through a smoldering sack of rotten flesh. The Horseman pulls Brom's knife, blade first, from his chest and turns upon Brom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom scrambles up, flees, running toward Killian's. The Horseman THROWS the knife...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman strides to Brom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman changes his sword grip, blade open...plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword to skewer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod arrives at full gallop -- SMASHES the lantern into the Horseman -- KNOCKING the Horseman off Brom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DISTANCE, Theodore and Glen arrive on horseback. They halt where they are, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom runs, limping to Killian's house, a goal in sight: FARM IMPLEMENTS propped there. Brom grabs SCYTHES with long curved blades, one in each hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod leaps off Gunpowder, runs to Brom's side.
</DIRECTION>

Brom shakes himself free and --

FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to reveal putrid innards.

The Horseman turns and strides back -- no more nice guy!

Brom throws the pistol at the Horseman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the way, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns his horse and flees. Glenn follows Theodore away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom steps up, scythes ready. He and the Horseman go at it -- Brom blocks axe and sword, deflecting blows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod grabs a long-handled SICKLE, circles them...SWINGS the sickle. The Horseman blocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman battles both men at once, catching blows...counting every strike, METAL RINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's sickle is knocked out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, catches the axe handle in the other scythe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom, sending him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom picks up Ichabod's sickle and SWINGS it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blade embeds in the Horseman down to the hilt.

Ichabod crawls, shaking off the blow. The Horseman staggers, trying to pull the blade from his body.

Brom yanks Ichabod to his feet and grabs his scythes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they flee, Ichabod grabs a wood-splitting AXE from the stump where it's imbedded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind, the Horseman manages to extract the sickle, drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom and Ichabod head toward the COVERED BRIDGE that leads across to the town square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman strides after...retrives his axe on the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN SQUARE AND COVERED BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom and Ichabod start across. Ichabod must help support Brom as Brom limps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind, the Horseman picks up the pace, closing fast...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the bridge, Ichabod and Brom are halfway across. FOOTSTEPS are HEARD POUNDING. Ichabod glances back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman is not behind them. Ichabod and Brom looks up. The POUNDING FOOTSTEPS are on the roof, passing over...!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, at the mouth of the covered bridge, the Horseman leaps down, spinning in midair, lands, crouched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod and Brom halt. The Horseman rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod releases Brom and moves forward, gripping his wood axe in both hands, SWINGING the axe downward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman swings his axe -- SPLINTERS Ichabod's axe handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman, axe in one hand, sword in the other, turns upon Brom, and in pulling Brom aside out of the path of the sword, Ichabod recieves a sword-thrust in the shoulder, which makes him screem out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman lifts his sword arm, THROWING Ichabod and withdrawing the sword in one motion...Ichabod tumbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brom moves forward with scythes. The Horseman sets upon him with incredible ferocity -- battling Brom back, striking so hard and fast it's hard for Brom to keep blocking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod tries to get up, but falls, looking up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ICHABOD'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman KNOCKS one of Brom's scythes away, takes another SWING -- sends Brom spinning in a spray of blood...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman stands over Brom's body, CHOPPING with his sword. Our POINT OF VIEW grows BLURRY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLURRY HORSEMAN approaches the POV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod is at the Horseman's mercy.

Then, another ANGLE -- the Horseman ignores Ichabod, strides past him. Ichabod takes a step back and collapses.

Empty church. Young Ichabod enters, carries a lantern past pews. He HEARS a SOUND, moving behind a pew to hide.

Ahead, across the church, a RED DOOR opens... Father and the villainous Third Man come out, shutting the door, speaking quietly. The Third man holds a piece of parchment paper. Father is ever emotionless.

<DIRECTION>
Ichabod watches them, ducking down to keep hidden...

Father and the Third Man walk to leave down the aisle, passing close to Ichabod without seeing him. They exit, leaving Young Ichabod alone in the silent church.

Young Ichabod enters. The room contains TORTURE DEVICES: IRON CUFFS, THUMB SCREWS, KNIFES and NEEDLES. There is a SPIKED CHAIR, fitted with sharp spikes, adorned with straps for holding down the "accused."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Ichabod backs away, terrified, then sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shaft of light cuts across a large, sarcophagus-like IRON MAIDEN -- where MOTHER'S EYES can be seen through the slit in the Iron Maiden's face. Open eyes. Dead eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Ichabod lets out a strangled cry, runs to the Iron Maiden, trying to pull it open, clawing at the lock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Young Ichabod backs away, choking on misery. He looks around in despair. He falls to his knees at the spiked chair, places his hands on the spikes, pressing...

As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands. He looks down and sees the CAT is there, looking up at him. The cat reaches up to rub its head against his face.

EXT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath slowly opens the door to peer out. He walks out onto the porch, watching as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE LAWN, a CLOAKED FIGURE walks, carrying a LANTERN. The figure heads onto the long straight road, into the forest, lantern light dissipating.

Young Masbath steps off the porch, in cautious pursuit.

</ICHABOD>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that is where I expect to find deposited...the last will and testament of the elder Van Garrett...

<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have thought of something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...of something you said, Young Masbath... The Widow Winship came many a day with a basket of eggs to Van Garrett...who I understand had hens to spare... I begin to see. It was Van Garrett's child that the widow was carrying. And what news have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard someone leaving last night. Looked like they headed to town, but I lost them in the woods.

Ichabod ponders, troubled, as Masbath brings him a shirt.

<ICHABOD>

	The Horseman does the killing but, I believe, at the bidding of a mortal, someone of flesh and blood.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What...? What makes you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The witch...the crone, when I happened upon her corpse, she lay in a pool of blood. Blood poured hard from her neck. The wound was not cauterized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it seem so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the settling of a private score. But the Horseman cuts heads to a different drum. The crone pointed us to what drives the Hessian -- his skull has been stolen from his grave. The person who stole it has power over the Hessian. Here is why the Headless One has returned through the gate of the Tree of the Dead. He chops heads until his own is restored to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what person...?

</YOUNG_MASBATH>

EXT. TOWN SQUARE, CHURCH - DAY

<DIRECTION>
WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm. A CROWD empties the town's general store. Provisions are passed along, man to man, and loaded onto wheelbarrows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing MANY ANGRY FACES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up windows with lumber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod and Young Masbath stop, tying their horses in front of the "NOTARY." Ichabod looks off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE ROAD, people head to the CHURCH. Much activity...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sanctuary. Or, so they hope.

</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
People carry supplies into the church, within the bordering WROUGHT- IRON FENCE. Others work to build and erect massive WOODEN CROSSES.

In the crowd here, Reverend Steenwyck spots Ichabod and Young Masbath, pushes past people, shouting...

<STEENWYCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is! There...!

	<DIALOGUE>
	The desecrater of Christian burial! Twice he met the Horseman, and kept his head! How is it so...?

</STEENWYCK>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE NOTARY, Ichabod tries to ignore, heads inside, as a clod of earth hits him on the shoulder.

IN THE CHURCHYARD, Steenwyck continues his rant.

INT. NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, untidy room with piles of dusty documents in great disorder. The Notary Hardenbrook looks at Ichabod with his one good eye. Young Masbath stands near.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it, Mr. Hardenbrook, that wills and testaments are held here on public record?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Hardenbrook is in a funk, trying to act calm. He passes a document across the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDENBROOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe this is what you wish to see. Take it and go!

<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next of kin after the son would be the eldest of the line from Van Garrett's father's sister...none other than the Baltus Van Tassel: something else no one thought to mention!

<HARDENBROOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you have found your way to it, and I hope you will leave now before my windows are boken.

The crowd murmurs outside like angry bees. Ichabod flourishes the will.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not ready to leave.

Hardenbrook starts moaning and wringing his hands.

<ICHABOD>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A brick through your window is not what puts you in terror, Hardenbrook ...there is something else... I saw your fear, and Steenwyck's and the doctor's, when you met at Philipse's house... Philipse paid with his head, and you fear for your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<HARDENBROOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's true! -- but we did not know it was a murdering plot when we were drawn in!

	Made who next of kin to whom?! -- I'm confused!

	He means old Van Garrett secretly married the Widow Winship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(getting it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! And Van Garrett made a new will, leaving everything to her and his unborn child... So she stood between Baltus and the legacy! Where is the will?

<HARDENBROOK>

	I cannot be seen to help you -- the Horseman will come for me -- !

Hardenbrook digs into a mountain of documents, hurling handfuls into the air...and flings the second will at Ichabod. Young Masbath nervously checks the door.

Young Masbath takes the document and looks at it tearfully.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>

	But the secret was not safe. Mrs. Killian the midwife was forewarned the baby was coming -- and so she, too, had to die.

One of the other hurled documents has fluttered down fortuitously in front of Ichabod. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The marriage certificate. Parson Steenwyck married them. Doctor Lancaster confirmed the widow was pregnant. She told the secret to Magistrate Philipse. Notary Hardenbrook concealed the documents...

Hardenbrook snivels and moans and wrings his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>

	And you all kept silence! Why?... For some nameless dread of the man who stood to gain by it -- Baltus Van Tassel!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Do give me the benefit of your...

	All these murders...just so that Baltus Van Tassel should inherit yet more land and property?

</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>

	Precisely. Men murder for profit. Possibly you don't know New York...?

Suddenly he sees his bedroom door is ajar.

Ichabod and Young Masbath exchange a glance.

	Well...perhaps.

	Really? Why is that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves the Ledger open on the desk. Ichabod steps over to look. Young Masbath cranes his neck to look. It is a page of doodles with the name "Katrina" written several times, and a sketch of Katrina. Embarrassed Ichabod closes the Ledger.

Ichabod opens the drawer in the desk and puts away the document he took from the Notary.

He is nervous because he knows they point to complicity by Katrina's father. Young Masbath, watching, understands this, Ichabod locks the drawer and pockets the key.

Katrina leaves. Ichabod is troubled.

Then -- to add to his troubles -- he suddenly sees a HUGE SPIDER scuttling under his bed. He doesn't like spiders, even small ones. He gives a yelp.

	It's only a spider.

Young Masbath, fully dressed, sleeps on the bed. Ichabod sits waiting. He takes the cover off the lantern, looks at a CLOCK. Midnight.

Ichabod and Young Masbath cross, A CREAKING FLOORBOARD is HEARD from ANOTHER ROOM. Ichabod quickly covers his lantern.

Across the room, LIGHT comes under a DOOR, stops...continues. FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, then a DOOR OPENING and CLOSING.

LANTERN LIGHT moves, far ahead. Ichabod and Young Masbath follow, fearful, keeping hidden.

Ichabod advances, up the hill...peers forward to see...

EXT. FOREST CLEARING BY VAN TASSEL HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The lantern sits on a rock. On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and semi- naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The couple keeps coupling, the MAN on top. His grunts and gasps are particularly desperate. He's all over the WOMAN, who lays back...it is LADY VAN TASSEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel pulls down the man's shirt, exposes his flesh. She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's eyes widen. He's about to shout a warning, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep into her palm. Blood flows. She rubs her cut hand over her partner's arching back, smearing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...trailing blood. The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucking the woman's bloody fingers ...it's REVEREND STEENWYCK.

Ichabod backs away, having seen more than enough.

<DIRECTION>
He opens the drawer knowing the worst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The documents have been taken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Masbath suddenly sniffs the air. He signals to Ichabod, alert. He shiffs again...and in the grate is the source of the smell: the documents burned to ashes.

Ichabod, in despondency, brings his finger to his head, rubbing his temples.

That's as far as he gets before Steenwyck wrenches a heavy ornate CROSS from the wall and smashes his skull with a blow of tremendous force, with the Cross.

Baltus FIRES -- blasts a bloody hole in Steenwyck's stomach...!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone backs farther away as Steenwyck falls. Steenwyck lays gasping, eyes huge. He tries crawl...

Katrina rises to her feet and stands; staring wide-eyed at the horror. Ichabod moves toward her.

Steenwyck lays still with a bloody gurgle, face down. Baltus looks to all the horrified people around him.

CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind: its bloodied point bursting out through his breastbone...

<DIRECTION>
Baltus gasps, stunned...he drops the gun, looks down to clutch the post. Blood streams out of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod catches Katrina as she swoons. Horrorstruck, he hugs her...and thus notices that hanging on a ribbon around her neck is the little carved bauble taken from the neck of the dead Crone. Almost at the same time, Ichabod sees that on the flagstones where Katrina was lying there is now a "Drawing" done in chalk, identical to the "Evil Eye" drawing he found under his bed.

The cart is being pulled at a walking pace by a single horse. The CART MAN walking, holding the bridle.

The cart man pauses, seeing a RIDER approaching, traveling in the same direction as Ichabod's coach.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD FROM VAN TASSEL ESTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach hits the long straight road, rumbling at top speed away from the Van Tassel Estate, into the forest...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>

<ICHABOD>

</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, sir...you must have something in your bag of tricks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing that will help us, I am afraid. Take the reins...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath takes them. Ichabod gives Van Ripper's rifle to Katrina, then crawls back across the coach roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod gets to a baggage area at the rear, struggling to open a storage box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod opens the box and pulls out a jagged HAND SAW.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod looks. The Horseman rides up, SWINGS his sword...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the other side of the trail...coming along side again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep him off! Block him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Masbath guides the horses over. The Horseman must fall behind to avoid the wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One wheel hits a large rock...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod bounces, falling, drops the saw...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs off the side of the coach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The saw clatters away on the trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod tries for better purchase. He grips the coach door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina climbs to offer her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take my hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod reaches to her, but the coach door falls open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's PISTOL falls from the holster and is lost on the trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod clings helplessly to the door as branches slam him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEHIND THE TRAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman gets to his feet. Ahead, Daredevil stands waiting, giving a SCREECH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AHEAD ON THE TRAIL NEAR THE TREE OF THE DEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina and Ichabod rejoin Mashath, climb off the coach to examine the ruined wheel, panicked.

<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to get out of the open somehow. Quick, follow me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to run, but suddenly falter, seeing... Riding over the crest of the hill, comes Lady Van Tassel, on her white horse, with Ichahod's lost pistol in her hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<LADY_VAN_TASSEL>

</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel points her gun at Katrina.
</DIRECTION>
<LADY_VAN_TASSEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, do run. And jump. And skip.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she takes aim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now let's see a somersault!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_VAN_TASSEL>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichahod makes a move toward Lady Van Tassel, but Lady Van Tassel aims and FIRES -- shoots Ichahod in the chest! Ichahod goes down...
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath cries out, falls to his knees beside Ichabod. Katrina moves toward Ichahod... Lady Van Tassel rides forward -- GRABS Katrina by the hair, PULLING HER, riding off toward the Horseman...Ichabod lays clutching the smoldering wound in his chest, gasping. Young Masbath holds him...
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God...no...no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel drags Katrina by the hair as Katrina screams and struggles and kicks.
</DIRECTION>

The Horseman keeps coming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel stops her horse, halfway to the Horseman, drops Katrina and starts riding back, shouting...
</DIRECTION>
<LADY_VAN_TASSEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There she is. Take her, she's yours!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_VAN_TASSEL>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina gets up to run, stumbles, falls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman strides after...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up the field, Ichabod gets to his knees, feeling his chest with both hands, not quite understanding, struggling to shake off delirium...
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you're...you're not dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<ICHABOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not...yet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod looks up, trying to comprehend...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel had turned her horse, her back to us, keeping her distance from the Horseman. Beyond her, Katrina flees this direction with the Horseman at her heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod's focused on something...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black SADDLEBAG slung over Lady Van Tassel's horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod rises out of pure determination, runs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina runs...the Horseman is closing on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel watches, grinning, but at the last second something catches her eye and she turns, just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod LEAPS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TACKLES Lady Van Tassel off of her horse, taking her down to the ground HARD...her bag falling open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman's skull rolling out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod scrambles toward the skull -- but falls, halted. Lady Van Tassel grips his leg, holding him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath grabs a heavy, broken TREE LIMB off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman is mere yards behind Katrina...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod struggles to get free from Lady Van Tassel, can't break her grip when, BANG -- Young Masbath SMASHES Lady Van Tassel over the head with the tree limb. She's out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman catches Katrina...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod scrambles free, running, reaching for the skull...grasping it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman holds Katrina ready by her hair as she falls to her knees, screaming and struggling. The Horseman raises his sword...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod rises, THROWS the skull with all his might...
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horseman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
The skull spins through the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman suddenly drops Katrina, reaches up with one hand... catches the skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina runs. Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls. Together, they back away from the Horseman...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman holds the skull out...brings it to his shoulders, to its rightful place. THUNDER POUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the Horseman's throat and grip the skull...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath watches in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman's reformation continues. Muscle forms. Liquids become solids. He is made whole once more, the same evil, human face we saw in Baltus's stories.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face. Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING. The Horseman replaces his sword, climbs into the saddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rides toward Katrina and Ichabod, but he does not want them. They are so exhausted they fall down. Young Masbath comes to stand with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman rides away with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod and Katrina watch him go. They look at each other, then kiss gratefully. Ichabod looks to Young Masbath...
</DIRECTION>
<ICHABOD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, Young Masbath?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weary, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MASBATH>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod holds out his arm. Masbath comes over. They embrace. Katrina touches the burned bullet hole in Ichabod's clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I had lost you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod reaches into his clothing, takes out a BOOK he kept in an inner pocket close to his heart...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOOK OF SPELLS with a bullet lodged in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina wraps her arms around Ichabod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOOFBEATS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman enters the clearing, holding on to Lady Van Tassel. Ahead, the Tree of the dead awaits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel is awakening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Horseman grips Lady Van Tassel's hair, pulling her face up closer to his, just as she opens her eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lady Van Tassel screams...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Horseman brings his face to meet hers, about to engage in a KISS, his jagged teeth open wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, the twisted tree's wound opens, deep and glowing, as Daredevil picks up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daredevil JUMPS in the air just as a LIGHTNING BOLT blasts down from the sky, striking the Horseman...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS OF LIGHT, entering the tree!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence and smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand sticks out from the tight-shut suture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood as her fingers curl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A coach pulls up to Ichabod's home. Ichabod is the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets off, goes and opens the coach door. He helps Katrina down. Next, Young Masbath sticks his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Katrina holds Young Masbath's hand. Ichabod comes to hold Katrina's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STRAY CAT watches them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Masbath looks entranced at the BUSTLING METROPOLIS.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MASBATH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my!

<ICHABOD>

(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...New York, New York! Just in time for the new century! It's the modern age, Katrina!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHABOD>
<KATRINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's always the modern age, Ichabod ...but the ancient ones endure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATRINA>
<DIRECTION>
Large snowflakes begin to fall upon the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod puts an arm around Katrina and the other arm around Masbath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAT is black with one white paw...the Cat from Ichabod's dreams... The CAT turns to look at the trio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU - The CAT'S EYES ARE HUMAN, INTELLIGENT, KINDLY... They are Ichabod's Mother's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath enter Ichabod's house, as the SNOW continues to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
