	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
	</DIALOGUE>

Danny paces back and forth.

<DIRECTION>
Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly. LISTENING TO THE WATER.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one notices.

THROUGH THE WINDOW - TWO FIGURES CROSS IN FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CAR. THE ENGINE REMAINS RUNNING.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOICES SHOUTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny freezes, not sure what to do. His eyes dart around for a weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a large plumber's wrench and goes to the bathroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE SHOTS. SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL BULLETS slam through the bathroom wall, one striking Danny in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slumps to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PANDEMONIUM continues in the front room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a BULLET HOLE about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall next to Danny's head. He puts his eye to the hole and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning the room. Stopping on ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... LIZ. In the confusion, she has managed to hide from the intruders. She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall. She clings tightly to the curtains, her hands shaking violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE THE CURTAIN RINGS - pulled taught by Liz's grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny adjusts his gaze through the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning to the other side of the room. Bo and the other guy sprawled on the floor. INTRUDER ONE stands over them, only his legs visible.

INTRUDER ONE Let's go!

INTRUDER TWO emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag. They start to head out the front door when ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC "TING".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching. It takes an eternity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny grabs the wrench again. Tries to get to his feet but slips back down, either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared. His hand is shaking violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks through the hole again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE HOLE - Liz still staring at Danny. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTENCE at a agonizing slow pace, then stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUN, ever so slowly, enters FRAME. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Liz's eyes as they widen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSE UP on Danny's eye peering through the hole. A SHOT IS FIRED. His eye closes.

Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head. Danny freezes ...
</DIRECTION>
<TANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that answer your question?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I fight. I fight and I die like a man.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a fucking coward, Flynne. You lived like one and now you're gonna die like one.

</TANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks up at the gun, his face a blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glock semi-automatic 9 mm ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BARREL OF THE GUN. ALL SOUND FADES OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE INTO THE BARREL OF THE GUN. THE BLACK KID'S FACE APPEARS INSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip, fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel, 22 ounces, double action and a ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK FLASHES of all the shots Danny fired with the Glock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- TWO at Big Bill - FOUR at the guys at the table - ONE at Garcetti - THREE at Tanner
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KID AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and a TEN ROUND magazine ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
ON DANNY. Still staring at the gun. He knows the gun is empty. He notices something on the floor ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... THE LOADED SYRINGE.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or did I say ELEVEN?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
Danny trying to remember.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which was it, mister? Was it ten or was it eleven?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks down at the syringe again. Tanner sees it too.
</DIRECTION>
<TANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late to be a hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANNER>
<DIRECTION>
Danny picks up the syringe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUN IS EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the plunger, dosing him with the meth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe. His eyes roll back as he convulses from the drugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny struggles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in the throws of a holy possession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat. A LONG WET WEEZE ESCAPES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone. He looks brain dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't. He keeps looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood. He looks down at his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny. TANNER'S WHEEZING CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Garcetti nods slightly. He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny goes over to the couch and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted. TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE. Blank. Devoid of anything. He stuffs Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the gun out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it. The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again. THE WHEEZING CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny starts crying. Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps up. Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his clip into him. When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger ... over and over again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT. FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny dressed in his "Tom" clothes. He limps over to the bed and picks up the trumpet case. Carries it over to the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny staring at his reflection. He lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, you're Danny Flynne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there. Quincey holds a nine millimeter with a muzzle suppressor.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a motherfucking rat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots Danny in the stomach. Danny slumps to the floor. His cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colette freaks.
</DIRECTION>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you wouldn't kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lied to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops. My bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colette, what happened? Didn't the cops ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops came. But they didn't find nothing. Turns out their C.I. game 'em some bad information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks from Quincey to Colette. Colette looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this is what you get, homes.

<QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I brought in a rat of my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You set me up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny can't help from laughing at the irony. Beads of sweat are forming on his blanched face. He looks at Colette with a wry smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, it's not what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I owed them money ... a lot of money ... they didn't give me a choice. You know how it works. When I got to know you, I tried to back out ... that's when they did this ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she indicates the bruises)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I didn't want to see you get hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe. He looks over at Quincey.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She selling me a bill, home boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincey shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, she ain't lying. She took a pretty good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less. But not this bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was very touching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are we here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They threatened to kill my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>

(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Danny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have taken.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Danny touches her face.) (beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn, you're beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES. The fire spreads quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincey grabs her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCEY>

	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<DIRECTION>
The drapes go up in flames. Quincey puts the gun to the back of her head.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna die here with him or come with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCEY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colette, go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<COLETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLETTE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter needs you. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The fire continues to spread. Colette kisses Danny on the lips. Quincey pulls her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, cutting off any escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny breathing hard. He gets up. Staggers over to the mirror where his trumpet is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, a smile on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to play SAETA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to the opening scene. The whole room ablaze. Danny lying on the bed, playing the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is it? Who am I after it's all said and done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Pieces of the roof start falling in.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Avenging angel or plain old Judas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He stops playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You decide, friend. You decide.

He closes his eyes.

<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too tired ... so you decide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit. What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
A linoleum floor rushes underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Linoleum. This must be hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF. The tattoo smiles and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<TATTO>
<DIRECTION>
(warped, distorted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang in there buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATTO>
<DIRECTION>
Stairs rush by underneath. Then another hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S P.O.V. - a bright white light at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. What a fucking cliché.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
On Danny's face, floating through the hall. His eyes fluttering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING TOWARDS the light. Closer. Closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's eyes close, his head droops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO WHITE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... JIMMY staring down at him with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny blinks his eyes again. Looks up at ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... A PARAMEDIC working on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paramedic continues to work on Danny. His eyes slowly close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT. FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop. He looks like a new man.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've had some time to think about it and it's pretty simple after all. I guess it's like the man said - "Man is the measure of all things." I should know. I ran the gamut. Avenging Angel, Judas, loving husband, prodigal son, prince of Denmark. I was all of those things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom Van Allen got his revenge. Good for Tom. And Danny Flynne? He got gut-shot for being the low-life rat that he was. Sucks for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks through the window of the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what about this guy? Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny enters the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny takes a seat at the counter. Colette turns and sees him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I like his chances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at one another for a beat, then smile. Colette pours him some coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really like his chances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

FADE OUT.

THE END
