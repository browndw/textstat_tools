EXT. CITYSCAPE SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the frame. The building is neither past nor future in design but a bit of both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend, the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper levels of a plush shopping precinct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHOPPING PRECINT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying, ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to listen to HELPMANN.

	Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

<HELPMANN>

	Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -

</HELPMANN>
<DIRECTION>
Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow" turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames. WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are being played by a Salvation Army style band calling themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is busy, all is well with the world.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...

<HELPMANN>

	That is why we always insist on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges. These terrorists are not pulling their weight, and it's absolutely right and fair that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention and the Information Retrieval Procedures used in their interrogation.

<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in- tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.

The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.

The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away compiling a typed list of names under the heading "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention & Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE- UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F. ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER, John D. ... Every name begins with T.

<DIRECTION>
The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs, hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.

The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW, Peter...

INT. BUTTLE FLAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune. PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six. BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.

Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the floor above.

INT. JILL'S FLAT NIGHT

The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror, the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body of a MAN in uniform.

As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid, slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the ceiling. Things become immediately clearer
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in the window from the outside and enters that way. Most alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal and violent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an official document. It goes something like this:
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hereby inform you under powers entrusted to me under Section 47, Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number 438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald, residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri La Towers, has been invited to assist the Ministry of Information with certain enquiries, the nature of which may be ascertained on completion of application form BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this date, and that he is liable to certain obligations as specified in Council Order 173497, including financial restitutions which may or may not be incurred if Information Retrieval procedures beyond those incorporated in Article 7 subsections 8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit information leading to permanent arrest - notification of which will he served with the time period of 5 working days as stipulated by law.

INT. RECORD CLERK'S POOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs, tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN. Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch, and all the screens change to something which looks very like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V. starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled. He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration. He presses an intercom.

He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

The only sound again. He goes back to his desk. He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes with anger, and presses the intercom again.

EXT. SKY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird- like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect. Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then, banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers, looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial ballet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble. SAM looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive, monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and soars upwards with a mighty rush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless structures. And then she is finally lost from view somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis. SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid. No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something in the distance. far below him a dark procession is wending its way through the narrow passages... away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their tracks. They've seen something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back. Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces are the same except for the manner in which they have decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The FORCES are massed ready to charge. CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the constant dribble from their cracked mouths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable. Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the fearsome horde. Unarmed!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing madly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack! Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly, they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks around - confused.

SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee- maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall panels have Central Services logos on them with the admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures of wide beautiful vistas.

	Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound worried.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK has been talking.

	Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -

<DIRECTION>
As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying to see what is written on the forms, peering over her shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to report a wrongful arrest.

	Where do I get it stamped?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Information Adjustments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated TECHNICIANS.

INT. MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE DAY

SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.

	Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on either side of her face. When I say several inches that's just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over this freak show.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here ... and there ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself. There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing around, raving.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>

	I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.

	No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -

	Well they won't know you when I've finished with you.

The DOCTOR reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured marker. He starts colouring up her face with strokes of different coloured markers.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First we must eliminate the excess derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid tissues under the eyes ... And now the forehead ... Zip! I lift the wrinkles and worry lines right up into the wi- into the hairline, comme ca ...

SAM looks disgusted.

	And now the template ... There ... there ... there ... Now a bit of sticky ... There we go!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Already she is twice as beautiful as she was before - voila!

The DOCTOR moves his body aside, revealing MRS LOWRY's face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in cellophane held in shape by cellotape. SAM stares at her.

INT. POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE) DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place while they are going through the sort of security checks familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(in full flow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not listening, mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru security check. It turns out to have been activated by a gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of executive toy which we have seen twice before.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a present for my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?

</SAM>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's something for executives.

At this point the MAITRE D arrives on the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MAITRE_D>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you again. Merry Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAITRE_D>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<SPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring, potted palms combine to impress us with their sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating right through the middle of a particularly valuable- looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string quartet accompanying them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother, I thought we were going to be able to talk .... Oh God, she's got what's he name with her.

At this moment the food arrives. SPIRO elaborately lifts off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the plates of food. Each order looks identical - a big splodge of brown lumpy stuff. The only differences between the lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which were on the menus.

They are just about to dip into their respective splodges when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is blasted out of the wall to the kitchen.

MOTHER raises her arm to gain the attention of the MAITRE D who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency. The activity in the background has increased throughout the conversation. The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens blaring. Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting WAITERS.

EXT. BRILLIANT SKY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They are rising up and away from the monolithic stone skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm taking you to a safe place. A place where they will never be able to get at us ... ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic - about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises from the centre of this bizarre place.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way they can approach us without being seen. You're safe here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another. All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the platform but it's too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is engulfed in the black awfulness.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat. It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath. GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall gasping for air. CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.

SAM slams the phone down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARKNESS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way and SAM crashes through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch he came through was the front of one of the millions of files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms. The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN (as seen on TV).
</DIRECTION>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GENT>
<DIRECTION>
The platform carries them along the files.
</DIRECTION>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You mean you've got ...

</SAM>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must save the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENT>
<DIRECTION>
The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He reaches inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the Sword Of Truth ... and this the Helmet Of Justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENT>
<DIRECTION>
As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a cape.
</DIRECTION>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this. completes the outfit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENT>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer in.
</DIRECTION>
<GENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENT>
<DIRECTION>
As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
</DIRECTION>

INT. SAM'S FLAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone rings. He staggers over to it.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sound at the kitchen door turns SAM's head - and ours - just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
</DIRECTION>
<PHONE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the phone down and your hands up.

</PHONE_VOICE>
<SAM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Who is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle- aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
</DIRECTION>
<TUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.

TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors, leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.

TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.

</TUTTLE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

<DIRECTION>
By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat. TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a wall panel.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, what was that business with the gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the space behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<TUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUTTLE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying this is illegal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes ... BRAZIL!!
</DIRECTION>

	Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.

(indicating the torch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.

He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed. SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds inspiration.

We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind him, we are now in ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KURTZMAN'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office. During the brief opening and closing of the door we just manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing, "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". KURTZMAN is too worried to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(hysterically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God you're here! We're in terrible trouble! Look at this! Look at this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A cheque.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The refund for Tuttle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tuttle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN way out of his depth, until -
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try next of kin.

<KURTZMAN>

(a revelation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next of kin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
SAM punches more keys.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	27156789/074328/K.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
SAM has been efficiently punching this in.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Into memory. Now ... Central Banking ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well done.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(fervently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't come back! Please don't come back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the. vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up. From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again, Sam" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(hysterically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he thumps his hand hard on the desk top)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He picks up the offending cheque)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Under this tirade SAM has begun to hum "BRAZIL" - not entirely sure what inspired him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(depressed. Not really believing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's brilliant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf of different coloured papers.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it for you. Authorise the cheque. What's the address?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
KURTZMAN scribbles it down for him.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. What do I do next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(separating the and blue sheets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
KURTZMAN takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers but his hand is giving him trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(exhausted after all the emotion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the pen from him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM signs the cheque and receipts. A big CLOSE UP shows that he is scribbling KURTZMAN's signature. SAM pockets the papers and the pen.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>

EXT. MOTORWAY TUNNEL DAY CUT to SAM at the wheel of the little car, beetling along in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM in interior of the Messerschmidt. He is singing along to an obscure arrangement of "BRAZIL".

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTORWAY TUNNEL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily progressing in arterial tunnel. CUT to very tiny exit sign: Exit 49.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM peering at sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry roars by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUTTLE FLATS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work - graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the background is the grim reality of the massive housing tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(super polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Can you tell me ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eff off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<DIRECTION>
SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTTLE FLATS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them - still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns towards the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR DAY CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SAM Mrs Buttle
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Mrs Buttle?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM stands not knowing what to do. SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat. CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs Buttle ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTTLE SITTING ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting absolutely still at a small table by the only (still broken) window in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Mrs Buttle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm from the Ministry of Information.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come to give you a cheque.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the table to tempt MRS BUTTLE into a flicker of interest but she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she does not respond.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(indicting cheque)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MRS_BUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mistake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BUTTLE>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(encouraged)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh ... what happened to the ...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets nothing back.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, my bringing this here is rather unorthodox ... Usually any payments are made through the central computer ... but, er ... there were certain difficulties, and rather than cause delay, we thought you might appreciate this now ... it being Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_BUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband's dead, isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BUTTLE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MRS_BUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done with his body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BUTTLE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about it ... I'm really just delivering the cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind signing these receipts
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(producing blue and pink receipts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go and leave you in peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and throws them in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MRS_BUTTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BUTTLE>
<DIRECTION>
SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the BOY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<SAM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<DIRECTION>
SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up, dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only the empty space of the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Stop! Come back!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.

<DIRECTION>
SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds himself in -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIMILAR CORRIDOR DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girl ... fair hair ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JILL'S FLAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is carrying a suitcase and bundles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM rushes down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLOCK OF FLATS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared. The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! It was nothing to do with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up. He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him expressionlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL BUTTLE standing over him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away.

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away. After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECORD CLERKS POOL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport pool onto me ... You don't know anything about a personnel transporter gone missing do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up personal dossier information like "age", "height", "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes", "distinguishing marks" etc.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(preoccupied)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A "personnel" transporter? They've got it wrong. I had a personal transporter. I'll do the paperwork tomorrow -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.

<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?

	Can I forget it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a relief!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(on reflection)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall probably have nightmares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at the bottom
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn! Blast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.

</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!

</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never signed the form.

<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did it for you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what you wanted isn't it?

</KURTZMAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, before they turn the lights out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZMAN>
<DIRECTION>
SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some distance away, and before they get there all the lights go out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.

INT. TRANSPORT CAGE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a tower block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S CORRIDOR EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he. Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about something he heads for his own front door.

SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and banging going on somewhere behind the wall.

For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.

They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving SAM in the ruins of his flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the DREAM GIRL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONDUIT FOREST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him. Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLOUDS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent. Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STRANGE LANDSCAPE ANTI-DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages. The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light. The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated, destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach - a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback. A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward. But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into the light. There, under several meters of the earth's crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and begins chopping the tethers away. The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands. Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.

INT. SAM'S FLAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible song and dance routine.

SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him. The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less formally dresses than SAM.

INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to WIDE SHOT of massive imposing lobby - much like the Records lobby - but this one is very austere. No crowds. No statues. No decoration. Not even the ever-present security checks. Impressive. And a bit unnerving. Framed in the doorway is a lone TINY FIGURE. CUT to CLOSE UP. It's SAM. He hesitates and then enters. CUT to video screen. The video camera follows SAM across the lobby - til he stops in tight profile at Reception Desk. We tilt up revealing SAM standing facing us just beyond the monitor which is on the desk.

INT. 30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into view around a corner at the far end of the rather long corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals, disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks down into something like this.

SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM follows. Silence has descended again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace. As the scrum reaches SAM he gathers his nerve and jumps right in beside WARREN, and keeps going.

WARREN whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and EXPEDITERS leaving SAM standing dumfounded at the entrance to his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys - gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas & Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books) against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result. Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall, and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops, somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge. Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR DAY

Cut to SAM coming out of his office, turning right and walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads: OFFICER DV/048.

As is his custom, SAM opens the door without knocking.

INT. LIME'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM'S POV. Here is an office much like his. It's the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall. The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking, round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He is unaware of SAM.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ICY SEA ANTI-DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone. Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull, but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches at the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.

INT. THE LIFT

SAM presses the button for the 50th floor. The lift doors close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning vent in the ceiling.

INT. ROOM 500l DAY

Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant- looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who, busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently mouths the words ...

She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all the different copies.

Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area, SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them, a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk with a large collection of executive toys and other tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Are you office 412/L?

The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He continues vibrating his temples.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Er, excuse me!

Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He continues over to the TECHNICIAN.

	Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.

	There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.

	So how ...?

INT. CORRIDOR DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM steps out of Room 5001, newly suited with old suit over arm. TWO GUARDS are guiding a BAGGEE down the corridor ahead of him. Suddenly, the BAGGEE breaks away from his GUARDS and begins to cannonball down the corridor directly at SAM. SAM is flattened against the wall as the BAGGEE rockets by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to GUARDS strolling past SAM. CUT to BAGGEE running full tilt to the end of the corridor, smashing into the wall, bouncing back, getting up (now cross-ways in the corridor), bouncing off that wall, then the wall behind him, then ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIFT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing with the PORTER.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the Ministry.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention. SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

	Hey, you - get out of there.

SAM fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to the lobby before JILL leaves. He has forgotten he is wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because JILL's dossier is covering it.

JILL has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully drops. She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the response to her hitting the desk. The GUARDS close in.

SAM rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. He can't believe the sight that greets him. He responds instinctively,

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP! Let her go!

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the GUARDS behind him come through the door. He doesn't have a clue what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of GUARDS they snap attention. Confused he looks around and then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to attention. Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant to make the next move. SAM breaks the silence.

SAM sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the pavement. He lets go of JILL for a moment to grab at the papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers. SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the corner. He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after JILL.

We PULL BACK and lift off to see that the beautiful countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels. From a bird's eye POV we see that the land behind the hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc.

EXT. POWER PLANT DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys, huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... It is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective clothing and hard hats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ... The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking around. Something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of the power plant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LORRY CAB DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the despatcher's hut. He looks around uneasily and then he start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the cab door.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't act guilty. Act like me. I'm just getting on with my job. Or, are you just getting on with yours?

</JILL>
<DIRECTION>
The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the house suspended from the crane starts moving through the sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a package out from behind the seat. She glances surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel inside her jacket she walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LORRY LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution - is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on the side of the building that illustrates, almost identically, the action we have just seen along with the warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".

The impression is that the place could be an abandoned airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated houses) standing in the open others protected under simple areas of roofing. Each group of Assorted Supplies lies inside the squares of the grid of streets. The streets are eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. The effect is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows and garishly lit mountains of stuff.

At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and plaster dust. He rushes over to her.

She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured. Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys. She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with the severed limbs of a shop dummy.

JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable. SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED. ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is attending.

The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It makes a passable club.

SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.

The BAGGEES hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black Maria. SAM is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket, with his badge prominently displayed.

SAM recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his desk in his office. He is bruised and battered and has a black eye. His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture. Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high energy circus. LIME is with them.

INT. SAM'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM storms back into his office. Reaching a peak of frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. Within seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It doesn't return a second time, periodically something passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up. At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it. There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to his door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>

INT. SAM'S CORRIDOR CONTINUATION

Every door in the corridor has been opened by the occupants of the room. All the occupants stick their heads into the corridor, all gazing with SAM at the variously coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes the intestines of the pneumatic system.

SAM is dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to JACK to is trying to distance himself from him.

EXT. MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL NIGHT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck was parked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUST AROUND THE CORNER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the pavement unsure his next move. The street light is reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru the inner wall of the great stone ship.

<DREAM_GIRL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DREAM_GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the crack shafts across the space in which they find themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful, shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT. The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in front of himself in an almost religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused. Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down. Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards. He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground. The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The wounds continue to bleed fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable. SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell tolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUST AROUND THE CORNER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance. SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows, is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice comes from behind him.

The Elysian Fields train arrives clattering. SAM and JILL are the only passengers to emerge. They can't keep their hands off one another. This is young love at its freshest and most exciting. SAM looks up and down the platform cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train clatters off again into the darkness. SAM and JILL approach SAM's front door. He puts a key in the door and tries to open the door but has some difficulty. Something creaks. He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..

SAM enters, followed by JILL. His breath immediately starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. The flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then deep frozen. Icicles are hanging down from everywhere. The flat looks like a scrap dump. Every wall has spilled out its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of the available space and making progress through the flat difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work. They are impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing and look more like spacemen. Their voices however belong to SPOOR and DOWSER.

INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval reception It's late. GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating cleaning machinery. SAM approaches the DESK PORTER who is playing with the executive toy SAM gave him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTER>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?

</SAM>
<PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PORTER>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Dawson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment, disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched LIME who hobbles across the lobby without seeing SAM, who slips down the stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction. They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOIR_MASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, Arthur, you're going flat on that G. It's your breathing. Take a breath on the end. of the previous line, after Noel. Right, one, two, three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOIR_MASTER>
<DIRECTION>
The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall. CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<HELPMANN>
<DIRECTION>
(V/O)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me, but we were close friends, and I keep his name alive at the office every day. It's as though he's there speaking to me. "'ere I am, J.H."

<DIRECTION>
SAM is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the keyboard. The lift judders and star s to ascend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MR HELPMANN'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM steps out of lift into an ante-room. No-one is there. Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the office. No reply. He slowly opens door.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by an elaborate computer console in a side room. It occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the machine lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15 REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE. This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns to leave. The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches on the machine. He has he answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S FLAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM enters the flat. JILL is nowhere to be seen. The lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door beams a shaft of bright light. Music pours forth ... it is "BRAZIL".

(cautiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through. There is JILL but, transformed. She is wearing one of SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL notices him and smiles.

INT. STONE SHIP ANTI-DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that. Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns. The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light. He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day. far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is exultant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pull back from the sun through a window. The light falls on SAM's smiling sleeping face. Showly he wakes. He little by little remembers where he is and reaches over for JILL. She isn't there. Sam panics.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>

But crash !!! it's a raid! Like a giant drill a whirling cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of Mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole in the BUTTLE ceiling ... CUTS show doors being burst open by SECURITY TROOPS. JILL and SAM are frozen in panic. SECURITY TROOPS are sliding down a fireman's pole" from the hole in the ceiling.

In absolute inky darkness, SAM and the CAMERA move through space and time marked only by voices and sounds encountered on the way. This sound-sequence fades in and out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. We hear:

The SECURITY GUARD peers in for a moment and then steps back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk. They are looking up at SAM/us.

	<DIALOGUE>
	93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list of misdemeanours here, haven't you? All this is going to take time and money, and I'm afraid, according to your bank statement and credit rating here, you're likely to be in deep financial trouble by the end of it. Now, either you plead guilty to say, seven or eight of these charges, which'll bring the costs down to within your reach, or you can borrow a sum to be negotiated, from us, at very competitive rates. We can offer you something at say, eleven and a half per cent, over thirty years. But you will have to buy insurance to qualify for his scheme.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, since you've elected to plead not guilty on all these charges, you'd be well advised to take some sort of insurance cover. Preferably comprehensive, or if you'd prefer, something more specific - say, against electrical charges over f70.00. And for food and accommodation costs of say, £800.00. Detention can be a very expensive business.
	</DIALOGUE>

<OFFICIAL_F>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, before we bore you with the small print perhaps you'd like to tell us whether you'd like to sign this insurance acceptance form or not. Think carefully before you decide. Thinking ahead in financial matters is always the wise course.

<DIRECTION>
The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view through the flap.

CUT to SAM struggling with the FORCES OF DARKNESS. He is overwhelmed by the black hordes. They fill the screen. SAM disappears under their onslaught. A pause. Then SAM is raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the FORCES. Strong hands hold him. The maniacal laughter starts up. SAM is turned in its direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES. Rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. We can see the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom of Knowledge in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM looks terrified. As the thing hovers above SAM in all its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.

SAM freezes as the interior becomes invisible. There in the billowing blackness is the GIRL. She is beckoning.

INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments. Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions near the distant door they hand over documents to the white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	11/AFT/607, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then proceed to the door and take up positions on either side of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS. A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway. After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.
</DIRECTION>

SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's pole", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand, leaps through the hole. TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into the room.

INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to the RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance. Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover fire The PORTER sits behind his desk watching the battle on his bank of monitors.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2ND GROUP
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick! We've only got thirty seconds to get clear!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out through the door into the large empty forecourt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORECOURT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights. Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are totally exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are cut down left and right. Desperately they battle their way across the open space. Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover. KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated. SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits. Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected its load skywards. The night sky is full of white rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM and SAM runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY PASSAGES NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM runs madly through paper-littered passages
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHOPPING PRECINCT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them. Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his foot. He tries shaking it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm. Still more paper blows against him. He is having difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him. He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business, apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley - and watches it career down the steps of the shopping precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE. The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile. But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and dashes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S FLAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind blows the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling). SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes forwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching SAM running towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<MATTHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
(piously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A sad loss. Your mother was with her at the end. The doctor said there was no pain.

<DIRECTION>
EXT A CORNER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops and through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.
</DIRECTION>
<SPIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you could make it. Right this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPIRO>
<DIRECTION>
SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in stepped seats on three sides of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large, rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it, etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.

<VICAR>
<DIRECTION>
(in background)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At these times of giving and receiving let's remember the greatest gift of all: not a gift to be spurned, not a gift to be opened and carelessly set on one side, not a gift to be taken back and changed, but the gift of eternal life. Mrs Terrain has just received that most wonderful of all gifts. She came to us physically new, she goes hence from us not so physically new. But the spirit never grows old. And in the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy forever.

</VICAR>

</DIRECTION>
<SFX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TERRIFIC CRASH.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SFX>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes against the coffin which topples over spilling its contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his mouth and dashes through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things, hurting himself, getting up running. He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams. The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and right through it, always there is a chance of turnings. Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead end. At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through this pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS, TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape. He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HABITATION UNIT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully. He looks around but there is only one window and it is shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HABITATION UNIT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up, and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the shuttered window which is at the front end of the house, in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him. SAM sobs with relief and love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts the rise beyond which lies ... looking more than ever ... JILL'S VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...

INT. TRAVELLING LORRY NIGHT

Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead. The reverse shot shows us JILL driving and SAM next to her. They glance at each other.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SMALL ROAD EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then breasts the rise beyond which lies ... A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a basket of eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE MORNING

SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes, locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.

EXT. HOUSE AND GARDEN MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending. And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They both shake their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HELPMANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got away from us, Jack.

INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His eyes are open but miles away. His face is wreathed in a benign and very happy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann. He's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful glorious sky ever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June, We stood beneath an amber moon, And softly murmured 'Some day soon' We kissed and clung together, Then, tomorrow was another day. The morning found me miles away, With still a million things to say, Now, when twilight beams the sky above, Recalling thrills of our love, There's one thing I'm certain of, Return, I will, To old Brazil."
</DIRECTION>
