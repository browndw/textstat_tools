BABIES in bassinets, isolettes, incubators. BABIES sleeping, BABIES blinking, BABIES cooing, BABIES chirping, BABIES squalling.

It's the SQUALLING BABIES, the ones with pinched faces and tiny bunched fists, that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in Military Uniforms. (Their anonymity is assured by the angles from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are the backs of heads.)

The cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in identical gray overalls. As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle, amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears SUPERED over the scene...

It's creepy: the same children two years older, milling about a bare cement room, apparently unsupervised. They ought to look cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut hair. Again a date is SUPERED over the scene --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1996.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him.

It's a harmless child's kick. But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS, he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again. And again.

Puzzles. Fingers fit shapes into holes. The puzzles aren't fun puzzles; they're obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or both. SIX-YEAR-OLDS now, the boys perform in a grim room under fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles, observing.

This a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold weather, but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit, their faces hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes.

Except for the STRAGGLER, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear, obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling, struggling to keep his feet...

Suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a MILITARY FIGURE, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing. Before the weapon can flash a laser bean, AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages the target and it disappears back into the grass. The boys, EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close, sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS expertly mow down menacing MILITARY FIGURES while holding their fire when ANIMAL TARGETS or UNARMED CIVILIANS and CHILDREN appear.

The eighteen-year-old on point is RILEY, a muscular redhead. TODD is right behind him as a date is SUPERED over the scene...

Suddenly multiple TARGETS appear, charging.

<DIRECTION>
BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA! First TARGET down!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, pans for a nearby SOLDIER TARGET. But the SOLDIER TARGET zips behind the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, taking cover, weapon pointed at RILEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For half a second RILEY hesitates!

An extra-terrestrial city ravaged by war to such a degree that it bears an uncanny resemblance to Dresden/Earth in 1945 after the fire-bombing! The architecture, even in ruins, recalls old Europe, and the streets are narrow, as in before (or after) automobiles.

Bursts of AUTOMATIC FIRE, occasional MORTAR BLASTS. A spooky battle between unseen SOLDIERS is taking place in seemingly deserted streets and alleyways. And SUPERED over the gloomy scene...

TODD is sitting on a bunk, shirtless. His new rank has been tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and another scar that distorts his lip slightly. The names of various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an official record, not a decoration. TODD is silent, staring into space. The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts, fatigues, sleepwear. WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE...
</DIRECTION>

The WORDS FADE AWAY, the silence continues, the rain BEATS on the barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch the rain beat on the windowpane. They look like robots...used robots, made individual only by their different scars.

He looks straight ahead, unblinking, and so does the one next to him, and the next one. Twenty of them are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was once a station of some sort. They don't seem to respond to the chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights leaking sixty feet above them.

Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright- eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by, glowing with satisfaction.

The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and a sense of emptiness to it.

As TODD glances at them, the NEW SOLDIERS look back unblinkingly. (The VETERANS, in spite of their impassive expressions, look very human compared to the NEW SOLDIERS. Their battle scars mark them as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectly-muscled young giants across from them.)

Separated by fifteen yards, the two groups of SOLDIERS, the NEW and the VETERAN, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly into space as they await orders. Occasionally a VETERAN will rub his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away deliberately, expressionless. Nobody flinches when a big door opens and pale light streams in.

Breathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain. Something makes him glance back over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he looks back again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD continues at the same even place. He doesn't look back again until he feels closeness. Then he looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly, keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's. The bigger man moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine, inexorable.

As TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we...

The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK, and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD. Still dripping vet, the muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but not desperately.

<MEKUM>

	Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological. The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind.

A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer, takes the form of a runner running. It's TODD, still moving at the same pace, his face like stone.

TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes.

TODD salutes and lopes toward ten chains that dangle from the rafters sixty feet above, grabs one, and starts up it, hand over hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEKUM watches TODD climb, then looks at CHURCH who is looking at him expectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEKUM grins at CHURCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then MEKUM looks back at TODD, not hurrying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is thirty feet up and climbing, passing the eight inch circular "platforms" or footholds in the chain every ten feet.

<DIRECTION>
MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied. His brow is knit, something's bothering him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart. Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...

CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.

SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.

Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up.

They all look at MEKUM. Is this the chink in the armor? The new soldiers can't fight?

<CHURCH>

	"No"?

<MEKUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not fair. No contest. Send two more of your old ones up.

Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned. They exchange a glance.
</DIRECTION>
<MEKUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead.

<DIRECTION>
RUBRICK shrugs, turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in a group on the cement floor.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up the chains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the veterans, ROMERO and GOINES, leap immediately to their feet and climb rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOAN, CHURCH, and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks confidently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE. They're still facing each other across the sixty foot drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight motion in his chain so that he spins slowly. That way, as the veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him, men!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH! TODD is hit hard in the face even as he starts to swing. WHAM! MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches, slides...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON. WHAM! MELTON hits him again, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with his free hand and with both feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes mercilessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW. He's managed to get a foothold on one of the mini-platforms. His face horribly bloody, he looks up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly hurl ROMERO downward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROMERO rockets down past TODD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH! ROMERO's body crunches against the cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's been clubbing him from behind...GOINES! GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, swings after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand. His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him hard, and WHAM! MELTON hits him back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a "platform" foothold on his chain five feet above the swinging fighters. TODD looks down on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free hand and strangling him with the other arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW. For the first time a frown of concern wrinkles his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders. MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps for air, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward even as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD goes for face with his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM! MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of MELTON's injury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank impassive faces, RILEY among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD. SMASH! SMASH! SMASH! MELTON's elbows drive back into TODD's ribs. The breath knocked out of him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites furiously, drawing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD grits his teeth in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is losing his grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY watches below, his face a mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELTON bites and elbows furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins to fall and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand for twenty feet until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't hold on any longer! TODD plunges the last thirty feet to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of ROMERO's broken body below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sudden silence!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken.

It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one- eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...

	COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, YOU MISERABLE THIRD RATE SHITHEAD INCOMPETENT CLOWN!

A rage of flame! The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow fury, eight feet high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men, BURNERS, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear, laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing. With effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly consumed. Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN, seven feet high, looming in the shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace. It's overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's ROMERO's dead body. They haul it out of the bin and let it flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BURNERS stare at the body, exchange a blank look through their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward the flames.

INT. REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM/CLOSE BY

In the near darkness, the faintest flickering light reveals two tangled BODIES, motionless in the confusion of refuse. But not quite motionless! A hand opens and closes! A bloody hand! Fingers twitch.

INT. FURNACE ROOM

<DIRECTION>
ROARING FLAMES as ROMERO's body is tossed unceremoniously into the fire where the flames begin to consume it.

For half a second the BURNERS watch ROMERO melt into fire, then they turn their backs and head back for another load.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURNERS' hands reach in and haul out another corpse, GOINES, dragging the body right over TODD's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As GOINES' shoe drags over TODD's face, TODD's eyes flicker stupidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then GOINES' corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin.

TODD blinks, fighting for consciousness. Where is he? He moves his head...

The BURNERS, silhouetted by flames, feed GOINES' body to the furnace.

CLOSE ON THE FLAMES as GOINES' body is consumed by raging flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE BURNERS trudging to the bin. They reach in blindly for whatever's next. Tugging with effort, they struggle the clumsy object over the rim, and let it fall to the floor. It's a mattress!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Communicating with a look, the FIRST BURNER drags the mattress toward the fire while the SECOND BURNER reaches again into the bin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SECOND BURNER frowns through the visor, struggles with something, frowns, wrestles with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, with great effort, he pulls out a big carton that immediately spills old magazines on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disgusted, he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse- littered floor toward the furnaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HIS FEET, as the SECOND BURNER struggles toward the fire, stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable in the flickering firelight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it. The sign says NONFLAMMABLE WASTE DISPOSAL...and the trail of blood leads to that bin!

EXT. OUTER SPACE - "DAY"

Silence! A vast darkness with only a few tiny lights in the infinite depths.

A battered rusty spaceship glides slowly and silently into view. This is a GARBAGE SHIP and it looks it. Awkward and slow and totally unglamorous, it moves through space like a great clumsy church made of steel as we...

<DIRECTION>
As the massive doors on the underside of the ship open, light spills in and there is a huge ROAR as tons of debris, including massive pieces of machinery, huge statues, old vehicles, and numerous containers, spill out through the open bays and tumble downward. The one that says "Nonflammable Waste" on the side careens against the bulkhead with a THUNDEROUS sound, then hurtles downward.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. JUNK MOUNTAINS/LANDSCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As debris from the ship tumbles down onto one of several huge mountains of junk that loom 800 hundred feet above a windswept terrain dimly lit by four pale suns, the bays close, and the rusty GARBAGE SHIP glides away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still the cascade of machines and other bulky junk THUNDERS down the steep slopes, shattering, breaking into parts, tumbling and tumbling, settling here and there, while a SCREAMING WIND, very powerful, picks off the lighter pieces and carries them off like snow blowing off a mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The familiar-looking container somersaults halfway down the slope where it bursts open, spilling a confusion of junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the container, a huge drum smashes into a hunk of machinery and splits, oozing an awful looking liquid that spills down onto the contents of the container, sizzling and smoking on steel, eating it like acid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not far from a smoking piece of steel, WE FIND TODD'S foot protruding from the junk heap! It's motionless! Acid drips and hisses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, sprawled "inside" the mountain of junk, grimacing in pain as acid hits his exposed foot. Trapped in the debris, battered and bloody and weak, he struggles to rise, fights the heavy objects pinning him, fights to avoid the dripping acid. As the wind SCREAMS furiously, he continues to struggle against the junk that pins him as we...

TODD's head, caked with blood, appears from the junk like a man looking out of a cave. Wind seizes at his hair furiously.

He looks up, sees four pale suns in the sky...just as a huge steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose boulder, and TODD has to duck hastily to avoid certain death.

As the heavy steel tumbles down the slope below him, wind plucks a twelve-foot I-beam from the slope next to him and whips it off in a frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding on for dear life, TODD looks down at the ground four hundred feet below and sees a bleak wasteland strewn with junk shifting and skittering in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices something and reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of lines...and moving along one of the lines are four tiny FIGURES...they could be humans...but maybe not!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment TODD watches them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he starts to climb downward through the labyrinth of junk "inside" the mountain, and we...

EXT. LOWER ON "JUNK MOUNTAIN" - DAY - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far down the slope, perhaps forty feet from the foot of the massive mountain, TODD's head pokes out of the confusion of junk and he looks down at the FIGURES below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen more closely, the FIGURES are more distinct, but no less mysterious. Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape, apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like "roads" through the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD watches as one of the FIGURES moves off the "road." He's trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles through the wind, walking almost on all fours like an ape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD watches the FIGURE moving among bits of junk until he locates something he wants, picks it up, and starts to struggle back toward the others, dragging his burden after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging process by these strange unearthly FIGURES as we...

EXT. LANDSCAPE AND "JUNK MOUNTAIN" - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along a cable, headed away from the junk mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of its great bulk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of "his" mountain. The cable is twenty yards away in a "canyon" of junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed to the wind in order to get to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts out from behind the transformer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOOOO! Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet, his arms flailing. He comes down even further from the cable, struggling to keep on his feet. Gritting his teeth, he fights the wind, struggles toward the cable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time as it whistles close to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl "under the wind," toward the taut cable, and we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "STEEL HENGE" - DUSK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing in the distance and the dusk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him, vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must have crashed long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him. He's come a long way, it's almost dark, he's weak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steel crosses. Maybe a hundred of them. A cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire and get weakly to his feet. For a moment he looks like he might collapse, but he doesn't, and we...

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind, struggling along the wire, shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing something ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance a faint light glows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD considers it as we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded in a low mound of "earth" like a skylight. Whatever is making the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only inches above the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange window. He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind. He crawls ten yards to the window and pears through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen through the thick scratched plexiglass window. The wild blurs of activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, prone on the "roof," mystified. He's never seen anything like it. His grease-covered face barely reveals his puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first arrived has diminished to a strong breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD tries sitting up. The breeze doesn't overpower him. He looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on the other window/skylight that glows from this strange "roof" and on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze... a MUSICAL sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next window. The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S POV through the second "window," another mysterious vision! The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is just as puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ. In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof. Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way past a smoking chimney toward the next window. Halfway there he freezes...listening!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows. There's nothing visible...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly TODD understands, but he's too late...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOOOOOOOOOAAR! It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more powerful than ever!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind, struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed violently, somersaulted helplessly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE A TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! TODD is slammed face first to the ground. For a long moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons that aren't clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him from the wind howling overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and injured even to crawl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoes! Less than a foot from his bloody face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He manages to lift his head a little and look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and JOHNNY, eight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in amazement. Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we...

INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOICES, CONFUSION. About fifty people are jammed into the low- ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once. They are PIONEERS, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy, weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines, the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet around the eyes from squinting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman, HAWKINS, is standing behind a table in the front of the room, calling for order.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! Quiet, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named SLADE bellows loudly at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me one thing! How many of them are there and are they armed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLADE>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS stares SLADE down, refusing to speak until she has real silence. When she finally speaks, her voice is calm and controlled.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There in a man...one man. He was found in the trench by several children...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden murmur dies away quickly under HAWKINS' hard stare.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man was not armed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named ELISE speaks over the hum of voices...
</DIRECTION>
<ELISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could there only be one? How could he get here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELISE>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS glances toward MACE, a muscular, bearded man, about thirty.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was unconscious. We couldn't ask him anything. He --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
A commotion in the back room causes MACE to break off as JIMMY PIG, a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes his way in, followed by four more PIONEERS. All five of then are wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange Eskimo-type wind goggles, and carrying weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_PIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothin' out there. We couldn't see nobody, couldn't see no ship, no vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's up again real strong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_PIG>
<DIRECTION>
An excited hubbub. HAWKINS is trying to restore order when SLADE shouts over the commotion.
</DIRECTION>
<SLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're hiding, I bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLADE>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS ignores him as she speaks with firm authority.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's everybody calm down right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; silence; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have an injured man among us. One man. A traveler. Unarmed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(another pause; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all want to do the decent thing. The decent thing is to help him. Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking after him now. Now, I'd like a vote of support on this course of action from all of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
The way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and, in fact, PIONEERS are exchanging glances and nodding when SLADE shouts again.
</DIRECTION>

	You keep an eye on him, Mace! You watch him!

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom. He stares stupidly at the woman bending over him. She is SANDRA, a woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous way. It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and dignity. She's wiping away blood and grease from TODD's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a window high on one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned material hung here and there for decoration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't see the look in SANDRA's eyes as she discovers the savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his cheek. Eyeing these telltale marks, SANDRA pours liquid into a spoon and holds it to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to try some more of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
TODD swallows weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA smiles, stands up, moves toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You rest now. I'll give you more later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
TODD watches her exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears her VOICE in the next room...a low murmur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's looking around again when a NOISE makes him look back toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees. The baby boy, NATHAN, stops just inside, seeing TODD in the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN looks into TODD's eyes with childlike interest and wonder. TODD meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes.

INT. "LIVING ROOM"

A second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the Mace/Sandra/Nathan living quarters. MACE and SANDRA are deep in conversation.

	What do you mean he's survived worse? Did he say something?

	No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars. Knife scars, bullet scars, burns.

MACE is looking around. He spots the open door to the bedroom, hurries to it, and disappears.

SANDRA starts after him, looking worried...but before she gets to the door, MACE reappears with NATHAN safely in his arms.

EXPLOSION! SCREAMS! SMOKE! A SIREN! We're in some kind of war ship in outer space during a battle.
</DIRECTION>

The interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine, cramped even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are awful as SOLDIERS in bulky space suits stumble through thick smoke while a SIREN WHOOPS urgently and wounded SOLDIERS scream in agony.

WHOOOOM! Another EXPLOSION! SCREAMING METAL!

Part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind, ripping SOLDIERS out of the hole into space..

We FOCUS ON a soldier in a space suit who's wedged himself behind a cannon. As we look closely at his visor, we recognize TODD who's firing back at the enemy while all around him SOLDIERS are screaming and dying as we...

It's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can hear SOUNDS...LAUGHTER...coming from beyond the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OTHER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN is wobbling forward with wide eyes as MACE holds one of his hands and SANDRA holds the other. They're teaching the child to walk, encouraging each step. But when they let go, NATHAN totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass. MACE and SANDRA laugh, making the whole thing a game, and NATHAN, after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter. It's a warm moment until SANDRA, sensing a presence, turns toward the bedroom, suddenly serious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACE follows her look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg heavily bandaged.

	You must be...you must be feeling better.

MACE is watching TODD sharply.

	We're teaching the boy to walk.

(nervously filling silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's late learning. He was sick for a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
TODD says nothing. His eyes follow MACE who's gone to the corner where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD tenses. Ready. Dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MACE turns toward him, MACE doesn't notice the danger in TODD'S eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got something for you.

He innocently approaches with the metal rod.

Super alert, TODD watches MACE hold the rod out to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks mistrustful.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
MACE demonstrates, using the rod like a cane.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Expressionless, watches MACE use the cane.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Practice with it. In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra.

INT. OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD's heavy boots come close to NATHAN, the cane clumps down, just missing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder at TODD who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help of a cane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks down at NATHAN. Their eyes meet for a moment. TODD is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA answers a KNOCK at the door, opens it, revealing ELLEN, the ten-year-old, in the doorway. Behind her are JOHNNY and WILL, as well as several other CHILDREN of various ages.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came for Nathan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
But ELLEN's eyes are on TODD and so are the others crowding behind her to peep over her shoulder. They all want to get a look at TODD, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat shyly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA is wearing a parka too. She picks up NATHAN from where he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as ELLEN hugs him and comforts him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and soothe his fears at being separated from his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over- the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the bedroom and heads for the door.

Single-file, a dozen PIONEERS move along a trench as the wind SCREAMS overhead.

We DISCOVER the cane and boots of TODD among them. The MAN in front of TODD glances back at him occasionally, curious, while MACE and SANDRA walk behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass huts, there are windows high in one sloping wall of the trench. TODD doesn't notice the distorted faces of the CHILDREN peering out at him, their noses pressed against the plexiglass, full of curiosity as we...

</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>

	This way...

MACE gives her a wave. He waves at TODD too. TODD looks confused at the wave, then he salutes.

MACE is startled by that. He sort of grins as we...

EXT. GARDEN - DAY - LATER

<DIRECTION>
A nasty little snake, a ten-inch VIPER, slithers through the dirt among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SQUASH! One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel decapitates the VIPER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel clean in the dirt as TODD watches with those blank snake eyes of his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're on all fours in a garden. The garden is simply a much wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated. There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing. Behind them, kneeling PIONEERS are planting new seedlings and weeding around more mature plants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an offhand glance at the dead VIPER.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to watch out for them. They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway. But they'd make you pretty sick. Someone smaller...like me, or a child...

<DIRECTION>
Her meaning clear, SANDRA continues to demonstrate to TODD how to plant the seedling in the earth.

	In a month this one will be as big as those.

TODD follows her look to the other side of the trench where the plants are already eighteen inches high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other PIONEERS, working on their hands and knees also, are sneaking glances as TODD, among them, a middle-aged woman named JUDITH and an older woman, EMMA.

SANDRA frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects another seedling from a tray and hands it to TODD.

<SLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't talk to a soldier no more than you can talk to a...a...bomb! Or a bullet! They're trained, they're killing machines. They got an objective and they go after that objective and nothing stops them but killing them.

The conversation gets the attention of JOHNNY and WILL who stop food-fighting to listen to the adults talk.
</DIRECTION>
<SLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First off, if there's one, there's more. That's how it is, soldiers travel in bunches. Second, they don't waste soldiers on folks like us, that's for police! Training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call "cost effective."

ANGLE ON THE NEXT TABLE where TODD, wedged between SANDRA and MACE, is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as people jabber all around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JUDITH whispering to EMMA at a nearby table as she watches TODD eat.

<SLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see how you can not remember how you got here, Sergeant.

</SLADE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few urgent whispers and a cough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks up from his food and meets SLADE'S look.

SANDRA scowls at SLADE as SLADE persists...

<SLADE>

	You're not a deserter, are you... Sergeant?

The silence is even more charged than before.

SANDRA looks alarmed. Someone coughs. The tension is unbearable.

A sigh of relief from everybody! But SLADE presses on.

EXT. GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little seedling is fitted into the earth gently. TODD's strong hands pat the earth around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD reaches for another seedling. He's one of a group of ten PIONEERS, all on their hands and knees, all working intently, silently. They seem to have accepted him. Nobody stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when something causes him to look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five ENEMY SOLDIERS in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over him, weapons pointed at him. All around them is a desert of sand stretching forever under a baking sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the soldiers kicks TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON EMMA, JUDITH, and several other PIONEER WOMEN exchanging nervous glances as they look back to where TODD's kneeling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are no soldiers...but somehow, he's trampled several rows of seedlings.

TODD looks toward them, confused, disoriented by his "memory."

The women look away quickly, frightened, and we...

INT. OTHER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA is changing NATHAN's diaper as she chatters, her back to TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And it got worse and worse. My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence... political feelings. My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families. That's probably why it broke down... overloaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, TODD, wearing a T-shirt and baggy pants is sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As SANDRA talks, her back to him, TODD's eyes are on the contours of her body against the shift she's wearing. It's very...erotic.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with. It just...dropped. Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind. A lot of people died. And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here. Nobody was happy about it. A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires. But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care. Maybe they think we're garbage too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it. We became a... community.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
As SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN, TODD catches glimpses of her breasts pushing against the material of the shift. She continues, still not noticing where his attention is.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
A wry laugh. She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and catches TODD's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess that's what you like! The fighting, I mean. The wars.

INT. CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY

The CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway, watching something in the meeting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the CHILDREN ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You children are supposed to be doing lessons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWKINS>
<DIRECTION>
The CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them. She looks at what they're looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What they're seeing through the doorway is TODD, shirtless, doing an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises. His muscular body ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of stitches, the puckered patches of burns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of a slow graceful movement, TODD suddenly whirls and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all too obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently, TODD returns to the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that preceded the deadly thrust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHILDREN's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWKINS shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud to the children.

EXT. INSIDE TRENCH - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
It's dark, the wind's HOWLING just above the trench walls as TODD peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S POV THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW reveals a tender moment between MACE and SANDRA as they enter the bedroom and kiss. A flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates their shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as TODD begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze of dark trenches.

EXT. INSIDE A TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MACE continues talking to TODD, he loads the pockets of his heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why we're weighing down. And that's why we're always on the wire even when the wind's down, like now. You don't get much warning. Here, load up, you'll want the weight, I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
MACE hands heavy hunks of metal to TODD who's wearing a parka like MACE'S. He pockets the metal obediently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them a small crowd of PIONEERS are doing the same: JIMMY PIG, SLADE, CHESTER, RED, a woman named SALLY and several OTHERS. In addition to the parkas, they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors and carry canteens, tools, and coils of rope attached to various parts of their outfits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MACE noticing TODD eyeing the rifle JIMMY PIG is carrying.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, we're not going to shoot anything. That's not what we mean by "hunting."

EXT. "STEEL HENGE" - DAY

It's very still, no wind. The little group of PIONEERS is moving along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the wrecked spaceship. They are tiny figures in the vast landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON TODD AND MACE as they plod along in the line of PIONEERS. MACE indicates the wreck off to the right.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sandra said she told you how we wound up here. Our parents and so on.

<DIRECTION>
(turning left, indicating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here, we call these "catcher trenches."

TODD follows his look to a long open trench leading, apparently, nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smaller stuff that blows across the ground, it falls in these trenches, it works sort of like a filter. We go through the trenches sometimes and get some good stuff.

</MACE>

As they pass close along the trench, TODD looks in and observes the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts and assorted junk protruding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACE chuckles at the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We try to work 'em when they're dry. It's lousy going in there when they're flooded. You can see...

A sudden SHOUT, "HEYYUP! YO!" distracts them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks forward, sees RED pointing to a chunk of steel a hundred yards off the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG, already fastening his safety rope and a second rope to the wire, then heading off toward the piece of steel, trailing the two ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MACE, explaining the procedure to TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever looks useful, if we can get a rope to it, we'll go for it. But you can't ever go further than your safety line because it'll come up on you with sometimes maybe ten seconds or even less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is watching JIMMY PIG as he approaches the piece of steel and starts to attach his rope to it.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like right now. You hear that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
TODD listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing at first...then a very faint WHISTLING. The sound he heard that first night when he was on the settlement "roof."
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's close when you hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
TODD can see JIMMY PIG. He's attached the rope to the steel and he gives a signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As PIONEERS start to haul on the line, pulling the steel toward them, MACE shouts at JIMMY PIG.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHE'S GONNA BLOW, JIMMY.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY waves, starts back toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACE indicates for TODD to help haul the steel and the two of them are just joining in the effort when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOOOOOOOO! THE WIND IS SUDDEN AND FEROCIOUS! IT STAGGERS THEM!
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GRAB ON, SERGEANT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
TODD follows MACE'S example and, like the others, grabs the wire and hangs on as the wind SCREAMS and tears at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the pioneers, CHESTER, shouts, points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all see JIMMY PIG being blown faster than he can run, his legs churning desperately to keep up with his wind-propelled body. To no avail! He's suddenly airborne, his legs still churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of his safety tether like a kite, fifty feet in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past, tumbling in the wind. Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, crouched low on their knees against the wind, clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on JIMMY PIG'S safety line. But the wind is too strong...until suddenly TODD is pulling, and TODD'S strength makes the difference... slowly JIMMY PIG is pulled toward them...and Pioneers exchange amazed glances at TODD'S strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls, TODD notices what the others don't...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE RIFLE dropped by JIMMY PIG, ten yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG as he's hauled safely in to the group of PIONEERS who clap him on the back and hug him. CHESTER is laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe and mimic JIMMY'S desperate effort to outrun the force of the wind...

<DIRECTION>
CHESTER breaks off, suddenly sober, staring off, and the others turn to see what he's looking at. Everybody stops laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve the rifle!!! The WIND is dropping off some, enough to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MACE and the other PIONEERS reacting with alarm at the sight of TODD picking up the rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD as he turns, rifle in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S POV of the PIONEERS staring at him, the WIND diminishing further.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD looking toward them. Nothing shows on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour. Trouble! Just what he expected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MACE, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward TODD, holding out his free hand for the rifle...
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, thanks, Sergeant. Thanks a lot...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
But MACE breaks off, realizing that TODD'S attention is elsewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODD'S looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE "JUNK MOUNTAINS" in the distance, several miles off, where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient DUMPER SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the junk heaps far below. The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON TODD, as realizes how he got here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MACE, reacting to TODD'S intense interest.
</DIRECTION>
<MACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dumpers. They come every twenty or thirty days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACE>
<DIRECTION>
As TODD turns and looks at MACE, MACE puts out his hand again for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time. Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to MACE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MACE casually takes the weapon, the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of relief, grinning again as the tension eases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP, fascinated. So that's what they did to him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY_PIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, partner. These no-goods woulda just let me blow away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY_PIG>
<DIRECTION>
TODD, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at JIMMY PIG like what was that? Are you hitting me?

But all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an attack.

A CHRISTMAS TREE! The corny little tree with plastic needles, blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a foot high. It's sitting on CHURCH's cluttered desk next to framed photographs of CHURCH's wife and children. We can hear MEKUM's voice badly transmitted...

Glowering at the monitor where MEKUM's badly transmitted VIDEO IMAGE is quivering and distorting, CHURCH waves the print-out map he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space. RUBRICK and SLOAN watch as CHURCH addresses MEKUM's image indignantly.

	Well, no one's out there, but officially these are "hostile zones." Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as "hostile," I think. But I repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action. Any other questions before I go?

CHURCH hesitates. SLOAN and RUBRICK look at him. Then CHURCH blurts a question, his voice breaking...

MEKUM'S IMAGE disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving a glum silence broken only by the DRUMMING of the rain on the roof.

INT. PIONEER MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE ALL THE WAY." In sharp contrast to the gloom of the soldier Christmas, the PIONEERS, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, are SINGING and celebrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a six-foot carved wooden tree festooned with makeshift decorations and ringed with heaps of presents in crude wrapping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an appetizing looking buffet and a punchbowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD seated against a wall not far from the door. He stares uncomprehendingly at the merriment all around him. What on earth is going on? What are they doing?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY PIG is marching around in a Santa Claus costume, doling out presents to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY and OTHER CHILDREN.

Passing TODD, JIMMY PIG acknowledges him with a wink and a special "HO HO HO."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S eyes give away his confusion. What the fuck is this? JIMMY PIG in a fake beard and a fake stomach? This is the craziest shit TODD has ever encountered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NATHAN, a wrapped present in hand. He hasn't a clue what it is or what he should do with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laughing, MACE and SANDRA hover over him, showing him how to pull the wrapping off. Great idea! NATHAN likes pulling wrapping off! That's fun. SANDRA and MACE watch joyfully as NATHAN tears at the wrapping enthusiastically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD getting to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NATHAN pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a pull toy, a METAL BIRD on crude wheels made of wire and junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACE takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it. The wings flap as the wheels turn!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN reacts with delight and amazement! Then grabs it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUDDEN SCREECH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD looking alarmed. He's on his way to the door, but EMMA is charging at him, SHRIEKING!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not sure whether this is an attack or not, TODD watches the older woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still SHRIEKING giddily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TODD eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a peck on the cheek and points over head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it that says "MISTLETOE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Means nothing to TODD. There's a burst of applause as EMMA scrambles off the stool. Somebody starts to sing "GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MONTAGE OF FACES: JIMMY "SANTA" PIG, MACE, SANDRA, RED, CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING.

A low wind MOANS and mingles with strains of "OH, HOLY NIGHT" as TODD bellies up to the "skylight" and peers down at the scene below in the Meeting Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S POV THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT. The merriment has evolved into a more spiritual mood as the PIONEERS join in the solemn hymn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But TODD spots NATHAN trying to pull his pull toy along so the wings flap. NATHAN is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately SANDRA disengages from the adults and rushes to the sobbing NATHAN and clutches him to her breast, soothing him...and MACE joins her, hovering over his son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD, watching. After a moment, TODD scrambles off the roof and drops into the adjoining trench while "OH, HOLY NIGHT" continues to blend with the soughing WIND.

Lit by spill from a window in the wall of the trench, TODD starts doing push-ups. One-two-three-four-five-six-fast-fast-fast-fast.

HAWKINS is walking along the corridor outside the meeting room when she hears strange SOUNDS. She approaches the door and looks in.

ELLEN and other CHILDREN (including NATHAN) are playing children's games on the floor, paying no attention to the source of the strange noises...JOHNNY and WILL.

<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY and WILL are doing exercises, obviously inspired by TODD's martial calisthenics, and including the sudden violent movements.

NATHAN is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs.

	It seemed like he was never going to walk. Then all of a sudden...he's an expert.

TODD watches SANDRA go to NATHAN and hug him affectionately.

Turning back to the vegetables, stone faced, TODD cuts his finger. Blood flows. He ignores it, continues working...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But SANDRA, returning to the vegetables, notices TODD's cut finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks startled is she takes his finger. Then, staunching the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious.

	Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier?

	What about feelings then? You must have feelings. You must feel something.

A terrified LITTLE GIRL, separated from her family, seeks shelter in a doorway when suddenly she's confronted by THREE SOLDIERS IN RED UNIFORMS looming over her.

<DIRECTION>
Looking up in abject horror, she sees a RED SOLDIER casually pan his assault rifle, pointing the muzzle right at her from only a foot away, unmistakably flexing to fire.

BLAM! Suddenly the RED SOLDIER is blown backwards violently, shot in the chest.

ANGLE ON TODD, visored, in a torn black uniform, firing again.

BLAM! A SECOND RED SOLDIER goes down.

As the LITTLE GIRL, amazed to be alive, watches open mouthed, TODD swings his weapon like a club, attacking the THIRD RED SOLDIER before he can aim.

Then she runs, leaving TODD savagely beating the THIRD RED SOLDIER to death.

TODD blinks. He sees he's got a terrified JIMMY PIG pinned to the wall, his feet dangling two feet off the floor. Slowly he lowers JIMMY PIG to the floor.

It's only now, as he gets to his feet, suddenly trading vicious blows with the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD that we realize that this passive boy is FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD. The boys don't fight like children; they don't quit or cry as the blood flows.

They're all alone in the room. It's very quiet.

NATHAN smiles a tentative smile, raises a hand, reaches out to touch TODD'S face affectionately, curiously, testing their friendship... ANGLE ON TODD, his eyes. Dangerous. He draws his face back enough to avoid being touched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN looks unsure. He's used to affection. Then he realizes... it must be a game! He reaches out again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game.
</DIRECTION>

TODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN.

NATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift. He's pleased. It's that kind of game! He gives TODD a friendly "thanks for the boot" smile.

TODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now.

NATHAN looks at the VIPER. He doesn't understand what he's supposed to do.

TODD makes a hitting motion with his hand.

The VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling.

NATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD.

<DIRECTION>
TODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes. His look is intense, a message in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIPER is like a spring, it strikes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the snake and flips it a couple of feet.

NATHAN stares.

<DIRECTION>
The angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again.

<DIRECTION>
NATHAN looks at TODD.

TODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes.

NATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIPER is about to strike again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SQUASH! A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down for NATHAN. As MACE hugs the boy protectively to his chest, he glares down at TODD with eyes blazing with fury.

As she speaks, TODD's blank stare considers the weathered faces of the PIONEERS facing him. He sees CHESTER, EVA, RED with his WIFE, JIMMY PIG and his WIFE, SLADE and MRS. SLADE, JUDITH, EMMA, SALLY. As HAWKINS continues, TODD's sharp eyes pick out details. He sees JIMMY PIG opening and closing his hands nervously, he sees SLADE fingering a barely noticeable rifle barrel. CHESTER has a weapon too.

The PIONEERS are nervous, ready for trouble, afraid TODD might take this badly and fly off the handle.

As TODD's huge hand opens...and closes, their eyes are on it. He could pick up the table and hurl it at them, break men in half with his bare hands. His face is like stone, his eyes like diamond chips as he glances toward SANDRA.

TODD sees SANDRA is moved, trying to suppress her emotions, biting her lip, as HAWKINS goes on...

A single tear crawls down one cheek.

TODD looks like a stone statue oozing tears. He reaches up and touches the strange water with his finger, then studies the finger, as though a tear were the most remarkable thing he's ever seen. He cannot remember anything like this; he cannot remember ever having cried.

A SOLDIER is in the corridor, not looking at them, but breaking down a door. They can't go that way!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapped, they turn to see the THIRD SOLDIER almost to the doorway, his flame thrower aimed, his finger on the trigger, and...

A blur! Something lands on the THIRD SOLDIER from above the trench, and the THIRD SOLDIER falls over backwards, slamming hard to the floor of the trench.
</DIRECTION>

But he's a super soldier, so that almost at the same time he hits the ground he's already lunging upward to regain his feet and fight except...

A knife blade rips across his throat, opening it wide in one swift movement, and...

The THIRD SOLDIER's head sags back because not even superman can fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi goggles is...

TODD looming over him with a bloody knife, a face like stone, and fierce soldier's eyes.

Dirt explodes around the door frame as TODD ducks back. Quick as a wink, he yanks a grenade from his utility belt, triggers it, and flips it around the corner as CRACK! a shot rips at his arm.

</DIRECTION>

NATHAN sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, ANGIE, sobbing uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds. SANDRA is trying to help with the bandages and console ANGIE at the same time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people GROAN and children CRY OUT.

NATHAN doesn't understand it, it's confusing. MEN and WOMEN loom past him. He wobbles off down the corridor, toddling away from the sounds of pain.

The burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room, leaving a large open space where TODD, bare-chested, a tourniquet on one arm, is squatting on the floor, skillfully reassembling a stripped rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles, pistols, ammo clips, utility belts, goggles, torn armor vests, boots, grenades, knives, and flashlights he salvaged from the dead soldiers. TODD looks up at NATHAN and their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN recognizes his "friend," tries a tentative little smile. But TODD just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from NATHAN's face. For a long moment they just look each other in the eyes very seriously.

TODD nods, turns back to his arsenal.

SANDRA stands there, hugging NATHAN to her chest, holding her tears in, her lids quivering, fighting to conquer her emotion. After a long, difficult moment, she wins the battle with herself. She looks numb, stunned, but she's not crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD has begun to dress. He straps a sheath knife to one ankle, pulls on boots. Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso, covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and the tourniquet on his arm.

Staring at him with glazed eyes, SANDRA notices a blotch of blood form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet. She speaks numbly.

<DIRECTION>
RILEY sees something, reacts.

<DIRECTION>
He sees seventeen NEW SOLDIERS exiting the ship in the fringe of the work-lights, ominous death machines in their heavy gear and goggles, partly lost in shadows like some vision from hell.

SALLY and RED are guarding a door to the trench when a CLANKING noise in the corridor behind them makes them turn and look. Their jaws go slack with amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clanking toward them is TODD, so armored and laden with fighting gear he looks almost like a medieval knight! He says nothing as he looms closer to then, heading for the door. The two of then shrink hastily out of his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping into the trench, TODD hears the wind SCREAM overhead. He approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and begins to pull himself up into the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he climbs, the SCREAMING wind changes pitch radically, and by the time he bellies over the lip of the trench, the wind is only a breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying, replaced by a terrible stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TODD looks off into the darkness, a voice calls to him from the trench behind biz.

<SANDRA>

	Sergeant Todd...I think they...I think...someone made a serious... mistake.

</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks into her eyes. It is impossible to tell if he knows that she cares about him and that she is blessing him.

After a moment he turns away and lumbers off into the darkness, the CLANKING of his equipment the only sound in the spooky stillness.

Two CRAWLERS cut through the night fifty yards apart.

The LEFT FRONT SOLDIER sits on the fender seat of CRAWLER ONE, peering along the beam of his spotlight, scrutinizing the sinister shapes in the darkness, when...

Seven of the NEW SOLDIERS -- the three hanging on CRAWLER ONE and the four from CRAWLER TWO -- drop off into the stillness. One checks the LEFT FRONT SOLDIER's body while the others, barely visible in the weak light, fan out, keeping low, taking cover in the random junk strewn all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE, a corporal, crouched behind a huge piece of discarded agriculture machinery. He yanks a flare from his waist band and fires it.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE peering out into the stillness, then signaling NEW SOLDIER TWO who's hiding nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the two NEW SOLDIERS step out from their sheltered positions, they're joined by NEW SOLDIER THREE. Exchanging hand signals, the three of them advance, spreading out cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW SOLDIER THREE has moved about thirty yards away when suddenly he "disappears."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE A "CATCM TRENCH"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH! SOLDIER THREE has tumbled into a flooded trench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is. He pulls a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in water and littered with rusting junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW SOLDIER THREE splashes along the trench, looking for a way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the trench, a perfect ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his beam down the trench behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW SOLDIER THREE'S POV of the flooded trench. Junk and water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER THREE, turning back and approaching the ladder. Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again his light illuminates the spooky trench. Again, nothing but water and junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him. EXT. JUNK TERRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE stiffens. Was that a stifled CRY? Or not?

<DIRECTION>
NEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE THE TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant. TODD is hastily rummaging through the soldier's equipment, looking for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNK TERRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly a flare bursts above them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them in a brightly illuminated landscape. Before they can take cover...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA. Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing on the ground, SCREAMING.

ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench, accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS....

CLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid! The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and diminishes backward like a man pissing...

<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE THE TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench, sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries to scale the steep wall of the trench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOOOOOOOSH! The surface of the water-filled trench bursts into flame. A fiery river of flammable liquid.
</DIRECTION>

NEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS communicating by hand signals as they move to surround TODD.

TODD'S POV of the terrain. Vague glimpses of NEW SOLDIERS slipping from cover to cover, never exposing themselves enough for a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD. He seems to know he's in a tight spot. He's preparing to fight off an attack, laying out weapons, grenades, when...he freezes. Listens.

Behind the stillness he can hear the faint WHISTLE that precedes the wind.

Hastily TODD yanks his belt off.

The WIND SIGHS and a faint breeze stirs. Then a tin can skitters by in a puff of wind as the NEW SOLDIERS take turns moving closer to TODD, flanking him from safe vantage points.

NEW SOLDIER FOUR stands to wave the next man forward when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH! THE WIND ERUPTS, ROARS, BELLOWS...
</DIRECTION>

NEW SOLDIER FOUR is lifted into the air and carried away.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As NEW SOLDIER SIX disappears, blown off into the night, NEW SOLDIER SEVEN manages to grab hold of the walking wire.

Gripping the wire for his life, he turns just in time to be decapitated by a piece of aluminum housing flying through the air.

The GUNNER is peering intently through his scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNNER'S POV through his scope: The infrared view with crosshairs is especially spooky because of the debris blowing eerily across the landscape as the gun whips back and forth, looking vainly for TODD. Suddenly the sight is yanked hard, sweeping violently over to pin a moving object...

False alarm! Just another piece of blowing junk. No sign of TODD.

As shells slam into CRAWLER TWO, the two NEW SOLDIERS outside try to get clear of the explosions, staggering off into the wind.

TODD sets his sights on one of the NEW SOLDIERS, cutting him down with rocket fire, then he glances toward the SECOND NEW SOLDIER on the right.

The SECOND NEW SOLDIER, ten yards ahead, stops, turns to fire.

TODD yanks the wheel, swerving toward him.

CRAWLER ONE plows into the NEW SOLDIER, crushing him under the wheels, and continuing to grind toward the crippled CRAWLER TWO.

WHAM! CRAWLER ONE rams CRAWLER TWO and drives it sideways, pushing it ten yards... twenty yards.... thirty yards...until suddenly it sprawls into the mouth of the trench garden, splintering the trellis and wedging itself at a sharply canted angle over the garden, and we...

a blazing fire, whipped by wind from a shel hole in the ceiling, consuming tables in the far half of the commons...

while JIMMY PIG, SLADE and SANDRA struggle with one end of a huge beam that's fallen at an angle on top of a trap door in the floor, the root cellar.

Limping, TODD keeps his weapon ready as he searches out the sound.

ANGLE ON THE INJURED SOLDIER, the one TODD crushed under the treads of the CRAWLER. He's screaming in pain. Looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looms over the INJURED SOLDIER, weapon pointed. Their eyes meet.

In agony, the SOLDIER looks into TODD'S eyes, nods ever so slightly.

BLAM! BLAM! TODD fires point blank.

Now the only sound is the ROARING of the WIND and the pathetic sound of RUBRICK continuing his desperate RADIO BABBLE.

The gap between the floor and the trap door has increased to ten inches, enough for EMMA and RUTH to squeeze an INFANT through to SANDRA'S reaching arms.

Soaked with sweat, gasping and coughing in the thickening smoke, JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED continue to strain at the beam...and it moves. Another inch!

RED rushes through a smoky corridor. Wherever shells have punctured the roof, the WIND whips debris about.

EXT. INSIDE THE GARDEN TRENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting up now, using a flashlight, CAINE 607 is examining a terrible gash in his thigh that reveals tissue and tendon. The right side of his face is also badly injured, flesh torn, swollen and distorted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the first aid kit from his utility belt, opens it, focuses the light on the contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selects a couple of pills. Swallows them. Considers. Takes two more. Pulls out a hypodermic needle, injects his leg. Takes another needle, stabs his bloody cheek.

His eyes glitter as he feels the rush from the drug. He looks dangerous again in spite of his condition.

Dragging a freshly bandaged leg, CAINE 607 makes his way along the trench toward the settlement. He's using the wall for support...but he seems to be getting stronger rather than weaker. His face is hideous. INT. JUNCTION OF CORRIDORS

<DIRECTION>
Carrying two axes RED zips around a corner and freezes...

RED'S POV of: A SOLDIER, seen from behind, moving down a smoky corridor, helmeted, heavily armed, dangerous looking, unidentifiable.

RED scoots around another corner and... stops short...an armored torso a foot in front of his face.

<DIRECTION>
Looking up, RED looks right into the distorted face of CAINE 607.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before RED can react, CAINE 607'S hand shoots out and snatches one of the axes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Astonished, RED backs up a step, and raises the other axe to defend himself.

RED'S POV OF CAINE 607 looming toward him, axe in hand.

She puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering CHILD, hushes another.

A timber falls outside the door and SANDRA sees a shadowy shape enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>

Frightened CHILDREN hold their breath, peer out fearfully.

CRACK! SMASH! The huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way, switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness.

The light wipes the damaged room.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CAINE 607 holding the door/shield as he advances on RED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backing, RED trips, goes down flat on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAINE 607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RED shoves the door aside, aims his gun up at CAINE 607, as the huge soldier looms over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before RED can pull the trigger, CAINE 607 snatches the rifle barrel and yanks the weapon out of RED'S hands.
</DIRECTION>

RED rolls, scrambles to his feet.

And CAINE 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle, crushes his skull with three brutal blows.

INT. ROOM

TODD'S impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness he feels at what's happening to him. TOMMY is seated on his shoulders, he's got NATHAN in one arm and JOHNNY is nervously looking up at him as he clutches at TODD'S huge free hand, and now a little girl, SARAH, clutches at his combat pants as SANDRA instructs her.

<SANDRA>

Frightened faces look to the awkward "killing machine."

TODD looks like a statue decorated with CHILDREN.

JOHNNY is sobbing as he hangs onto TODD's giant hand obediently.

SANDRA freezes. TODD is alert, tense...and covered with CHILDREN.

SANDRA turns and runs for the door as TODD starts to put the CHILDREN down. But he's awkward, slow, not his usual graceful self, trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables.

Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her, weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers after her out of the shadows. CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.

TODD is just putting NATHAN gently on the floor when he sees CAINE 607 arrive in the doorway. For halt a second their eyes meet, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAINE 607 advances on TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still encumbered by CHILDREN clutching at him, TODD sees his weapons, but can't get to them. Then it's too late!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The terrified CHILDREN watch as the giant CAINE 607 clubs TODD mercilessly with the rifle butt, then hurls him backwards like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified, SANDRA sees TODD slam into a wall, slump to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dismissing TODD, CAINE 607 turns, looms toward the CHILDREN.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
CAINE 607 ignores her, heads for ELLEN, dragging his bad leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spotting TODD'S weapons, SANDRA snatches a heavy rocket rifle, brings it up awkwardly, points it, FIRES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the kick from the heavy gun sends SANDRA sprawling back, the weapon trembling from her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the WHIZZING ROCKET, a near miss, gets CAINE 607's attention. He turns away from ELLEN, toward SANDRA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD rising to his knees, blinking stupidly, trying to focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD'S POV, a vague, unfocused image of SANDRA, snatching a bayonet from TODD'S gear on the floor and lunging courageously at CAINE 607.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vaguely, TODD sees CAINE 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and grab her. As she beats at CAINE 607 bravely with her fists, the big man slams her into a wall brutally. As she crumples, he hits her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TODD struggling to his feet, staggering as he shakes his head to clear it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes go to SANDRA, slumped against the wall, bloody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified CHILDREN look up at CAINE 607 as he towers over them. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHTUNK! A knife blade suddenly sticks in CAINE 607's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAINE 607 only flinches... and, as he YANKS the knife from his neck by the handle, he turns to see who threw the blade...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! TODD slams into him, tackling him, driving his big shoulder deep into the new soldier's waist, slamming the big man hard into a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Air goes out of CAINE 607, the knife drops from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But that's it for TODD's victory. Six-five, two-sixty, CAINE 607 is bigger and stronger than TODD. His powerful arms rip TODD off him like he's taking off a Band-Aid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified, wide-eyed CHILDREN watch TODD hurled back across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD scrambles to his feet, shakes his head clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here comes CAINE 607, dragging his bad leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD attacks! Combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a vicious kick!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But 607 counters expertly, brushing aside the attack!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD lunges again employing yet another skilled move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMACK! CAINE 607 outmaneuvers TODD again, punishing him brutally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! WHAM! SMASH! CRUNCH! This time TODD jolts the bigger man with a terrible combination of moves, smashing him in the Adam's apple, kicking him in the knee, driving an elbow into the jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time it's CAINE 607 who has to back away to recover. And now he seems to re-consider TODD, revealing for the first time a genuine respect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As their eyes meet, CAINE 607 seems to be saying "All right then, you're serious, let's do it, fella."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD lunges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! CAINE 607 creams him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD twists, slams CAINE 607 back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BASH! A fist to the face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UMMMMMPH! A knee in a groin!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM! A head against a wall!

INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHUMP! TODD's bloodied head is slammed on the floor. His eyes are almost swollen shut as he looks up at CAINE 607 kneeling on top of him. Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath coming in gasps, but it's CAINE 607 who's on top, beating the last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one more time...before he slumps unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified, NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with the last of his strength, "finishing him off." NATHAN can't stand it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He toddles toward CAINE 607, who's still on all fours, and attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's bloody face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHAN's ineffectual blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once standing, he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees. For a moment he's confused. What's this?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself. When he looks down at NATHAN again, tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as dead. One blow and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But just then big hands close around CAINE 607's ankles, tackling him. As the giant topples, TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls on top of the fallen man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CAINE 607 looks up into TODD's fierce face, the fight goes out of his eyes. He knows he's beaten, he knows TODD will never quit. He's helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as TODD puts the pressure on, CAINE 607 whispers...

In the sudden silence as TODD, panting, stares at his defeated enemy, he hears a VOICE...her VOICE...very weak...

<SANDRA>

	Sergeant...

TODD turns and sees SANDRA slumped against the wall where Caine 607 threw her. There's a trickle of blood coming from a nostril, more blood in her hair. Her eyes don't look right.

TODD sees NATHAN looking at his mother with fear in his eyes. Struggling to his feet, TODD picks up NATHAN and puts the boy down close to his mother.

SANDRA reaches out and takes NATHAN's hand. She holds NATHAN's hand toward TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears in SANDRA's eyes as she pushes NATHAN's little hand into TODD's huge left paw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks down at the joined hands, then he looks into SANDRA's flooded eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Does TODD understand her gesture? His face is impassive. Maybe he doesn't. Just then a hand touches his shoulder.

TODD turns to see JOHNNY face him, trembling but valiant, to ask the question the others are fearful of asking.

Exhausted, SLADE lets the door fall back, picks up his rifle and turns toward the exit. And freezes. Dumbfounded.

The four VETERANS axe astonished at what they see.

CRAWLER ONE, battered and motionless, is abandoned only ten yards away.

The flashlight beam probes the blown out windshield, the scarred chassis, pans across the back seat...and pans back urgently, glimpsing tiny EYES.

The EYES disappear behind the back seat.

RILEY, CHESLEY, GREEN and MOORE exchange glances.

Out of the darkness beside him, TODD looms.

RILEY looks into the face of a man he saw killed!

TODD has a CHILD in each arm and another hanging on to his leg for dear life. He's wearing the scarf Jimmy Pig gave him.

	This is important for all of us, for our careers. There's going to be a Board of Inquiry and --

<DIRECTION>
MEKUM'S IMAGE cuts out mid-babble.
</DIRECTION>
<SLADE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the boss, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLADE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
TODD and RILEY turn to see SLADE in the entrance to the cockpit addressing TODD and the VETERANS collectively.
</DIRECTION>
<SLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, I guess you fellas are all right. I guess I misjudged you some. Where I said you were "a buncha no good killer robots," I mighta just overspoke myself. As of now, till it goes otherwise, you got my sincere approval and support.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLADE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, SLADE turns and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks at RILEY, RILEY looks at TODD. What the fuck was that?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/"DADDY" - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself on a wall, keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a doorway, peers in, sees two SOLDIERS working at a console like robots. They don't look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COCKPIT/"DADDY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Entering, NATHAN moves among the legs of big men, VETERANS. NATHAN keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, backing against a wall, he looks up and VETERANS loom past him with blank faces. He is alone again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN totters onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS, the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve, showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD and RILEY are poring over them, their eyes considering dot after dot. Finally, TODD points to a dot and looks a question at RILEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY considers the dot for a long moment...then he looks TODD in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<RILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RILEY>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks back at the dot, considers it, looks back at RILEY.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Air?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY nods a yes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD is thoughtful...finally asks the next question.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RILEY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding yes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But very cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RILEY>
<DIRECTION>
TODD considers the dot on the map again, then looks at RILEY.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<RILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, aye, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RILEY>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY turns toward a console, but something makes him look down toward his feat. Then he looks back at TODD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD follows the look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD who's towering over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD looks down without expression, the scarf from Jimmy Pig still wrapped around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD considers the outstretched arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD. What's this?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD hesitates a half second more, then leans down and picks NATHAN up in his arms, lifting the boy to his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY looks on. Never seen anything like it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN is close to TODD's face, looking right into it, trying a little smile, a nervous one, looking for a response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD hesitates, takes a breath, moves the muscles of his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All he can produce is an awkward grimace, the distortion of a smile, almost comical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN reads the intention successfully. His face collapses into a huge friendly grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD tries again, making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY watches. Totally amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD turns, takes NATHAN to a porthole, puts his face up to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars, a sky full of hope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As NATHAN looks out, TODD works his face again, trying for a smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN looks at the stars outside, TODD looks with him and suddenly TODD's face relaxes into an awkward grin, almost by accident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RILEY watches the two of them for a moment, confounded by what he's seeing. Then he turns to the console and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLOSING CREDITS ROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
