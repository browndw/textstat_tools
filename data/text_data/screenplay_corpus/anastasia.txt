INT. PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an ORCHESTRA plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase. Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well, all her daughters except. . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a SERVENT (SONYA) 16, who is trying to catch up with Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.
</DIRECTION>
<SONYA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my fault!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONYA>
<ANASTASIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . .
	</DIALOGUE>

Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping Anastasia with a

<ANASTASIA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . owwwwwwwww!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANASTASIA>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music suddenly becomes a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS. SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a proccession through their subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA" (OPENING NUMBER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the pride of all Russia". Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a shock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his eyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still waltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the room carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The guests "Ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasia sees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a dance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tosses it to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from under the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls Dmitri into an open wall panel.
</DIRECTION>
<IVAR>

(angrily)

<DIRECTION>
RULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from his hiding place under the table and back to the kitchen. It's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICAL CONFUSION. The servants sing about their demanding employers and mockingly imitate their behavior: they imply that they have their own "party", that change is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While back in the ballroom, the Royalists are oblivious to the servants discontent and sing their satisfaction with their own lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following scenes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TATIANA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious and very regal. She slides over to make room for Anastasia who sits next to her.

Anastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with pride. Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain.

<TATIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATIANA>

Tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a beautiful MUSIC BOX. Tatiana takes the key, a small silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and winds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>

Tatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and they embrace. Then, suddenly . . .

ON THE GRAND CHANDELIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the lights begin to fade in and out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUP SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then, a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance floor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springs out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke - leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the floor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over other men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes - which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He is dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope tied around his waist. Connected to the rope is a glowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern.

Twirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder as Bartok circles around his head. The smoke that emerges seems to have almosy a human shape to it.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV LINE - FOREVER !!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
The tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into a frenzy and then EXPLODING.

<DIRECTION>
The smoke clears and Rasputin is gone. As the lights return to normal the Romanov family all stand together, and try to look regal and in control once again.

EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots. The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half, sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift. From the depths of the snow we HEAR her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the horizon. Anya stands at edge of the hill, looking down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray orphanage looms behind her. Anya "borrows" an old, beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises and St. Petersburg looms nearer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE. Anya SINGS - - full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her rickety bike toward the city. "Her heart is on its way" and nothing is going to stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya passes though the countryside toward the city. A peasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very fancy car zooms by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from a peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long as she finds her real family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People stare at her as she rides into the edge of the city. She is captivated by all the activity: cars, busses, stores, long lines of people, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be someone who has a clue to her identity. She'll stop at nothing to find the someone who once loved her. SOARING MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION. END MUSICAL NUMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meetoo is trapped. The PACK surrounds him, ready to pounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle. The PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya and Meetoo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya doesn't know what to do. She crouches and then. . . growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious as possible. The PACK exchange a confused look; there's a girl growling at them. Meetoo stands, suddenly brave, behind her and growls along with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder. The pack has definately had enough - some start to back out quizzically, others turn and run like hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully, wagging his tail. Anya picks up the bone and puts it back in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should be more careful about who you invite to dinner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
Meetoo nods and lets out a little "bark" that sounds as if he were saying "retu". Anya pats him and heads back to her bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya rides down the street. She doesn't see Meetoo, running like a little maniac behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign over the door: "The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leaps off her bike and heads up the stais. Meetoo, breathing heavily from his run, follows and almost reaches her when the heavy door slams in his face. He slumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya enters and STOPS when she sees. . . LINES and LINES of people which seem to go on forever. She walks down the side of one line, trying to figure out which one to stand in.

as she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air. Her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air. She spins around and sees Serebreakov DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serebreakov is on a mission to find Anya. He turns in her direction just as a bus passes. Anya is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it drives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping - he knows he'll never catch up to her now. Then he sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off into the mud. Happily, Meetoo trots off in her direction.

Anya approaches TWO PEASANTS who are waiting in line in front of a cafe.

They begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers as to wether Dmitri is at the tavern or the library. Exasperated, Anya walks away. They call after her.

Just then, she catches another whiff of something foul in the air. Anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses Meetoo. Anya peeks out. A GARBAGE WAGON full of dead fish and rotten food passes Anya. She sighs with relief, it wasn't Serebreakov - it just smelled like him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya steps out of the doorway and approaches a STREET ARTIST sketching a LARGE PEASANT WOMAN as her TINY HUSBAND looks over his shoulder.

Anyone from a peasant to a princess will do, as long as she can fool Tatiana. (NOTE: We don't want to give Dmitri a whole new song here or we'll be too song-heavy in Act I. By giving him a short reprise of Anya's song, we can effectively align these two characters emotionally.)

"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE: (MOS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole against a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya - she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her covers and she SLUGS him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo grabs them in his mouth and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement. Anya turns to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him with great vindication.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks him with her head accidently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together, with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither of them even try to readjust.

Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day. She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she HEARS A GROWL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees. (All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT resemblance to Rasputin.) Anya is frozen with fear as MORE BEARS emerge and head straight for her. She tries to back away as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape.
</DIRECTION>

It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply and move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes to the safety of a large tree She climbs the tree and escapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy branch, the ground seems miles away.

Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake. She jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED YELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In UPTEMPO "PARIS IN THE TWENTIES style MUSIC, the people of Paris ALL SING, welcoming Anya and Dmitri, Sophie and Vlad, to Paris!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The foursome explores the city and Anya has the happiest day of her young life. On the streets they encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud, Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties.. For those in the audience who don't recognize them, they'll simply be unidentified fascinating "types" who SING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya to a world where she clearly is at home. He SINGS for a short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. Anya visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box for her evening at the ballet. A BIG FINALE as they go off for the evening. Even Meetoo has found some female poodle companionship. But for one last beat, Dmitri's wistfulness cuts against joy.

<DIRECTION>
Anya is asleep as Tatiana kisses her forehead, turns off the light and walks to the door. She looks back on her sleeping granddaughter with enormous joy and gratitude. She smiles to herself as she pulls the door closed behind her, revealing RASPUTIN STANDING BEHIND THE DOOR. His eyes glow like embers in the dark. Bartok is perched on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>

He waves his hand and the smoke emerges, emanating toward the walls.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
some CHERUBS as the smoke hits them. They begin to change, taking on a lean and evil look. Their tiny arrows grow, becoming lethal, as their eyes turn from soft brown to blood red. Slowly, they EMERGE from the wallpaper, their small wings growing into horrible pterodactyl membranous paired appendages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They SWOOP into flight and begin to circle the room, faster and faster. Rasputin leans precariously over the sleeping Anya, chuckling.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there will be no blood on my hands ...

Rasputin backs away as the cherubs aim their JAGGED ARROWS at Anya.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Meetoo leaps up from the bed, barking. Rasputin, startled, jumps backward. Bartok falls off his shoulder and on to the table, knocking into the reliquary - which is about to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooooooo!

Rasputin catches it. The SPELL is immediately broken and everything turns back to normal just as Anya wakes up. She sees Rasputin and lets out a SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin advances on her, his hands outstretched as if to strangle her when he hears footsteps and voices in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin grabs the reliquary and LEAPS out the window, his monk's robe billowing just as the door opens.

She embraces Anya, who is still terrified and knows that she saw what she saw.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TATIANA'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya sits, looking a bit vacant as two overly French jewelers, PIERRE & ANDRE, fit Anya for her ROYAL CROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tatiana sits across from Anya and can't help but notice that Anya looks miserable as Sophie bustles about.
</DIRECTION>
<SOPHIE>

The slight is lost on Sophie who bustles out talking to herself.

</ANDRE>
<PIERRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the crown she is ... how you say?

</PIERRE>
<ANDRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Small! Zat is "how you say" it! Don't be so French, Pierre wit the "how you say" all za time - zat is really annoying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDRE>
<DIRECTION>
As they discuss this, Anya wanders away from them, the crown still slightly askew on her head. Tatiana follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<TATIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are going to make a beautiful princess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
But Anya simply nods. Tatiana turns her towards a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, then straightens the crown as they look at their reflections.
</DIRECTION>
<TATIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lovely...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Tatiana leaves and Vladimir looks at Anya. Anya, angry at him, turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<VLADIMIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anya... Anastasia... I'm sorry ... We didn't mean to hurt you ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VLADIMIR>

Anya still won't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TATIANA'S STUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tatiana walks into her study and is happy to see Dmitri is standing there, looking nervous and very uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<TATIANA>

Dmitri flips his hair out of his eyes and Tatiana gets a look of recognition across her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and I'm going to keep my promise to stay out of your lives, forever.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?

</DMITRI>
<TATIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri comes down the steps, then stops when he sees Anya, wearing her CROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and sees him, stifling her first impulse, then putting on a show of supreme confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you found what you were looking for.

</DMITRI>
<ANYA>

With nothing left to say, he heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy your fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri spins, but restrains. He opens the door and Anya goes back into the Parlor. They both know that they will never see each other again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LITTLE HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri busily tosses his few possessions into his backpack as Vladimir - in formal attire - waves an embossed INVITATION at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VLADIMIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VLADIMIR>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>

Vladimir starts to protest. Dmitri grabs the invitation and tears it up, tossing the pieces into the air. Vladimir sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<VLADIMIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where will you go?

PULL RACK

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DMITRI'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the windows BURST OPEN and Rasputin swoops in. Dmitri backs away, terrified as the ladder dissolves and smoke fills the room.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Rasputin!

</DMITRI>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri backs away as the smoke coils around him and Rasputin advances.
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<RASPUTIN>

<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...

</DMITRI>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.

<DIRECTION>
(Dmitri turns away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
The SMOKE forms into hands, forcing Dmitri's face toward Rasputin's. Dmitri's eyes widen. Rasputin locks on him with his eyes, glowing like red hot coals, as he bears Dmitri in hypnotically.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TATIANA>
<DIRECTION>
Tatiana leaves. Anya is very torn. Anya jumps as the TRUMPETS sound announcing her entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COURTIERS gather, excited, as the Major Domo readies to make his announcement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANTE ROOM (EIFFEL TOWER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya, thinking about what Tatiana has said, looks at herself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANYA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Princess Anastasia. But not Anya.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_DOMO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C) (announcing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her Serene Highness, the Princess Anastasia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR_DOMO>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. WE HEAR mummers from the crowd outside, various "Where's Anastasia?", then
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
Anya spins around, looking for him. His voice seems distant and ghostly,
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anya ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
Anya follows his voice out of the room and into the ELEVATOR. The doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it rises gently to the very top of the Eiffel Tower not on cables - but on long ropes of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF EIFFEL TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin, gleeful, sits perched on a girder, looking down at the party below.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Bartok. Most of them were there the night I made this curse. Now, they'll get to see it finished!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing, content)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Revenge is a dish best served... in front of a larrrrrge audience!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin leans over the rail and looks down at the party.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not despair. I'll make sure your beloved princess drops in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin chuckles at his own "wit"
</DIRECTION>
<BARTOK>
<DIRECTION>
(depressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, very witty. There's this English guy - Noel Coward - I'll bet he's quaking ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTOK>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door open and Anya rushes out, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dmitri?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri is standing - like a zombie - at the far end of the platform. Anya sees him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dmitri ... Grandmama told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. She can tell that something isn't right with Dmitri by the look in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dmitri, what's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri approaches her slowly, zombie-like, arms outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(from above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw her off the edge! Do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anya looks up at the booming voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANYA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees Rasputin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO ANYA: FLASHES, RAPID IMAGES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RASPUTIN from the last night at the palace
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG ANASTASIA - TERRIFIED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ORANGE flash of gunshots
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG DMITRI leading them out the wall panel, then the Face of the YOUNG DMITRI superimposes over the zombie who is coming toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dmitri ... Look at me! It's Anya! It's ANYA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri stops. His eyes glazed and frightening.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved my life in the palace! You won't take it now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(from above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FINISH HER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anya holds her ground as Dmitri moves toward her, ready to push her off the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dmitri. I know you would never hurt me. You love me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
As Dmitri come close, she moves toward him and kisses him. He blinks and snaps out of it and is quite happy that Anya is kissing him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dmitri?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anya... where are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR a howl from above and suddenly Rasputin jumps down. The reliquary tied to his waist, he's more furious than we've ever seen him - his face literally consumed with rage and hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya is terrified - but holds her ground as she did when she was a child.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin walks slowly toward Anya and Dmitri, burning with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Anya - go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not leaving you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fighting for fair lady. How noble...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri pushes Anya away and charges the much larger Rasputin, who knocks his aside with on swoop of big huge arm.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin turns to Anya climbing up a girder.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's only going to make you fall farther.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anya turns suddenly and kicks Rasputin in the face, which has the same effect as kicking a brick wall. Anya is thrown off balance and falls. Rasputin pushes her with his foot and she slides across the floor to Dmitri.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as Rasputin, chuckling, advances on them. Anya reaches up and grabs Rasputin's beard, pulling his face forward so that Dmitri can give him a good roundhouse punch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blow does little but enrage Rasputin. He reaches out and with one huge hand, picks Anya like a rag doll and takes her to the ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri throws himself against Rasputin several times only to get batted away like a fly. Realizing this is futile, Dmitri slips through the FLOOR GIRDERS and scurries towards the edge... BELOW TEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DMITRI POV: Rasputin's large boots above him, heading for the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin reaches the edge, playful dangling the struggling Anya over the side.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My curse is now complete! Good-bye, babushka!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anya looks over the ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANYA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The city below as she FALLS. Dmitri emerges from the grid below and GRASS her, holding on to the back of her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take my hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sees Rasputin approaching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
She manages to spin around, gripping his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let me go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never let go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
their hands, gripping one another.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a touching sentiment...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
They look up to see his right above them. Rasputin's boot SMASHES DOWN on Dmitri's hand, which grips the girder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri screams out in, but doesn't let go. He looks down at Anya and pulls her up while Rasputin begins to pry off Dmitri's fingers one at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This little piggy had a palace... this little piggy had a throne...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anya swings to another beam and now has firm footing as Rasputin continues.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This little piggy missed the firing squad..
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri is literally holding on with two fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this little piggy wanted a home... And this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way... down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
As Dmitri's last finger is preyed away, he falls but his grasp on Anya's hand is firm and she pulls him onto where she is standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rasputin leans over and bends toward them, three feet from Anya.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
The reliquary is dangling. Anya reaches up to grab on to it but her aim is off and she HITS it. The reliquary flies and SMASHES against the side of the tower, shattering. Rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOOOOOOO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASPUTIN>
<DIRECTION>
ON BARTOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who covers his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANYA AND DMITRI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who climb back up to the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the Eiffel Tower as the EVIL SPIRITS FROM THE RELIQUARY burst out. The SPIRITS take on all the forms we've seen earlier: BEARS, MINIONS, SNAKES, and combinations of all. They grow and swirl, with hideous MOANING noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anya and Dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON RASPUTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the SPIRITS begin to swarm around him, a TORNADO of horrid beings. Re screams as they pull him off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ANYA AND DMITRI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the force of the tornado increases, they have to hold on to the girders and each other in order not to be sucked in. Bartok is thrown against the side of the tower and slithers to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON RASPUTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suspended over the Eiffel Tower in the maelstrom. He Screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment him and EXPLODE - pieces fly and disintegrate in mid-air, in wild colors and smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DMITRI AND ANYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who hug each other in relief. They stand, looking out. The smoke dissipates, showing them the city lights below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BARTOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who rises, patting his chest- He's about to let out a Bartokism... but all the emerges are LITTLE BAT SQUEAKS. He's surprised as first, then thrilled. The spell is broken and he's just a bat again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DMITRI AND ANYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he reaches down and picks up the crown that fell off her head in the fight. He hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DMITRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on... I'll take you home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DMITRI>
<DIRECTION>
Anya looks lovingly at Dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.
</DIRECTION>
<ANYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANYA>
<DIRECTION>
"HONE IS WHERE YOU ARE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(The Love Duet For Anya And Dmitri). A SIMPLE EMOTIONAL BALLAD for two people who realize at last that their hearts have led then to each other, to "home". This will work within the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but can also be re-recorded as a Pop single.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song continues over various scenes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EMPTY STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tatiana smiling, knowingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOPHIE & VLADIMIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sneaking a kiss in the middle of the party. Xenia and Estelle look at each other with their stone faces.. . and smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARTOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging from the rafters of the Eiffel Tower, no sure what to do next - then a cute female bat flies up next to his and "bats" her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANYA & DMITRI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking over the River bridge with Meetoo following behind them... a family - going home together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
