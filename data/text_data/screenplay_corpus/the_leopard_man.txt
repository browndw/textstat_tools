On the fountain at El Pueblo. A jet of waiter rises into the air at regular intervals, tossing an empty ball in rhythm. Below the ball, the water cascades into the second tier of the fountain. SUPERIMPOSED over this fountain are the main and credit titles. Throughout the running of the titles we hear castanet music growing louder and louder. When the last credit title FADE OFF we begin to

The corridor, backstage at El Pueblo. An empty corridor stretches away before us. The CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG this corridor. The sound of the castanets is so loud and ringing now that it has a furious and stormlike quality. The camera seems to search for the source of this sound. It approaches two open doorways at the end of the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the doorway on the right we see a dancer in Spanish costume. She pirouettes in a final whirl of the dance as the CAMERA MOVES IN TO a CLOSE SHOT of her beautiful back and the two castanets she holds up over her gleaming naked shoulders. Over the diminishing trill of the castanets, as the dancer finishes her dance we hear a dull and angry pounding. The castanets click to an end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES LEFT to take in the adjoining door to show us the source of this sound.

INT. KIKI WALKER'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiki Walker as she finishes pounding on the wall for silence in the adjoining dressing room and turns back into her own room. She is young, blonde and represents that peculiar phenomenon of our time, the chorus girl and entertainer who is more lady-like than the majority of Junior Leaguers. Road shows, one night stands and even a short turn in burlesque have left no battle scars. She may know many a hard word, but she never uses it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - Kiki's room. Kiki slams shut the door of her dressing room. Her dressing room is a small bare cubicle with a sink, easy chair, dressing table and a long mirror on the closet door. On the dressing table, among a clutter of jars and ointments, is a small musical trinket box. The closet door is partially ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room with Kiki is Eloise, the cigarette girl at the El Pueblo, a brightly blondined young lady. Her nether limbs are well display in black stockings. A cigarette tray is slung over her shoulder.

Kiki walks across to the make-up table and sits down in front of it, lifting her hands to unwrap the towel which is wrapped around her head to protect it from make-up. Eloise starts toward the door, but pauses to admire herself in the mirror,.

Eloise can see what is opening the door. She lets loose with a shriek of mortal terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of Kiki. She whirls quickly and rises, her mouth open in a soundless ejaculation of fright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - the door. Through the doorway comes the black, spade-shaped head of a panther, ears wickedly flat, muzzle to the floor. He starts into the room with a terrifying zigzag undulation. Eloise yips feebly. Kiki screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the panther advances into the room, one can see that it is held on a taut leash. Holding the leash is Jerry Manning, with a wide, pleasant smile of reassurance on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT Kiki on top of the dressing table. She stands there holding her dressing gown back across her knees in terror. The little jewel box has fallen to the floor, and the insipid tinkling tune fills the room as it rolls across the floor toward the panther.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - Kiki, Eloise, Jerry and the panther. Kiki stands on top of the dressing table; Eloise has retreated behind a chair, and Jerry stands between them, grinning, holding the leash of the panther, which is nosing forward to examine the music box

INT. PATIO EL PUEBLO CAPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CL0SE SHOT - the fountain. The CAMERA is FOCUSED on the extreme height of the jet of water. We watch the ball on top of this jet as it rises and falls for a few beats. Over this shot we hear the music of a Mexican orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES DOWN and BACK to reveal the upper tier of the fountain with the water flowing over its edges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES BACK and we see the wide pool at the base of the fountain. In this pool we see Clo-Clo reflected, as she dances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS to take in the actual dancer and we see Clo Clo whirling and turning in a tight circle. She is illuminated by several baby spots concealed at the base
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the fountain, and this light makes a nimbus of light around her. It is a sort of superaura which washes out the background haze, leaving the dancer clear-cut and sharp in the midst of this superaura.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Clo-Clo's dance widens in movement, taking her to the edge of the light nimbus, we can see her, the tables and the patrons of El Pueblo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The El Pueblo cafe is the smartest night club in this small New Mexican resort town. The main dining room is in the patio. Here are tables mantled in snowy tablecloths, glittering candlelight and sparkling glassware. On the porch is an open space for the performers and the orchestra on one side On the other side is a bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tonight, El Pueblo is crowded. Waiters, dressed in rather formal costumes with black trousers and short, white coats, scurry between the tables. A good portion of -the patrons are in evening clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo dances. The rhythmic rattle of her castanets beat out above the orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo is New Mexican. Like the broncos of her native state, she is all fine, proud, pure Spanish blood. It has suffered a change in the high clear air of New Mexico. In her dance, too, we see the more primeval strain of the Indian twisted among the finer threads of Spanish rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dances. In the pool we see the heavy flutter and turn of her skirt. Her neck, her bosom, her arms, bend and sway and turn and pulse with the bloodbeat of the castanets. She is just entering a graceful turn of the dance, the castanets beginning a glissade, when suddenly she stops dead, the click of the castanets cutting off abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - the doorway leading into the El Pueblo. Framed in this doorway is Kiki, slim and tall in a black gown with black gloves, and in her outstretched hand is a black leash which links her to the leopard. Behind her the doorway is hot with light so that we see her dramatic outline, a silhouette against luminosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT - the cafe. A buzz of amazement sounds from the crowd. There is a flutter of astonishment and timidity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Clo—Clo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of Kiki. Behind her in the doorway Jerry Manning's face appears. It is obvious that Kiki, despite her dramatic pose, is surreptitiously nervous.

<DIRECTION>
Kiki moves majestically forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT — a table near the dance space. Kiki, the leopard moving before her, threads her way between two tables, the patrons drawing away from her black escort as she passes. A waiter, carefully holding the chair between him and the leopard, makes a place for her at an empty table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo, feet wide apart, arms and hands still half raised and holding the castanets, watches. The orchestra plays feebly on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Clo—Clo smiles. She lifts her hands a little higher, takes a step forward and lets the castanets loose with a roll that sounds like machine—gun fire. The leopard startled,: twists in a half turn of fright, strains suddenly at the leash and lunges forward. The leash pulls out of Kiki's frightened hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REFLECTION SHOT in the pool. The still water reflects the quick bound and leap of the leopard in its panic flight for freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - Kiki. She stands leaning against the table, trembling in fright. Behind her Clo—Clo can be seen can be seen on the platform, smiling. Jerry comes into the scene, puts his arm about Kiki's waist.

<DIRECTION>
SHOT of four policemen, their backs toward us, going through the Alley of the Shadows. Two of them are beating on pots and pans to make a noise. Two others are flashing their flashlights from one side to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRUCK WITH them down the alley. They bring us to the open end of the passage, athwart which a fire truck is parked. Near this fire truck stands the Chief of Police, Robles, a dignified, well—spoken, Mexican police officer, serious and conscientious, very much on duty at all times.

<DIRECTION>
Robles nods. He makes a gesture to one of the men on the fire truck and two long lances of light pierce the darkness of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - Pasaje De Las Sombras. The shafts of light from the searchlights cross and re-cross, moving, as they explore the dark jags and corners of the alley. It is one of the oldest streets in town, so narrow that even at noonday, the sun has difficulty lightening its dark shadows. The adobe houses, standing wall to wall, were never built on any straight geometric line; the street makes a dog-leg, meandering, as if loathe to reach its own blind end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT — the mouth of the alley at the other side of the fire truck. This is a-scene of curiosity and confusion. A police cordon has been erected, and several uniformed Mexican policemen are busy shooing away the spectators, foiling the attempts of small boys to get under the ropes, and generally trying to reduce chaos to an ordered hunt for the leopard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the mouth of the alley, next to the fire truck is parked a curious conveyance, a half-ton truck with a gaudy sign which reads:

</CHARLIE_HOW_COME>
<DIRECTION>
A little Mexican boy who has seen listening to the conversation between Jerry and Charlie, is suddenly attracted by something off in the darkness. Grinning, he turns on the hand flashlight he is holding and points it off into the darkness of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - Clo-Clo's legs. The flashlight picks up a pair of shapely legs and holds on them as they move forward, The legs stop their walking motion and suddenly begin to stamp with the heel taps that are part of her dance. The light snaps off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

This is a small flower shop. One or two vases hold wilted flowers which have been left in the display window. Behind them is a mirror. In this mirror we can see the mouth of the alley and Clo-Clo as she walks away from the men and comes toward the flower shop.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo passes the flower shop and continues on.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DELGADO HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Delgado house is typical of the poorer Mexican homes in New Mexico. This main room, which is small, serves as living room, bedroom and kitchen. An Indian blanket covers the doorway into the only other room. The adobe walls are plastered with pictures of religious subjects. The wooden floor is bare. There is a charcoal-burning brasero in one corner. Pots and pans on the hearth of the fireplace show that it is a supplementary stove, The rest of the furniture consists of an iron bedstead, a large and hideous oak table and an open-faced china cabinet which contains the Delgado treasures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedro, Teresa's nine-year-old brother is seated at the oak table, eating from a bowl of frijoles. He is, and looks like, an imp. Teresa is backing away from her mother, who turns away from the window to face her angrily.

Sra. Delgado gives the broom such a backward swing of final purpose that Teresa hurriedly opens the door behind her and slinks out backwards -- her big liquid dark eyes, still futilely pleading, the last to disappear. Sra. Delgado moves after her, pushing the door closed.

<DIRECTION>
She puts the broom in the corner and goes to where Pedro is seated. Here she stands a moment, fondly watching him as he masticates his beans. Behind her the door stealthily opens. Teresa tries to sneak back into the room. Mamacita sees the movement and makes a tempestuous rush toward her, but Teresa sidles out of the door before she can be caught. Mamacita, muttering, slams the door shut and with difficulty pushes the heavy, rust-covered iron bolt into place.

EXT. CALDERON GROCERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a large corner window, with the word. "Provisiones" printed on it shows that this ordinary house is a grocery store. In the moonlight, one can see a few boxes of groceries stacked on shelves inside. Teresa comes up to the window and peers in. She knocks on the window.

Over Teresa's shoulder, we see the interior of the little store light up dimly as a curtain is pulled at the back of the room. Beyond the curtain is revealed another room, brightly lit by a bare electric globe hanging from the ceiling on a cord. Under the light, a man sits at a table, heartily eating from a plate heaped with food. The curtain has been pulled back by Senora Calderon. We see her only in silhouette and the details of her face and figure are indistinguishable. We do see, however, that her long black hair is down her back and she is braiding it. She walks a little ways into the darkened store.

EXT. EDGE OF ARROYO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Arroyo is a deep narrow cut in the mesa, bone—dry in this season. Its floor of bleached sand and weeds stretches desolately wider a vast moonlit sky. Here and there, children's feet have scuffed steep little trails down the banks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teresa appears at the top of one of these trails. She looks down into the Arroyo -- and then off to the right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A distance down the Arroyo is a bridge which carries a train track across the dry river bed. To divert the rush of rain water in winter and spring, the bridge is underpropped by two slanting stone piers. They stand out like ribs against the blackness of the underpass, which they divide into three tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teresa's face shows her dread of the Arroyo. She turns back the way she came, takes a step away, hesitates and then returns to the edge of the bank. She starts down the little trail, her feet sliding in the loose sand and a shower of pebbles bouncing down ahead of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARROYO FLOOR — NIGHT

Teresa stands at the bottom of the bank. She looks off to the bridge again. Then she starts walking forward slowly, a very little figure in the large loneliness of the night.

EXT. EAST SIDE OF BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teresa comes up to the face of the underpass with its three openings. She stares from one black tunnel mouth to another. She glances behind her, then looks at the underpass again. Teresa goes forward again, toward the middle tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EAST ENTRANCE OF MIDDLE TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roof of the underpass is only a little higher than Teresa's head and the passage is not more than ten feet wide. The opening is dimly lit by the moonlight, but beyond it is dense blackness. Teresa enters slowly. She takes a few steps toward the blackness —- and stops. She listens. Teresa moves forward again, walking as lightly as possible. The light dims rapidly, so that after Teresa has taken a half dozen steps, she is swallowed up in complete blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA HOLDS for a moment on the dark underpass before Teresa emerges from the blackness on the West side. A light scratching sound is heard. Teresa's eyes widen in panic as she hears it and she hurries out of the tunnel, watching fearfully ever her left shoulder. She must cut across in front of this other tunnel in order to get to the south bank. She starts across, never taking her eyes off the black tunnel mouth. Suddenly she gives a convulsive start and a little cry escapes before she can control it. A shadowy shape, low to the ground, detaches itself from the dimness of the tunnel opening and moves toward her. Almost at once, we see that it is a large tumbleweed, blowing clown the Arroyo in the wind. Teresa sighs soundlessly and goes on to the foot of the bank. She starts scrambling up another steep little path.

EXT. CORNER WEST SIDE OF BRIDGE - NIGHT

There is a sound of slow, measured dripping. It comes from water seeping out between two rocks and dropping onto another rock below. These rocks are piled up at the juncture of the bridge and the left bank and the water is evidently leaking from some water main or sews go pipe running under the highway overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEST SIDE OF BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teresa is approaching the entrance of the middle tunnel, She is evidently scared —- her footsteps are lagging and she holds the sack of corn meal in both hands, as if feeling its weight. She looks fearfully at the black tunnel before her and comes to a standstill, trying to peer into the blackness. In the silence, the dripping of the water can be heard. Teresa looks up and to the left to locate the sound. She sees the shining dampness on the rocks. She turns back to the middle tunnel before her -- and, drawing a deep breath of resolution, starts to enter it. But she hesitates and then, suddenly, veers over to the left. She peers into the opening of that tunnel.

The wall of the tunnel is also damp with the seepage from above. It reflects the outer moonlight in glistening streaks, so that the blackness here is not so complete as in the other tunnel..

Teresa gets a fresh grip on the bag of corn meal by shifting her hands under it -- and walks into the entrance of the north tunnel.

INT. NORTH TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the crunching sound of Teresa's footsteps are magnified in the enclosure of the tunnel walls. It is very dim, but the luminosity of the damp wall casts a faint light on Teresa, reflecting in her wide, frightened eyes. She walks slowly and lightly, her eyes going from side to side in the darkness, her neck and head held rigidly. Suddenly she stops with a sharp intake of breath, Ahead of her and to her left are two tiny gleams of light. Teresa backs away from them. As she does so, they seem to fall and vanish. Slowly Teresa moves forward again, staring at the place where the lights had been. As she moves parallel to the spot, they appear again. A half-cry dies away in her throat --she sees that the gleams are two drops of seepage, trickling down the side of the tunnel wall. Teresa half closes her eyes and sways a little, faint with fear. Then she forces herself to move forward again. She takes one -- two fearful steps -- and then the underpass reverberates with a sudden tremendous shock of sound -— more a giant vibration than actual noise. It is a train passing overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTH TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Teresa stands transfixed, the terrific roar continues. Second after second, flashes of light as brilliant as lightning illuminate the interior of the tunnel — the reflections thrown into the Arroyo by the train windows. And then, as abruptly as it began, the noise ceases. It is cavernously dark in the tunnel again. In this thick stillness, Teresa walks forward once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EAST SIDE OF BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the frame of the tunnel opening, Teresa stands for a moment. Behind her, there is a new sound -- a mere whisper of sound carried forward on the light wind. A little shower of rubble falls from the top of the concrete pier. Teresa turns to look behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouched on one of the piers of the trestle -— and seen only very dimly in the darkness -- is the leopard, looking down into the Arroyo.

EXT EDGE OF ARROYO - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Teresa scrambles frantically up over the edge of the bank. She stumbles ana falls and the sack of corn meal drops from her hands and spills onto the ground. In a single move, Teresa is on her feet and running again. A shadow flashes over the spilled meal and we hear a heavy, ripping snarl.

It is quiet and peaceful in the Delgado home. Senora Delgado is puttering about the brasero. Pedro, on all fours, is reading a comic book, his rump high in the air, his chin two inches from the book.

INT. UNDERTAKING PARLOR - DAY (AS SEEN THROUGH THE WINDOW)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This shop occupies an ordinary store building. The display window contains a solitary wreath of gilded leaves. Behind this wreath is a green baize curtain. The shop itself has a sad air of unctuous gentility. On the left side of the room are coffins on polished brass tressels. These coffins are half open to reveal the luxurious satin linings. In the back is a roll-top desk and swivel chair. In the rear of the shop is a door leading to the embalming room. This is curtained with the sane green baize. Over this whole interior is the eerie moire light that comes through the water-flowing window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uncomfortable and stiff in their grief, we see the Delgados. The fat Senora, the little boy and the father in his stiff blue serge Sunday suit, stand near the wall. With them is a nun in the sweet, sad costume of the Carmelite order. At the other side of the room stands Kiki, somewhat abased, and very ill at ease in the presence of the Delgados' grief.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of the doorway taking in the Delgado family. Senora Delgado is weeping, with tears running unchecked down her big flat cheeks. Her husband, unable to express his grief, stands twisting a cheap velour hat in work-gnarled hands. The little Delgado boy, unable to comprehend the finality of death is interested and quick-eyed, letting his glance rove from one object of interest to another, then suddenly bored, as is the manner of children, distracts himself by making the leopard shadow on the wall.
</DIRECTION>

From the other room we can hear, the sound of men's voices, not clearly distinguishable, but growing in clarity. Kiki opens her purse, fumbles out a little soiled sheaf of bills and crosses the room. She hands the money to the nun.

Midway through this action, the voice in the other room has risen in volume and clarity so that we hear the coroner speaking. From behind the green baize curtain the words come in that solemn, yet routine fashion, which is the specialty of county clerks and other minions of the law.

Chief Robles, with his uniform cap in his hand, goes over to the Delgado family. In his face we can see the sympathy and feeling he has for his fellow townsmen.

MED. SHOT - Undertaking Parlor - as the Delgado family emerges and starts down the street. The mother and father walk ahead, the father's arm about the mother's shoulder. They are followed by Pedro, his hand in the Nun's hand as they walk together. Kiki and Jerry fail to see them, and it is necessary for Senor Delgado to ask for room.

INT CLO-CLO'S DRESSING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LARGE HEAD CLOSEUP of Maria. The beautiful face of the fortune teller, coifed and framed in the folds of a shawl, looks pure and Madonna—like. Her downcast eyes add to the holy feeling. Then, suddenly, her hand comes up and puts a lighted cigarette droopingly between her lips. The Madonna pose is shattered as though a stone had been thrown into still water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES BACK to show Maria seated at Clo-Clo's dressing table, dealing out the cards. The last card to leave her hand is the Ace of Spades. She gazes at it for a moment, then hastily rakes up the deck and shuffles the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her during this entire scene we have heard the tinkle of Moorish finger cymbals in metronome-like rhythm, the sounds spaced far apart.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That card again?

</CLO_CLO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - Clo-Clo and Maria. Clo-Clo is behind Maria. She has on a practice suit; black jersey leotards to the waist and a black silk bandeau about her breasts. She is using the chair rail of the dressing room as a bar to practice a ballet step while she beats out the slow rhythm of her exercise with the Moorish finger cymbals. Maria again deals the cards and Clo-Clo continues to play and practice. There is a contrapuntal rhythm between the dealing of Maria's cards and the slow tinkle of the cymbals.

	I made a mistake. It was a misdeal. I'll try once more.

Maria unhurriedly snuffs out her cigarette, pockets her cards and starts for the door. As she opens the door, we see Jerry Manning going past, dressed in slacks and sports shirt, carrying his coat over his arm. He is dusty and tired. Clo Clo looks after him with a malicious grin.

<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.

Passing the table where Kiki, Jerry and Galbraith sit, she grins broadly end maliciously. Leaning slightly toward them she makes a derisive sound on her castanets, then stalks on. They follow her with their eyes as she starts down the steps. From the audience in the main portion of El Pueblo cafe comes the sound of brisk applause and Clo—Clo's answering hail on the castanets.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen a bit of life, and I have learned one thing. We are like that ball dancing on the fountain. We know as little about the forces that move us and move the world around us as that empty ball, which lives only because the water pushes it into the air, lets it fall and catches it again. You shouldn't feel too badly about Teresa Delgado.

TRUCKING SHOT of Clo-Clo as she walks wearily down the deserted street. She is smoking a cigarette. Swinging from one hand is the little ornamented chamois bag in which she keeps her castanets. She comes to the flower store, sees that it is open and, throwing her cigarette away, starts in.

INT FLOWER STORE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - Rosita, Senora Contreras' maid, has selected a bouquet of long stemmed roses from a large tin bucket. As she holds them aloft the flower vender, a chubby good-natured little Mexican in his late fifties, gently wraps a piece of newspaper around the wet stems.

The flower vendor laughs loudly, his body vibrating. Rosita sees no humor in this remark and taking a coin from her pocket, hands it to him. Still chuckling, the vendor moves to his cash drawer, to make change. In the b.g., Clo-Clo can be seen entering the store. She tiptoes forward directly behind the flower vendor and ignoring Rosita completely, snatches a wilted gardenia from a tin. The flower vendor has caught this action in the mirror and whirling, pulls the gardenia out of her hand,and at the same time turns back to the cash drawer. Clo—Clo isn't at all abashed by the vendor's action.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL CONTRERAS' HOME - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a cool, shadowy square room. At the back is a stairway. The floor is tiled. Through an arched grilled doorway, we can see the living room beyond. The front door opens and Rosita steps in hurriedly, her heels clicking on the tile floor. Three people are standing waiting. They are Senora Contreras, Cousin Felipe and Marta, an old servant who is more companion than maid in the household by this time. Marta is dressed all in black -— dress, shoes and apron. Her grey hair is dragged back to a knot. She wears tiny gold loops in her pierced ears and a gold cross at the fastening of her high collar. Senora Contreras, a dignified, imposing woman with the remnants of great beauty still apparent in her expressive eyes and lovely hair, is dressed in a flowing lacy negligee. In her arms she carries a little Chihuahua dog. Cousin Felipe is a dapper little cat of a man, meticulously dressed in the proper apparel of thirty years ago. The Senora and Cousin Felipe are waiting on the stairs. Marta is in the hail.

SHOT of Senora Contreras, Marta and Rosita as they come up to the landing and start on tiptoe toward a door. The Senora Contreras puts her hand on the knob softly. Cousin Felipe pulls a single rose from Rosita's armful. Marta sees him - she glares but says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONSUELO'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although the curtains of the room are drawn, the softly filtered daylight shows this to be a room of delicacy and lightness. The simplicity of the white walls, the sheer curtains hanging across the barred, embrasured windows, the lovely lace coverlet and the pretty young-girl trinkets on the dressing table give the room an air of lightness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door swings inward, the sunlight fills the room. Then we see, lying in the bed, serenely asleep, Consuelo Contreras. This is her eighteenth birthday.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Senora Contreras walks to the foot of the bed and stands looking down at her daughter. She smiles sadly. In still, untroubled sleep, the full vulnerability of Consuelo's youth is touchingly apparent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marta stands to one side, a little behind Senora Contreras. Cousin Felipe remains in the background, near the open door. Rosita tiptoes cautiously to the head of the bed and carefully puts down the roses, so that the blossoms lie in the curve of Consuelo's outflung arm. She has to drop on one knee to do this and she stays in this position, slowly drawing her hands away from the flowers. They start singing "Las Mananitas" the traditional birthday song of Mexico -- singing very softly at first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consuelo stirs slightly and then opens her eyes. Lying as she does, the first thing she sees are the roses, lying beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her eyes from the roses to see Rosita's eager smiling face, almost on a level with her own. Rosita's smile broadens but she goes on singing dutifully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still bemused, but beginning to smile faintly herself, Consuelo looks beyond Rosita and sees Cousin Felipe standing back by the door. Very much the gallant, he touches his stolen rose to his lips and tosses it to Consuelo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consuelo continues her survey of the room and turns her eyes to the foot of the bed.
</DIRECTION>

Consuelo starts to sit up, pulling the roses to her.

Rosita gets up, too, and props the pillows behind her young mistress. Senora Contreras comes around the bed and sits on the edge of it as the song finishes.

</MARTA>

Marta draws back the curtains and the room, already light, seems to grow even lighter. Senora Contreras leans forward and kisses Consuelo's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSUELO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a lovely way to wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>

She looks from the bouquet of roses to the single rose that Cousin Felipe threw onto the bed. She picks it up and holds it to her face.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSUELO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is so beautiful, Cousin Felipe. Thank you for buying it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSUELO>
<DIRECTION>
At Consuelo's first words, Cousin Felipe begins to beam. But he glances across the room and encounters Marts's grin, sardonic glance just as Consuelo says "How carefully you must have picked it out!" Abashed, he murmurs something unintelligible and quietly slips out of the room.

At the window, Rosita has been standing with her back to Marta, staring fixedly at Consuelo to attract her attention. She makes a little notion with her hands now and Consuelo glances at her. Smiling secretively, Rosita draws a white envelope part way out of her apron pocket, just enough to let Consuelo see what it is. Then she hastily puts it out of sight again. There is a sudden light in Consuelo's eyes. She is transfigured with a really exultant happiness.

The path Consuelo is on splits into two paths. In the V of the fork is a single grave and over it hovers a tall shaft of marble carved in the likeness of a brooding angel with folded wings and bowed head. Consuelo locks about frantically and then leans against the base of the statue, gasping for breath. Suddenly a wind springs up and the silence is broken into a thousand rustles and murmurs as the wind stirs through the trees. Consuelo shivers and slowly lifts her head to look up toward the tree tops. She looks directly up into the face of the statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of the angel's face is curiously sinister because there is light touching its contours.
</DIRECTION>

Consuelo whirls about to find the source of light. Through the wind-stirred branches she sees the great, lop—sided moons just rising into the night. She stumbles away from the statue and down the right—hand path, walking a few steps, then running a few steps, trying to force herself to rush on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Consuelo stands looking down into the old burial ground, a depression filled with weed-grown graves and ancient wooden headstones, either crazily askew or down entirely. It is entirely surrounded by the tall trees of the cemetery —— and the moonlight seems to fill the place with mist. Consuelo starts down the slope.

In fact, one massive bough extends out over the wall and Consuelo looks up at it hopefully. Then her expression changes — becomes tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Consuelo. Her eyes are wide and frightened. From the other side of the wall comes a sound — a light, scratching sound, exactly the same sound as that heard by Teresa Delgado in her first trip through the underpass tunnel. Listening intensely, Consuelo turns her head until her ear is pressed against the wall. Now, we hear the sound more distinctly — as she is hearing it — but it is still a light, feathery sound. Then, suddenly, it ceases. And as Consuelo strains to hear it again, there is the sharp, hollow clap of a car door carelessly flung shut just outside the wall. It is followed by the grind of a car starter. Consuelo jumps up.

There is the sound of the car drawing away. The sound of it lessens, fades — is swallowed in renewed silence. Consuelo stands against the wall, motionless. She turns fearfully, so that her back is to the wall, and peers into the shadows. Suddenly she stiffens.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Consuelo. Her eyes widen. She turns her head so that her ear is close to the wall. And again we hear the curious scratching sound, and with it, another sound —-- a soft, living, breathing sound, as of animal nostrils snuffling along the wall, searching the scent of prey. There is a brief silence, and then Consuelo's head snaps up as we hear a soft padding sound near the top of the wall. She sees only the moon, just visible in the space between the tree bough and the top of the wall. There is nothing to be seen —— but a rustling sound comes from the top of the wall. Consuelo's eyes are motionless, fixed on the bough overhead. Very gradually, the great bough lowers, blotting the moon from view. Consuelo presses her back against the wall, as if she would push herself into it, escape through it. Her head, thrown back, is motionless — her eyes watching the ominous movement of the great bough, are motionless. And as she stares, a spasm of terror contorts her face. The bough suddenly springs back and the moon can be seen for one instant. During that instant we hear simultaneously a low, horrible snarl and a scream. Both are cut off as the whole scene blacks out.

Five ladders, three against the outside wall, two against the inside wall, form a curious pattern of bars and stripes in the clean morning sunlight. Uniformed policemen and plain—clothesmen bustle about. One of them is making a moulage of footprints, his little working space roped off with twine and stakes Others are examining the tree. Two policemen, one uniformed, stand at the side and between them stands a young man dazed and broken, almost hanging in the grip of the officers. He is sobbing. This is Raoul Belmonte.

	Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it doesn't eat what it kills.

	I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.

	That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.

EXT. PORTICO OF THE MUSEUM — DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The museum is built on a hilltop and from the portico we overlook the sagebrush and mesquite-covered hills of New Mexico, rolling away to the horizon. At one end of this open porch an old Indian hand loom has been set up and here an Indian woman in Zuni costume sits patiently weaving a rug, the shuttle flying back and forth monotonously, and the foot pedal creaking as she changes threads. Charlie and Jerry come into the portico and cross to the door. They push open the heavy bronze door and enter the museum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This museum, probably erected with the aid of government funds, is well-proportioned and severely plain. A portico, a long, rectangular display room and a combined office and workshop in an alcove off the main room comprise the museum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The display room has glass showcases containing various Indian artifacts. On the walls are examples of Indian rug and blanket weaving, masks and ceremonial properties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith's workshop is completely practical. A trestle table with an office armchair behind it, book shelves and transfer cases containing labeled shards and artifacts are in this alcove. On the trestle table, which Galbraith uses as a desk, is a reading glass on a fixed stand which he uses to examine specimens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie and Jerry walk in. Charlie has evidently been here before because he shuffles down the main aisle through the display room without looking around. Jerry keeps pace with him but glances from side to side at various pieces. At the end of the museum they turn and enter the little alcove where Galbraith is seated at his desk. He is sharpening a pencil and does not look up. They wait.
</DIRECTION>
<GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, hello.

They have reached the display room and pause a moment. From this point on, the CAMERA TRUCKS WITH them as they go. Galbraith acts as cicerone, conducting them about, walking ahead of them as he displays the exhibits.
</DIRECTION>
<GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(squinting at it)
</DIRECTION>

	Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.

<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If a leopard didn't do it, who did?

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could be a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GALBRAITH>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?

</GALBRAITH>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some crazy guy.

</JERRY>
<GALBRAITH>

TRUCKING SHOT - Clo-Clo, dressed in dancing costume, with a black shawl over it, passes along the street, clicking her castanets idly. From afar we hear a sad, sweet Mexican love song, being sung in a high tenor voice.

A young boy is perched on ton of some vegetable crates on an old truck parked alongside the curb. He is singing for his own pleasure and hardly notices Clo-Clo as she passes. Smiling, she lifts one pair of castanets to follow the beat of his song. He waves to her and she passes on into the darkness beyond the truck.

The patio is pretty well filled with patrons. Clo-Clo, crossing the patio from the entrance gates to the bar in the rear, skirts the dance floor —- watching the customers with amusement. In doing so, she almost bumps into a waiter with a full tray. To let him pass, she backs aside and stands by one of the tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this table are three people; John Brunton, his daughter, Helene and her husband, Dwight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John Brunton is a heavy—set, rather impressive looking man of about sixty Because he is an older man with the air of authority which comes from success and money, you have to look twice to catch both the gaiety and the gentle irony in his eyes. Helene and Dwight are two of his closest reasons for that irony. They are nice-looking, well—groomed, somewhat conventionally smart people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting for the waiter to go by, Clo-Clo half turns and looks down at the three people. She smiles.

INT. BAR AT EL PUEBLO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quite a crowd of people are standing around the bar, either waiting for their drinks or drinking them there. Others are seated at the small tables here and there on the veranda that houses the bar. At a table quite near the steps leading down to the patio, Clo-Clo is seated. A tall, thin goblet of beer stands in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton starts up the steps.. Seeing him, Clo-Clo grabs the beer and puts it on the floor between her chair and the veranda railing. Then she starts looking toward the bar, as if waiting for someone to wait on her.

INT. BAR AT EL PUEBLO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton is now seated at the little table with Clo-Clo. Near them, a waiter is preparing to open a bottle of champagne from an ice bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
(to the waiter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a moment
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Clo—Clo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look —- you've ordered this stuff like a sensible girl --but you don't have to drink it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo studies him, a little warily.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want it? Or do you want another beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over the side of the table and gently nudges the hidden goblet with the toe of his shoe, For a moment Clo—Clo is startled — then she begins to grin.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
(to the waiter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two beers -- big ones!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton looks off toward the steps. An expression of dismay comes over his face. Clo—Clo turns around to see Dwight coming up to them. Dwight looks from Clo-Clo to the unopened champagne —- and then smiles at his father-in—law with a disagreeably "understanding" smirk.
</DIRECTION>
<DWIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've finally gotten around to our dinner --

</DWIGHT>
<BRUNTON>

<DIRECTION>
(nasty-nice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry -- but you know how Helene is -- she's been worrying about you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
Still smiling, Dwight turns away. Clo-Clo looks after him and then straightens around and faces Brunton again.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(flippantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That depends. How much money has he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton studies her -- not disapprovingly, but as he would study a child or an animal that appealed to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.

</BRUNTON>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't understand that fancy talk.

(echoing her calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not -- if you like it —- if that's what you really want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo sniffs angrily. The waiter serves the two glasses of beer. Clo—Clo grabs hers and gulps thirstily.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-

Clo—Clo shrugs her shoulders in a dramatic gesture of indifference.

<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>

Again Clo-Clo shrugs her shoulders.

</BRUNTON>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know —-

</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo looks down at her glass of beer, sullenly. Brunton watches her, not saying anything.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(in a sudden outburst)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
(kindly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
In spite of herself, Clo-Clo starts smiling. Brunton smiles back at her and lifts his glass of beer. She lifts hers to touch it in salute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Brunton's table. The younger Bruntons are half-way through dinner. He looks at his watch. She frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rises and he helps her on with her stole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John Brunton is still seated at the little table. He is laughing and coughing from the exertion of the laughter. Clo Clo stands behind him, thumping him on the back. She looks worried. Several people in the bar are watching them with amusement -- but a nice kind of amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll kill yourself. Isn't there something sad we can talk about, just until you get over this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton wipes the tears of laughter from his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we were supposed to be doing this time. But the sadder you try to be, the funnier it comes out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<HELENE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father!

Brunton makes a little face and then turns around to see Helene who is coming coward him from the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENE>
<DIRECTION>
(furiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We finished dinner hours ago.

<DIRECTION>
Brunton gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I'll be with you as soon as I've settled this ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
He waves his hand at the glasses on the little table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a fishy eye for Clo-Clo, Helene turns and goes back down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you let her boss you around like that? Give her a good slap and tell her to keep still!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton chuckles. He takes some change from his pocket and puts it down on the little table. The waiter from the patio comes up the stairs and hands him the bill on a plate.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame will be waiting at the entrance -—
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton looks at the bill and then reaches into an inner pocket for a wallet. He takes a couple of greenbacks from it and hands them to the waiter. The waiter bows and smiles and goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame will be waiting -- Madame ought to go on waiting! To have such a father and treat him like a poor cousin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Brunton smiles again -- he starts to put his wallet away — then opens it up again and takes a single bill from another compartment. He puts it in Clo-Clo's hand and folds her fingers over it.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for "mama and the kids."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking at the bill; kidding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get your money from your husband.

Clo—Clo stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlos What's-His-Name -- the boy at the grocer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNTON>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo looks at him questioningly for a moment —- then very suddenly puts her arms around his neck and kisses his cheek. Brunton, greatly touched, pats her shoulder. They smile at each other -- and then Brunton turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo looks after him, then down at her hand. She lifts the fingers from the bill crushed in her palm. Her eyes widen in shocked amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT $100 bill, crumpled in her hand -- The fingers close on it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG HEAD CLOSE-UP - Clo-Clo. She smiles happily and starts off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE IN

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo is scurrying down the street as fast as her stilt heeled pump will carry her. Her face is bright with excitement and she hums to herself, snapping her fingers in imitation of her castanets. She passes the flower shop and then the window of the store where Maria tells fortunes. Clo Clo hesitates -- goes back and peers through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORTUNE TELLING BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the store is dismal. On one wall hangs a phrenological chart. In the center of the room is a plain kitchen table with two rickety chairs, one of them a bentwood affair with a sagging cane seat. On the table sleeps a white cat, curled up against a cracked crystal ball. A cheap thick restaurant saucer on the table is more than half—filled with cigarette butts and ashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maria is seated at the table. A cigarette is in her mouth. She just sits there, not touching the deck of cards in front of her —— staring across at the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the sound of the door opening and Maria looks up. She says nothing as Clo-Clo comes into the place, but waits until Clo-Clo stands beside the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The elderly man I told you about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo shrugs her shoulders and sits down at the table,
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was old enough -- but you slipped up on the money. Try it again, why don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Maria looks at her sardonically, but obligingly picks up the deck of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your wish in them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo shuffles thorn a few times and then hands them to Maria. Maria cuts them into seven piles, face down. She starts turning up the top card on each pile.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at Clo-Clo who maintains a completely blank expression. Clo-Clo smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe a honeymoon --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Maria starts to turn up the next card, with a practiced roll of the wrist —- as she sees what it is, however, she drops it and quickly swirls all the cards together again and hands the pack to Clo-Clo.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(astounded)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing that for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Maria shrugs her shoulders. Clo-Clo cuts the deck into three sections. Maria starts turning the top cards.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
(murmuring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo looks down at the cards, perplexed because Maria is perplexed. She sees a ten of diamonds followed by a four of spades. The third pile is still untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something black —- something on its way to you ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on -—
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Maria stares down at the third pack and then, with a deft twist, flips the top card face up. Almost simultaneously, Maria slaps her hand over it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see it ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, seemingly reluctantly, Maria uncovers the card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT The Ace of Spades.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The death card - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo just stands there, staring down at the card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo nods her head slowly. She lays some silver on the table in payment for the reading, then goes across the room to the door. Maria stands up and walks over to join her. Clo Clo stands looking out of the door. She turns abruptly to Maria, at her elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk a little ways with me —-?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Maria shrugs her shoulders. Clo—Clo starts out the door, Maria behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo and Maria walk in silence past the doorway where Shorty blew the smoke ring, past the perch where the boy and girl were kissing -- past the dark Delgado house. Clo—Clo glances up at the window as they go by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sidewalk is so high above the street here that there are three stone steps set in the curb. Clo-Clo goes down the steps, but Maria stops at the top. Clo—Clo turns and looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
Maria says nothing, Just stands there with an odd, mocking little smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you tomorrow —-
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<MARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow -—
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARIA>
<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo continues across the street and up the curb steps on the other side. At the top of those steps, she turns and looks back. The corner where she had left Maria is now empty. The moonlit street stretches deserted on either side. Clo-Clo hurries on again, almost running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET CORNER RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a nice residential section, more American in feeling than the other streets we have seen. There are trees on either side of the street and the moonlight makes lacy patterns through them. A shoulder-high brick wall encloses the garden of the house on the corner. Clo-Clo is walking along this brick wall. A purr of sound quickly lifts to the sound of a high-powered motor and the glare of headlights precede a long, low black roadster. The car comes around the corner and stops. A young man leans out on the driver's side
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, chiquita, want a lift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>

Clo-Clo stops and eyes him speculatively.

Clo-Clo backs up against the brick wall.

Clo-Clo starts running along the wall, looking back in terror over her shoulder. The young man looks after her dumbfounded.

EXT. CLO-CLO'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a small, ordinary clapboard house. In front of it is a scraggly, dusty attempt at a lawn and garden. A mongrel pup lies on the dusty path sleeping. Suddenly he leaps up and barks sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be still, Pancho!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo walks up the path to the house. She opens the front door, pushes Pancho away with her foot and slips into the house, closing the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLO-CLO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the shadowy light of a single candle, Clo-Clo's small bedroom can be seen only dimly. In it are a bed with iron bedstead, an ancient wooden rocking-Chair, a chest of drawers, and a little child's bed. The candle stands in a saucer on top of the chest. A little girl is sleeping in the large bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo comes into the room. She sits down on the edge of the bed and pulls the little girl into her arms. The child murmurs sleepily and snuggles up to Clo-Clo.
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
(happily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pepita, tomorrow..I'm going to buy you the most beautiful silk dress in the world.

The little girl tries to open her eyes, but the lids flutter closed again and the child goes on sleeping.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe me, do you?

She lays the child in the smaller bed and pulls up the full, ruffled skirt of her costume..
</DIRECTION>
<CLO_CLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait until you see what I have — then you'll wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLO_CLO>
<DIRECTION>
She runs her finger under the rolled top of one of her silk stockings. She looks startled. Then, she stands up and pulls the costume back over the other leg. She looks in that stocking roll. She stands stricken under the realization that she has lost the money.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you Gabriela? What's the matter?

</MOTHER_S_VOICE>

Clo-Clo doesn't answer. She scuffs off her shoes and looks in them. She drags off the long stockings, standing first on one leg and then the other. She turns them inside out and shakes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo's mother appears in the doorway. She is a prematurely -aged woman with her hair in two braids and wearing a torn wrapper.
</DIRECTION>

Clo-Clo thrusts her feet into the slipper, not bothering to put the stockings on again. She grabs up a shawl from the foot of the bed and throws it over her shoulders.

	Are you going out again, hijita? Why don't you stay home and rest -—

EXT. STREET CORNER IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo walks into the scene very slowly, scanning every inch of the sidewalk, from the curb to the brick wall and back again, over and over as she moves toward the corner. She retraces the pattern of her steps when she stopped to talk to the Young Man -- out to the curb —— back to the wall and along the wall to the corner. She then turns the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET WITH RAMADA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo-Clo looks down her side of this street. She looks across the street. Clo—Clo half turns, as if to retrace her steps —- but just then something further down the sidewalk catches her eye. She runs along the wall and leans down to grab at the bit of folded green and white paper there. The elation dies from her face. Stonily, rigidly she stares at it, the wrapper from a stick of gum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a tiny sound -- no more than a flicker of sound. Clo—Clo lifts her face slowly. There is no movement anywhere, no further sound. Clo-Clo looks to the building. There are alternate bands of black darkness and moonlight. Clo—Clo's eyes move from one to another. There is no movement behind any of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frowning a little, Clo-Clo starts back toward the corner. As she moves, she hears footsteps across the street in the black shadows. Listening, she walks more softly. But there is no fear in her expression or her posture. She is only curious. Suddenly, she whirls and looks across the street. There is nothing over there, nothing moving, nothing making sound. She walks on to the corner arid, looking back once, goes on around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET CORNER IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clo—Clo walks away from the corner, along the brick wall, very slowly. Her eyes go from side to side and she turns her head slightly, as she listens. She stops. Behind her, back around the corner, she hears footsteps
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
—- and then an imitative silence. She takes a few more steps, stops suddenly again -— and again the pursuing footsteps overlap hers. As Clo-Clo stands there, the silence is protracted. Puzzled, but still showing no expression or gesture of fear, Clo-Clo listens, then smiles and turns back.

BIG CLOSEUP — Clo—Clo. There is a tiny sound - and some grains of pebble and brick-dust trickle down the wall behind Clo-Clo's head. She looks down, puzzled, and then - very slowly - lifts her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enormous HEAD CLOSEUP of Clo-Clo. The mouth goes slack and the eyes widen in the shock of absolute horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH of the lipstick dropping from Clo-Clo's limp fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hoarse cry of terror is broken off by a violent snarl and a FLASH of Clo-Clo's body arching back -- almost in the posture of a dance -- away from the assault of something black which rises from lower left-hand corner of the frame and instantly blacks out the entire screen.

The priest stands at the head of the grave, dressed in his vestments, and with the open prayer book in his hand. At the grave side are a few mourners, Clo Clo's mother and her little covey of brothers and sisters are all huddled together at the foot of the grave. Between them and the priest stand a small group: Robles, Jerry, Mr. Brunton, Galbraith, Charlie How-Come, the Florist and Belmonte. The priest is just finishing the service.

From some distance away we hear the tolling of church bells. The attendants slowly begin to lower the coffin into the grave. The florist who had begrudged Clo-Clo one wilted flower comes forward and lays a whole armful of roses on the descending coffin. Jerry follows him. He puts Clo-Clo's castanets among the flowers. The coffin sinks slowly from sight. One of the attendants takes a spade. We hear the hollow thump of the first spadeful as it strikes the casket.

	But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.

<DIRECTION>
Galbraith nods his head. He starts walking slowly forward again and Jerry goes along with him.
</DIRECTION>
<GALBRAITH>

	If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.

	<DIALOGUE>
	To the eye? Like other men.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.

Raul props himself on one elbow and looks across at the photograph himself.

Jerry goes over to him and puts his hand on his shoulder.

<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, boy. I want to talk to you. Maybe there's something I can do —-

Raul reaches down and gets the bottle and the glass. He starts automatically to pour a drink for himself —— then stops and holds out the bottle and glass to Jerry.

Jerry takes the bottle-and glass and carries them over to the table. He puts them down and then comes back to Raul, who has sat watching him stupidly.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You've got to kick at something, fight with something, to work the nightmares out of your system. In Consuelo's case, there's been nothing to fight against -— just fate and a dumb brute animal.

INTERSECTION OF THE ALLEY AND THE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The commemorative procession is forming here. Some of the participants are hooded, wearing black hoods very much like these worn by the Ku Klux Klanners. In the doorways and windows, the townspeople are watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith passes through the crowd. He has a small paper package in his hand, his pipe in his mouth and is walking along, obviously on his way to somewhere. Eloise, who is standing watching the Processionists, blocks his way for a moment. He tries to pass around her. She sees him and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ELOISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELOISE>
<GALBRAITH>

(a little puzzled and trying to pass on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening.

</GALBRAITH>
<ELOISE>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELOISE>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.

EXT CEMETERY WALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith is walking along the quiet, empty street outside the cemetery wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a very faint cry from inside the cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith slows his stride perceptibly, but does not stop.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s., very faint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Get me out! Help! Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith stops and looks up at the cemetery wall,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Galbraith shows fear and puzzlement in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still looking toward the wall, Galbraith walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CORNER WHERE CLO-CLO WAS KILLED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith is walking along the brick wall, approaching the corner. Just before he gets to the corner, a lighted cigarette spins out and falls to the pavement in front of him. Galbraith stops as if he had come up against stone. He stands there, forcing courage to go on. He takes the few steps to the corner and faces the direction from which the cigarette was thrown. There is on one in sight anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very slowly, Galbraith reaches down and picks up the cigarette. The unlighted end is dark with lipstick. With an almost imperceptible shudder, Galbraith lets the cigarette fall. Walking rigidly, he continues on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The large room is in shadowy darkness. The heavy front door swings open. Suddenly the place is brilliantly lighted from the overhead fixtures. Galbraith takes his hand from the light-switch just inside the door. He pushes the clear closed and leans up against it exhaustedly. He is breathing heavily and his eyes are dull and heavy-lidded with the reaction from violent fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs deeply and then walks slowly and wearily across the display room to the office alcove. He sits down at his worktable and starts work on a small model of Indian ruins, done in colored clays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, far away but clear in the silence, he hears the sound of castanets —— just three widely spaced clicks. His hands becomes motionless above the model —-but he does not look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same sound comes again, repeated twice, the clicks a little more rapid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith gets to his feet and stands staring into the empty, brilliantly lighted museum room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The castanets sound again and this time they go into a steady rhythm, still faint and faraway; a purr of sound. But the sound increases in volume and intensity every second. Galbraith listens, his eyes mirroring his growing terror, his hands pressing down onto the worktable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The castanets come up to a brain—splitting reverberation of sound. The tendons in Galbraith's neck stand out —— his forehead is wet with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the tenseness of his body and the madness in his eyes signal that his control is about to break —— the castanet furor abruptly ceases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For another few seconds, Galbraith stands there Then he lifts his hands from the table and draws in a deep shuddering breath. He takes a handkerchief from his pocket and slowly wipes his face and his bands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Re steps out of the alcove and presses a light—switch on the wall nearby. The overhead lights in the display room go out. The alcove is new like a little lighted stage at the end of a dark auditorium. Galbraith steps back into it, takes a book from the worktable and settles down in an armchair at one end of the table. He begins to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the front door opening breaks suddenly into the stillness. It brings Galbraith to his feet in an instant. His book falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the shadowy display room, a figure moves to the accompaniment of a woman's brisk footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no terror in Galbraith's face this time -- but he waits tensely to-identify his visitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiki steps into the lighted alcove.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've disturbed you. I'm sorry -

</KIKI>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——

Kiki steps closer to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came up on the spur of the moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith leans down and picks up the book.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to see the procession —— and I remembered your kind invitations --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles a little uncertainly.
</DIRECTION>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought they came right past here ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<GALBRAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They do, but -- there are no lights out there —- they'll just be shadows -—
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiki moves across the alcove to a window.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not so terribly dark out. If we turn off these lights, we can see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
A panic-stricken look leaps into Galbraith's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(no trace of fear in his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No use turning the lights out until they get here..
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Kiki stands looking out at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they're coming now, listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
Very faintly, in the far distance, can be heard the chanting of the procession.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith listens as if he wore listening to Fate itself.
</DIRECTION>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn off the lights --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith stares across at her. With great effort, he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
(thickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALBRAITH>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
As if hypnotized, Galbraith walks out of the alcove and to the light-switch on the nearby wall. His fingers move up towards the second switch.. He still stares toward Kiki. He has the set, bloodless look of a man-lost in some fearful resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Kiki. For the first time, we see that she is terrified. She is looking at the window where Galbraith is faintly mirrored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Galbraith's hand on the light-switch. The fingers curve claw-like as he pushes down the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM ALCOVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the window, the reflection is blotted out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside we can see the processionists marching. The pin points of their candles are making bright spots against the dark background of their robes and the night sky. The loader chants and the rest answer him monotonously, over and over again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiki stands at the window. Behind her Galbraith crosses from the light switch, walking normally, his footsteps following one another with great regularity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiki stands perfectly still, keeping her eyes to the window. Only her left hand slowly rising to press against her heart betrays her anxiety. As the hand rises we pick up the beat of her heart. (Trick effect.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith comes closer and closer until finally he stands behind her. The beating of her heart subsides. There is perfect silence. Even the processionists cease their chant for a moment. Kiki and Galbraith stand this, way for an instant,, then suddenly Galbraith moves violently toward her. She screams. The side door bursts open and Jerry and Belmonte come pell—mell into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has all happened with such suddenness that for a moment Galbraith stands stock still. The two grapple with him. This physical contact rouses him. He shakes himself loose and dodges around the desk. They chase after him through the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISPLAY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith runs in, followed closely by Jerry and Belmonte. He dodges among the showcases. He tries the great door. It has been locked. He turns and starts running back toward the alcove. They stop him. He dodges them and goes on. Jerry starts after him again. Belmonte reaches under his coat and pulls out a revolver. The movement has caught Jerry's eye and he turns.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raoul -- don't. Put that gun away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry runs on, without seeing whether or not Raoul has obeyed his order. With the gun still in his hand, Raoul follows after.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM DISPLAY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galbraith runs in past Kiki, who has left the window and is standing in front of the desk. Just as he passes her,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry reaches him, grabs his arm and whips him around. The two men struggle. Belmonte comes up. To avoid the struggling men, Kiki steps backward and knocks against the showcase containing the butterflies. It falls with a great crash and the sound of breaking glass, Kiki falls with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry glances over and sees Kiki on the floor. He lets go of Galbraith who dodges out of the side door, Belmonte after him. Jerry kneels down beside Kiki.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiki?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JERRY>
<KIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. I'm not hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIKI>
<DIRECTION>
He scrambles up from his knees and runs after Belmonte.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The processionists slowly climb the hill toward the cross. The leader is still calling out and the others answer him in the long established rigmarole of their ceremonies. Galbraith with a hurried look over his, shoulder runs into the scene and slips in with the marching men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of Galbraith as he makes him way to the center of the marching column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jerry and Belmonte stand panting beside the marching column of processionists. He looks right and loft. There is no sign of Galbraith. He, too, falls in the rank near the end of the procession. He begins to slowly make his way to the head of the column, peering under the hats and into the dark faces of the men. His gun is still in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE of the marching column. We see Galbraith in the very center and behind him Jerry and Belmonte come up and look into his face. They seize his arms. Galbraith struggles to get away from them. There is a disturbance in the ranks of the processionists. Quickly, six of the enormous, tall, hooded figures gather menacingly around the center of the disturbance. No word is spoken. There is only the convergence of these six great figures about the two struggling men. The three men subside. Galbraith ceases to struggle. The six hooded men leave them, drawing back to the flanks of the procession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT of Jerry and Galbraith. The two men are close together, but march on in step with the processionists, and as they walk, they talk sotto voce. Despite the urgency of what one demands from the other and the other denies, the silent authority of the hooded figures mutes their voices.
</DIRECTION>

Jerry studies Galbraith. A new note has crept into the man's voice -- an odd note of irrationality and self—pity.
</DIRECTION>

	In the whole world there isn't a single human being who knows what it is to be tormented this way --

</GALBRAITH>
<DIRECTION>
The procession has reached the crest of the hill. As the head of the column begins to make its way around the cross the whole file slows from a march to a shuffling half step. Jerry and Belmonte seize the opportunity to edge Galbraith out of the column toward a Joshua tree. They stand in its deep shadow while the procession goes on and off.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE SHOT of Jerry and Galbraith, with Belmonte close to Galbraith in the b.g.

<GALBRAITH>

<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Galbraith's two hands lift, the fingers curved slightly inwards. He looks at them as if he, too, were terrified by their deadly potentiality.

	And then --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, strangely and appallingly)

<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Belmonte comes up close. Agony passes over Belmonte's face and contorts it... His hand squeezes down on the gun. A shot roars out. Galbraith falls, silently crumpling down at the base of the Joshua tree. Belmonte throws the gun away and stands looking at him.

T. C. Johnson' s undertaking parlour is lighted and the light falls out of the window in. a great broad path onto the dark sidewalk. Jerry and Kiki come out of the building. They pause and stand in the broad glow of light from the window. For a moment they are silent. Behind them, in the shop, we see Raoul Hobbs and two policemen.
