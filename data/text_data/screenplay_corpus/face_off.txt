EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus. On the adjacent unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5). Clutching a balloon, Matty waves at his dad. A happy moment, like so many certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching them THROUGH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the target. They round the bend and disappear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATTHEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loses his grip on the unicorn. Archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap. They happily ride together...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see the sniper. CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient, aggressive, sexual. His finger closes around the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back. Bleeding... he drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the carousel. His eyes desperately searching... searching... searching... until he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matthew lies on his back -- still. Slowly, Archer reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see COLOR for the first time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FBI BRIEFING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAROUSEL HORSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sweeps by, as if marking time itself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLY PLACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden cross. A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer. The glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb. This is no chapel... but an atrium. Somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sweeps by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in front of it. Totally hidden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is on a computer screen. His criminal dossier scrolls by endlessly: bombings, assassinations, mercenary kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully. Other agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid- maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and coffee cups. These people are on high alert.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any follow-up from L.A.P.D. Intelligence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, nothing yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUZZ>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get them on the phone -- now. What about S.I.S. and our airport teams?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<WANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've had everything from psychics to satellites on this. Even if Castor was here... he must have slipped the net by now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WANDA>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's here! And we're going to keep looking until we find him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
A silence descends on the chastised team. As they go back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer aside.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon, these people have been working round the clock -- you gotta cut them some slack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then...
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll cut them some slack when I cut myself some slack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him. An Hispanic voice startles him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANITOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANITOR>
<CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(in perfect Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus in the labyrinth -- where's the men's room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<JANITOR>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This area is off limits, Padre.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: security door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get in that room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANITOR>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing the JANITOR is already too suspicious, Castor puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... I have a confession to make, but you aren't gonna like it. I was planting a bomb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<JANITOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bomb?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANITOR>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know -- boom --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(patting his neck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, never mind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his head. As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a stairwell. Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in Castor's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs -- making everything look like an accident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - DAY (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold the Lamb of God." Clergy and lay persons listen reverently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually heading for the exit. As he passes the risers, a teenage girl drops her sheet music at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's practically licking it.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.' But your voice makes even a hack like Handel seem like a genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He pats her behind and leaves. Although a little shaken, she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The marquee proclaims: INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th- 21st: AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The office is a monument to obsession: photographs, clues, newsclips, totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing Archer.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I don't have time to get a warrant from some hung-over judge. Just give me the go-ahead, Victor, and I promise -- as soon as this is over -- you can brand my butt with the Fourth Amendment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The instant Archer hangs up -- the INTERCOM BUZZES.
</DIRECTION>
<KIM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, your wife's on line one... S.I.S. on two...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIM>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her to hang on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A jet was chartered at Anderson Airfield. Guess who just showed up to pay for it? Pollux Troy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scramble the Reaction Team -- we're moving out. And get one of our people on that plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there's still no sign of Castor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where one brother goes, the other's sure to follow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
They rush our... the hold button on line 1 still blinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleek Cadillac pulls in... stopping next to a Land Rover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LARS MUELLER -- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets out of the Caddy. An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER -- emerges from the Rover. They are identical twins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear doors of their respective vehicles. Castor emerges from the Caddy -- Armani clad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother POLLUX TROY -- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're 26 minutes late. The casing didn't fit -- right? I knew that cheap-shit Dietrich would rip us off...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot to turn the damn thing on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the twins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's kidding...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs Castor by throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... are you fucking kidding!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
Castor hugs Pollux lovingly. Pollux squirms like a kid.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bro -- everything went fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate when you call me bro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
Pollux heads for the jet. Castor hands Lunt a wad of cash.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for babysitting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<LUNT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNT>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll contact you when we get the rest of the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and stat away from downtown. The inversion layer's going to be pretty thick around the 18th.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The twins nod... then take off. Castor heads for the jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his seat. A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him a Scotch. He downs it, looking her over salaciously.
</DIRECTION>
<FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls her into lap)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the only way to fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor yanks open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
AT END OF RUNWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel is Jon Archer. Beside him is Tito.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO ARCHER
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Archer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gun to Pilot's head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, dammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand. he turns around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them -- holding a smoking pistol. This is Agent WINTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	F.B.I.! Throttle down, captain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
But Castor elbows the throttle up. The jet lurches forward, throwing Winters off balance. Pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HUMVEE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer slams the vehicle into gear.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Tito obeys as Archer peels out. The HUMMER ROARS at the jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLLISION COURSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as two hunks of metal bear down. The machines are seconds apart when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer looks up to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, Castor holding a gun to her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet. The Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but too late. Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a swirl of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens. Castor blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-CHUNK: Something POUNDS the jet -- from above. Castor leans out the hatch and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs. Archer jerks and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS. The chopper pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jet finally lifts off... when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TARMAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a deadly game of leap-frog with the jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The end of the runway is coming up fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JET PILOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
can't budge the jet's jammed yoke. Thwarted, he powers back the throttle. Thrust reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The horizontal elevator's smashed! We can't lift off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
CASTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTS the Pilot -- then takes the controls. He struggles to maneuver the jet. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A biplane descends right at them -- about to land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls up just as the JET swerves radically to avoid the biplane and SLAMS into the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
plows through the GLASS DOOR, the NOSE-WHEEL SNAPS off. The PLANE SKIDS right into the hangar -- finally stopping at the wings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FBI CHOPPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lands. Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to write a traffic ticket. He hurries to join more FBI agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANGAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it, FIRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two FBI agents drop -- riddled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pollux appears at the hatch -- an FBI sharpshooter FIRES, grazing Pollux's shoulder. Staggered, Pollux falls --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor catches him before he hits the floor -- simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his anger building. He signals Tito and the others to spread out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEEP IN HANGAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery. Led by Archer, the FBI agents pick their way through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something? Advancing carefully, he comes up on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound. Pollux sees the agent -- and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tito is at the wheel. Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to dive off. The forklift careens on -- driving apart the brothers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning Pollux. Castor tries to free his trapped brother.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it -- Go! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps his Glock into Pollux's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherever they put you, I'll find a way to get you out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's head. As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- not unless you want that 200 I.Q. splattered all over the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Archer approaches)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got him now, Jon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you always say. Seal it off. I'm going in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear. He draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy movements mirroring Castor's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers. The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering the challenge. As the deadly beat between them continues --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM BLAM BLAM! Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT as necessary:
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how much will your 'fun' net you this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM BOOM BOOM! Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning. A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP! He fits a new CLIP into his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a week --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaoh. I'll give it up -- but my brother and I have to walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No discussion -- no deals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you gonna do with me locked up? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out. Silence -- then Archer senses...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor is behind him. He FIRES -- Archer dives away. The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines. As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP- SNAP. Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRRRROOOM! The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on! Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me he didn't get away again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless body. Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile survives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my brother?! I want to see my brother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards. Bullying through the media, Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the devastation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded on the ambulance. A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.
</DIRECTION>
<LAZARRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The oversight committee would've roasted us for this one -- thank God it paid off. Damn fine work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARRO>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real fine, Victor. Especially the casualties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked. Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively, the two men close ranks. Archer grabs the Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.
</DIRECTION>
<LAZARRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Classified information. No photographs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARRO>
<DIRECTION>
Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and leads him away from the media... and the carnage.
</DIRECTION>
<LAZARRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Jon?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Archer's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go home. Tell Eve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARRO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET

<DIRECTION>
A renovated Craftsman. Sipping a carton of milk, Archer pulls into the driveway. He sits, gathering his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer enters and sees his wife EVE. Handsome, intelligent.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods toward the KITCHEN. JAMIE is there -- a sullen and hard fifteen-year-old. There are cigarette cartons on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She complimented for her 'F' in history with an 'A' in shoplifting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of Marlboros. Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice stunt, Jamie. You break the law and I'm expected to ignore it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right -- it's all about you. Don't even ask me what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Archer looks to Eve for help. Eve shakes her head -- nope.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. What happened?

But he's too overcome. He starts to speak -- but can't.

<EVE>

	Is it -- him? It's... it's over?

Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up. Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them both.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>

INT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall. He pauses at the door to Jamie's room when he sees -- Jamie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered with clothes and assorted girl-stuff. Her face peaceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer looks around her room... sees the stuffed animals collecting dust... replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake Calvin Klein ads and band posters, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's startled to see a lacey bustier... his little girl is growing up fast. And he's missing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out. The instant he leaves, Jamie kicks the blankets off.

INT. BULL PEN - DAY

Efficient as a beehive -- agents, cryptologists, support staff buzz at their routines. Archer strides through -- drawing congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's team is there. Applauding. Proud. Uneasy with plaudits, he disperses the disappointed agents.

Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through Castor's file. He grimly contemplates face-after-face of Troy's victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son Matthew.

Burying his feeling, he types "CASE CLOSED" over Castor's image. Archer starts to press "enter" when Tito comes in.

STEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE

Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible precision. The light forces a chemical reaction -- and out of the soup -- an ear begins to form. It rises from the liquid, now fully-formed. The surgeon takes the ear and fits it in place on Loomis's head. He starts suturing.

Archer says nothing... it's too late for debate. Tito parks. The men get out and head for the lab.
</DIRECTION>

	You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24- hour hard-on. He's nothing like you --

	Don't worry... If Hoag can do half what he claims, I'll get Pollux to talk.

Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him.

	It's not that simple, Jon... Becoming another person -- especially him -- nobody can come all the way back from that... not even you.

As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look passes between the two friends.

INT. SURGICAL BAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two huge video screens are dominated by the CG-images of Archer and Castor. As Hoag briefs the team, the CG- images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag refers to.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's walk through it, Jon. Your blood types are different, but we can't do anything about that. Otherwise, nature is cooperating nicely. The height difference is negligible -- within 1/2 an inch. Eye color -- almost a perfect match. Penis size, flaccid, essentially the same -- Substantial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAG>
<DIRECTION>
From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the video screens, the images morph to signify the physical augmentations.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hairline will be adjusted with laser-shears... micro-plugs for the body hair... the teeth will be bonded to match Castor's...

Hoag eyes Castor's inert, tight body -- then turns to Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock inspector.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about an abdominoplasty?

</HOAG>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abdomino -- what?

TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and Castor's body parts as necessary):
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's obliques. At the same time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's thigh. We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Tito. The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself. Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously casual, like a panther.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them over Archer's fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare. Tito hands him a lit cigarette. Archer brings the cigarette to his lips -- then coughs harshly. But he keeps trying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs. PULL BACK to reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on a monitor-screen -- mimicking him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin spots. Giving up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tito tosses a pistol. Archer catches it with his right hand. But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice catch. But you used the wrong hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left hand. Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot me.

Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead.

<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to be Castor Troy? If you hesitate for a breath, you're finished! Now -- shoot me! Kill me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
Archer holds the gun unsteadily. Tito is disgusted.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do it... because Castor is tougher than you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's head. Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's still there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<HOAG>

	Let's see if I missed anything before I get my hands really dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAG>
<DIRECTION>
Archer removes the robe. He's amazed to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His own head on Castor's body: a flat stomach, hairy chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc. Hoag touches Archer's scar.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize this has to be removed.

INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, Castor beside him. Hoag turns to the video technician.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure you get everything -- I'll need to study the tape before the reverse surgery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAG>
<DIRECTION>
Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face. Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma- Induction-Device (D.I.D.) attaches via suction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the trigger. A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly slicing it. Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brodie and Miller watch from above. Tito stumbles into the nearby bathroom to throw up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<HOAG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vault it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOAG>
<DIRECTION>
Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor's consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize. Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castor's ear -- and we sense that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning.

INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

A head swathed in gauze. The bandages start to fall away.

<DIRECTION>
Tito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze. The patient looks into a mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jon Archer has become Castor Troy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he touches his new face. Archer stares... the cold reality chilling his blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's done to himself. For a moment, he seems to teeter on madness.
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon -- are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
Archer can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't comprehend. Finally he emerges... shaken, but in control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITO enters. Instinctively, he grabs for his holster.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... I'm okay.

<DIRECTION>
(etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches perfectly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing every muscle. He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes. Archer slowly turns to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor. Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile...
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?

Armed agents take their positions around a helipad. A jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry wasp.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELIPAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled "Castor." Two armed agents leap from the chopper and take charge of "Castor." He follows them pliantly, until --
</DIRECTION>
<TITO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite your nuts off if he gets the chance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<DIRECTION>
Archer gets the message. He starts to resist the agents and must be muscled into the chopper. He's manacled down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this very real point of departure. The CHOPPER DOOR SLAMS SHUT. It lifts off like a twister and SCREAMS away.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. HELIPORT - STAGING AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The watching team breaks up, wanders back to work.

The agent re-checks Archer's chains.

<ARCHER>

	Don't forget -- I ordered a kosher meal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The agent smashes his elbow into Archer's gut. The second agent presses an INJECTOR against Archer's leg. PSSSST. Archer spasms against the drug -- then sags unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EREWHON PRISON - DELOUSING CUBICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer lies gasping on the steel floor, protecting his face. The spray stops -- when head guard "RED" WALTON enters.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a citizen of nowhere. Human rights zealots, the Geneva convention and the P.C. police have no authority here. You have no right...

(slaps on latex gloves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I say your ass belongs to me -- I mean it. Bend over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's face reflects the degradation as he bends over and exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, Walton lets Archer dress. Another guard places a pair of odd-looking steel boots before Archer.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step into them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Archer inspects the lock-down boots. Hinged steel collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle. The soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't sniff 'em, you perv. Just step into them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Archer obeys. A guard squats down and locks the steel collars over Archer's shoes. He tries to move -- but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're too tight.

</ARCHER>
<WALTON>

Walton JOLTS Archer with his HIGH-VOLTAGE SHOCK-STICK.

Walton presses his thumb into a standard FBI scan-pad. It forms a print -- positively identifying the guard. The heavy blast-door automatically opens.

<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got fifty bucks says you're dead by dinner. Don't disappoint me.

Walton prods Archer toward the door. To Archer's surprise -- he can now move.

The inmates eat. Silence descends as Archer enters -- intensifying the constant HUMMING of the MAGNETIC FIELD. Huge Dubov does a slow burn on seeing "Castor."

Scanning the room for Pollux -- Archer takes a seat next to a LITTLE, GOATEED MAN with a French accent.

	Do I look wasted -- asshole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Voisine shakes his head "no" -- then his eyes widen as...

WHAM. Dubov leaps onto Archer and starts pummeling him. They slide across the table -- spilling everyone's lunch.

Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room. Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who watches uncertainly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready. He grabs Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never -- in -- the -- face.

</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov repeatedly in the groin. Metal boot meeting soft flesh.

Dubov staggers back -- hurt. Archer moves in for the kill, savoring it.

The two deputies react to Walton's call. Identifying Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the appropriate switches and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP! The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor. Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of reach.

Crack! Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm.

His statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs. Everyone does. From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's been accepted.

Castor's body lies inert. His life-support MACHINES BLIPPING away. Until the EEG spikes. Once -- twice -- three times. Brain wave activity increases -- and stabilizes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor's fingers twitch. Then his fist clenches -- hard. Castor's head is swathed in gauze. But his eyes pop open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out the tubes and wires that tether him to life support. He goes down -- in agony -- groaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window. He quickly unwraps the gauze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE... then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool.

<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I bet I kept that promise...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only one you've never broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort. Archer puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the trap.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw the past. We've got the future to look forward to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We still have tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit... five million bucks... now those Red Militia crackpots get to keep it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the worst part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's worse than losing five million bucks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows. What you built was a work of art. It belongs in the Smithsonian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- well... the L.A. Convention Center will have to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Pollux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Thanks'? I guess they really did fuck you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer. Without knowing exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer paces impatiently... as the door rolls open. Walton is looking at him with cool respect.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a visitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's timeliness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises. But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror. Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jon Archer. This man has Archer's face -- his real face.
</DIRECTION>
<IMPOSTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? Don't you like the new me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMPOSTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Archer studies the image of his former self -- trying to understand. Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he cannot say...
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Castor...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be. It's impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was 'titanically remote'. Who knows? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out. Or maybe God really is on my side after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts pacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Continuing to circle, he displays the current LA Times:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead"
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrible tragedy. Hoag was such a genius -- but selfish with his artistry. I actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I killed them, you dumb fuck. Hoag, his staff...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ON Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab. Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miller and Brodie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ON Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I even paid a visit to your buddy Tito.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't know anything about this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Jon. I think I know you better than that. I only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH ON Tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up Archer's wedding band off the counter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EREWHON PRISON (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now on Castor's finger.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- then again, I guess you were there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are. So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Castor, don't do this --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No discussion, Jon -- no deals. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, and a beautiful wife to fuck. Excuse me -- I mean 'make love to.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Archer freaks out. He screams, flails -- unable to reach Castor. Castor opens the door and guards rush in -- clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's quite all right. You never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL BLOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards dump Archer into his cell.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pollux is -- what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's been released...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walton, you have to listen to me -- right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or what? You'll have me fired?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pushes a button)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're confined until I say otherwise...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
The steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss: men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(sickened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, what a life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHER'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by. A moment later, it backs up and parks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile -- and gets out. She doesn't smile back.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry -- the job's been murder lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor looks her over -- she's much sexier than he expected.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happened to your 'important' assignment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you know about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know exactly what you always tell me: Absolutely nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't work out the way everyone thought it would. Where are you off to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got surgery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surgery -- are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Then he spots her medical bag. Oops.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try to charm me -- I'm still angry. There're leftovers in the fridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have fun at work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor kisses her good-bye -- on the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Castor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor steps inside, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a dump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past, studying the ones with photos. He's memorizing -- matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something else catches his eye. He finds a floral notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it. Then, he reads:
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'... "Date-night" has been a typical failure... we haven't made love in almost two months...' What a loser ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor hears a voice. Glancing across the hall, he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLIMPSES OF JAMIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped T-shirt. Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plot thickens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie stamps out her cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I got your E-mail, Karl. That poem was really sweet --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(spots Castor at door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on a sec...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
She slams it -- but he gets his foot inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Castor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not respecting my boundaries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming in, Janie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor pushes menacingly into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Janie'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow. He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you heard me... Jamie... You have something I want ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for her -- and right past her. He picks up a pack of cigarettes from the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarissa left those here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs and lights up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't tell mom if you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you start smoking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(blows a perfect smoke ring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy's a new man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie stares, astonished, as Castor goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EREWHON PRISON - ARCHER'S CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fists bloody, voice hoarse, Archer pounds at the cell door. Exhausted, he finally stops -- staring at the face of his enemy in the mirrored door -- the enemy who now has total command of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FBI - LOBBY CHECKPOINT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor dons his stern "Archer" face as the gate guard checks his thumbprint ID. He's cleared and waved in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FBI INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror. He's gorging himself on a big lunch. Castor arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, sir... we just want you to know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUZZ>
<WANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all really sorry about Tito...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WANDA>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, shit happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Buzz and Wanda exchange a glance. To them, "Archer" is just avoiding his feelings again.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's our star witness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hasn't told us a damn thing except what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUZZ>
<WANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that bomb is out there -- we're almost out of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WANDA>
<LAZARRO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARRO>
<DIRECTION>
Lazarro stomps toward them... furious. Buzz and Wanda quickly excuse themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<LAZARRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made a deal with Pollux Troy? He's 'a manipulative psychopath.' Your own words, Jon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARRO>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let me do my job, Victor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<LAZARRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The job I've been protecting for the last eight years. From now on, you go strictly by the book. Everything gets cleared by me. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARRO>
<DIRECTION>
Lazarro stomps off. Castor watches him go, wheels turning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor enters -- shutting down the mikes... and the blinds.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're supposed to be snitching -- making me look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Look good'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(drops food in disgust)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seeing that face -- I want to vomit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the one who has to look at this butt-ugly mug every time I pass a mirror. Look at my eyes, my chin, my perfect nose -- gone!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(considers his reflection)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archer took my life, so I'm taking his. Bro, I'm going straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like they took your brain, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar Hoover. Carlos the Jackal running Interpol. Kaddafi heading the Mossad. Think of the secrets we could sell...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The drug agents we could expose. The movie stars we could blackmail!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just the bottom of the food chain. Pollux -- what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force One?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... that somebody would get rich. And, I suppose, the nation would be pretty pissed-off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking for someone to step in, take charge, give them hope again. What if that someone was an F.B.I. hero? A true Boy Scout and family man -- with a spotless past. Imagine where that guy could land -- if the timing's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<POLLUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an audacious dream, Caz. But Jon Archer is hardly a household name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet he isn't. But after you 'confess' -- you'll be a free man. And I'll be on my way...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

Police VEHICLES ROAR into position. Squads of police evacuate throngs of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENTION CENTER - SUB-BASEMENT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TICKS down to less than two minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the bomb's casing. Inside, the complex guts glow evilly. The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their league.
</DIRECTION>
<BOMB_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus... Any suggestions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOMB_LEADER>
<TECHNICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... run
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Castor pushes up his blast visor. He looks grim.
</DIRECTION>
<BOMB_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's protected by a vibration detector... One touch and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOMB_LEADER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evacuate your team, Captain.

</CASTOR>
<BOMB_LEADER>

	Sir, you can't disarm it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOMB_LEADER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The bomb squad hustles out. Waiting until he's alone, Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its switch. The bomb's glow dies instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops at 26 seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not satisfied, Castor starts it up again -- running the timer down to four seconds. That's better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EREWHON PRISON - "POPULATION" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inmates eat lunch. Walton enters -- prodding a beaten Jon Archer ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A special privilege today: TV -- by order of Agent Jon Archer of the F.B.I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
Jeers from the inmates as the big screen changes from the nature loop to... CNN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN - CONVENTION CENTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Sweating," Castor lumbers out, carrying the disarmed bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<ANCHORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the scene at the L.A. Convention Center, where an F.B.I. agent is being hailed as a hero. Agent Jon Archer disarmed a powerful bomb just seconds before it was set to explode. Let's get the latest from Valerie Rice...

</ANCHORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Castor basks in the attention of the gathered media.

	The apparent target was a group of Supreme Court justices -- due to speak here today.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Archer, do you have any idea who planted it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_RICE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's classified. But if he's listening I have a message for him:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try. Now you know who's really in charge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching the TV, Archer's enraged, frustrated. Then his eyes focus... he watches closely as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guard uses his "thumbprint ID" to get through the security door. Archer's eyes fall on the thumbprint scan pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor gets a "thumbs up" from some co-workers, others smile -- but they know better than to applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you guys watch TV? Where's the parade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other -- afraid. But proud rookie Loomis starts clapping, so everyone else joins in rousing applause.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda... all of you, thanks from the bottom of my heart. Thanks for enduring all those years I was an insufferable boor. From now on -- consider me reborn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<WANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop the presses -- Jon Archer found a personality...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Wild applause... interrupted by an excited Kim.
</DIRECTION>
<KIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir... the White House is calling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIM>
<DIRECTION>
Castor acts startled... as if at a loss. Then he struts toward his office -- pausing only to give Kim a playful swat on the rump. She's stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor surveys his new domain. He settles into Archer's big leather chair... sees a framed photo of Archer and family. He apes Archer's dumb posed smile...
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon, your career is finally taking of.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archer. Sure I'll hold...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting, he picks up a handbook: You and the FBI: A Primer for New Employees. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, what an honor...

</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor pumps a "whacking off" gesture with his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor, carrying grocery bags, comes into the back yard where Jamie practices free throws. He watches her miss.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a game of horse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me beat your butt again, Dad. It's harmful to my developing psyche.

</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid you'll lose?

Castor crisply sinks a free-throw. Jamie glares, takes the ball -- and tosses an air-ball.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'H.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie sneers at him. He buries another one.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try putting a higher arc on the ball... and square your shoulders to the basket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Begrudgingly, she listens -- and sinks a clean shot. Pleased, she nods. HONK! A BMW pulls into the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta go. Karl's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie trots over to greet KARL (17) -- a clean-cut preppie. Opening the car door dor her, Karl waves, smiling at Castor. Castor studies Karl carefully, not liking what he sees.
</DIRECTION>

Uh-oh. Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes. He leans in "romantically" -- but we know the real reason.

<CASTOR>

He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin. She's aroused, but wary. So Castor goes in for the kill.

Archer is dumped on the floor. He sees he's lying in a puddle of something. He looks up -- and recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHER'S POV - DUBOV

is strapped to a vertical gurney -- post-procedure. His limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a mako shark's. But his feet are bare -- bootless.

<MED_TECH>

Walton muscles Archer into the gurney. The Med-Tech smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<MED_TECH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh happy day -- Castor Troy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MED_TECH>
<DIRECTION>
The Med-Tech wheels the ECT head-gear cart into place: twin needle-like BOLTS ready to fit into ARCHER'S ears. A single blue static spark jumps from the bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton roughly wedges Archer's head into the head gear, shoving the chewed-up bite strap into Archer's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll be gumming baby food from here on out.

</WALTON>
<MED_TECH>

	Get his boots, Sergeant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MED_TECH>
<DIRECTION>
Walton unlocks Archer's first boot and pulls it off. As the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archer's arm -- Walton unlocks and pulls off the second boot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's feet are free. Crack! He yanks his foot up hard -- Walton reels back, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One arm still restrained, Archer backrolls in the gurney and kicks the head-gear cart away -- knocking it into the Med-Tech who collapses onto it, hitting "Test" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZAP! The HEAD-BOLTS FIRE, catching the Med-Tech through the shoulder -- he drops to the floor, his synapses shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing that Archer is still restrained by the arm -- the assistant darts out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Archer pulls free -- Walton looms over him -- gun poised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- wham! Dubov wallops Walton -- using his boots as brass knuckles. The head guard collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dubov smiles dumbly at Archer -- all trace of vendetta now obliterated. Archer nods gratefully -- they're on the same team... at least for now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the ALARM BLARES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer sees guards charging the room. He tries closing the door -- but the guards arrive. Dubov lumbers over and puts his massive weight into it -- and slams the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O.S., guards POUND at the now-locked door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer quickly frisks Walton -- coming up with a cigarette lighter. he pockets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scanning around -- Archer leaps onto a mounted, hinged lamp. it swings against the wall. Archer uses it to reach the catwalk above.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dubov -- come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dubov obeys and follows Archer up onto the catwalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A groggy Walton muscles open the door from inside. Guards pour in. Walton grabs an AUTO-RIFLE and opens FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLUGS chase Archer and Dubov as they flee through the catwalk door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CENTRAL SECURITY CONTROL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the clinic's monitor. They grab their shock-sticks and rush for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer. Perfectly in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards. Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks out wires and shatters the computers. Dubov mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console -- and revealing a narrow cable duct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the DRONING HUM RISES -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous surge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND PRISON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos. Guards scatter as the huge diamond-vision SCREEN EXPLODES and inmates are flung like rag-dolls by their short-circuiting boots. Anything metallic flies into the magnetic domes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SECURITY CENTRAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the men back through the cable duct -- Archer struggles to replace the heavy console.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR is BLOWN open. Walton enters to find... no one. Then his eyes light on the console -- slightly askew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABLE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Dubov rush down the tight corridor -- and around the bend. The corridor ends in a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORAGE/MAINTENANCE AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lined with tools, toilets, sinks, a rack of old lock-down boots. They race through the far door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CENTRAL TOWER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level labyrinth. A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with catwalks, staircases and high walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER -- they seem to be coming from all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall. He pulls one screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHEER WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal boots. They climb higher and higher as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and around them -- oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when...
</DIRECTION>
<WALTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTON>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and Dubov reach the next catwalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far end. But four guards descend on them -- and block their way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking guards. Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more guards. Dubov drops another over the catwalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continue their desperate race for the door -- reaching the landing. As BULLETS PING around them -- hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel. He uses it as a shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses his thumb to the door's keypad. To his horror, its LED reads "print unreadable."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer range.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS. The shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly disintegrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer licks his thumb, tries again. Finally it reads "Clearance Confirmed"... the door slides open.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but as he turns to follow... Walton BLOWS him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled inmate ignores the helping hand. Pulling the door shut, he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH CATWALK TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer hesitates for a moment... but that's all he has. he keeps going... up the winding staircase-catwalk -- higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top. He ignores a sign which reads...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY. SAFETY LINES REQUIRED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He charges straight up a ladder and plows right through --

EXT. PRISON - DAWN

Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world.

A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the bird...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer rushes over to a transport chopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer searches for the keys. No go. He throws switches. Nothing works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING. Archer leaps from the chopper and jumps over the side to the platform's --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWER LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and rolls to the ground. He grabs a high-pressure hose -- and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards close in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON -- knocking Walton and others into the sea. Archer upends a stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards. Archer spots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUGBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail -- where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back. Under FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean. At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHOPPY SEA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls himself into the ZODIAC and frees it from the tug. It ROARS off.

Archer senses something... He looks up and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whoosh! Something swoops down -- but it's just a pelican.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He FIDDLES with the ENGINE -- which finally DIES. Archer grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another swoop! This time it's the prison chopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor. An idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper settles over the Zodiac.

Wind and water swirl around Archer...

Walton, drenched but obviously rescued, has archer in his sights... He starts to FIRE his MACHINE GUNS...

BULLETS RAIN down on the boat -- destroying it -- as Archer dives into the rolling swells...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Walton RAKES the debris -- shredding it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage... then moves off... its ROTOR WASH THRASHING the buoy.

Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking air.

It's beautiful here, striking and sad. Now on foot, Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.

Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone. Castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone:

Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.

</ARCHER>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, just listen! Take Jamie and go to your mother's in Santa Fe. Don't tell him where you're going -- just go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever you are -- don't call again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. Archer sags in futility. A SIREN snaps him back to reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A squad CAR ROARS INTO VIEW -- then continues on its way.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to speak to Director Lazarro immediately... I have information about Castor Troy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting... Archer rifles the room... finding car keys... a baggy jacket... Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FBI OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Jon Archer. Who's calling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Archer pauses... hearing his own voice speaking to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you're Jon Archer... I guess this must be Castor Troy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've gotta hand it to you, Jon. You're doing a damn respectable job of being me. But let's face it, we both liked it better the way it was. So before the cops blow your brains out -- why not tell me where you are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were really me, you'd know -- no discussion, no deals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick. The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out. He doesn't get far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLO_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLO_1>
<CHOLO_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten bucks he's the guy who popped Tito!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLO_2>
<DIRECTION>
The Cholos surround the Buick. Archer's cornered like an animal as the angry teens pound on the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer HITS the GAS -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who jumps on the hood. Archer SLAMS the BRAKES -- sending the guy flying. He lands hard, but is only shaken up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOLO_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	9-1-1? I want to report a stolen car and don't put me on hold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOLO_1>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. BUICK - MOVING - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Archer drives on -- listening to KFWB.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... the escapee is considered extremely dangerous. If you have any information concerning the whereabouts of Castor Troy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
He SHUTS it OFF as he sees in the distance:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS OWN HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FBI and LAPD vehicles are parked in front. No way he's getting near there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car approaching. He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly cruises by.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Jon... you have to think like Castor. Where would he go...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Archer gets an idea. But as he drives on -- the cop car backs up -- and reappears INTO FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MELROSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery. He gets in his Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. STREET - LEXUS - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team swarming all over Tito's parked Buick. Dietrich quickly averts his face as he spots... "Jon Archer" inspecting Tito's Buick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's in big trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from someplace and jerks around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into the barrel of Dietrich's pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, Castor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive. And punch up your cellular -- I need you to make some calls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna get me busted!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're already busted, Dietrich. It's just a matter of time before they pick you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, when you came to me about that bomb -- I knew I should have blown you off... but that's my fucking curse -- I just can't say no to a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't say no to money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my other curse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low- rent streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo, Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and listens as the DOORBELL RINGS. He screws up his courage.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Castor Troy... This is your old crew -- you don't take shit and you don't take no for an answer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous, in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helluva place, Dietrich. So what's the big surprise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Archer emerges. The men are stunned -- the women beam.
</DIRECTION>
<FITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? You're going to bring the Feds down on all of us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FITCH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archer doesn't want you, he wants me! But I'm going to get him first -- with your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<ALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Archer's a damn celebrity now -- he's untouchable -- and you're radioactive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALDO>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to leave. Archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall. Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's too quick -- he strips him of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround Archer.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna face-off with Castor Troy? Come on, then! Come on! 'Cause I've had a real bad day...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer. One-by-one, the bodyguards back off. Archer points the gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all forgetting who the real enemy is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Aldo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled you in for questioning. He rattled you so bad -- you shit your Armani suit right there in the interrogation room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that? Fitch laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer laughed at your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all have a reason to hate Jon Archer. We all want to see him dead --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And nobody's untouchable if we say he's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The thugs exchange a glance... reading each other... considering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all worked out. Caz has Archer's routine down cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We start with your basic kidnapping. Then -- a little surgery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<FITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surgery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FITCH>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to rearrange his face in a way you won't believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<ALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an evil bitch, Caz. But you've got balls of titanium. Count us in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALDO>
<DIRECTION>
Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on -- let's drink to it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high- ball glass filled with mescal. he hands it to Archer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about one of your famous toasts, Caz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<DIRECTION>
They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh -- blow jobs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Silence -- then they crack up. Reluctantly, Archer swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge to puke.
</DIRECTION>
<LIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough business, Caz. Let's dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIVIA>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
She drags him onto the glass floor. Cindee puts on some MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin. The girls start "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies. He tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.
</DIRECTION>
<LIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember the Charger's game, Caz? The owners box? We did it four times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIVIA>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I remember... Once a quarter, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.
</DIRECTION>
<LIVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caz? Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIVIA>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIETRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When even Castor Troy can't handle a tab of Quantrex...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raises his glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That, dear friends, is the first sorry whiff of old age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIETRICH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily. Woozy, he takes a breath... and notices a reflection in the window above the sink. Archer turns to see -- Sasha.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Sasha Hassler. Age 35. Met Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at Pearl Jam reunion...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catches himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, how you doing, baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
She responds by slapping him -- hard.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be dead...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
He wobbles, then falls flat on his face. Out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHER'S HOME - BALCONY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor's chain-smoking, looking out over the city -- wondering where Archer might be hiding. But something breaks his rumination. He sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BMW pulls up to the curb. The THUMPING MUSIC from within GOES QUIET, but no one emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe distance. He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Karl, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father -- he's got a gun -- he'll -- he'll --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<KARL>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls open belt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wimp won't do shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! The passenger WINDOW EXPLODES inward. Castor drags Karl out by his hair. Jamie scrambles out and flees toward the house as...
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you to call Jon Archer a wimp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING it. Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind the wheel. The Beemer lurches away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor enters to find Jamie, still shaken up.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you -- stupid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just like you. Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it look like I was siding with him? Did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she falls silent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to play with scummy organ grinders, you better be prepared. Do you have protection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean like... condoms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean like... protection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
With a fluid motion, Castor expertly SNAPS open a well- oiled SWITCHBLADE and hands it to an astonished Jamie.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time -- slip it in low, then twist it -- so the wound doesn't close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs him tight -- taking Castor by surprise. But he responds momentarily. About to pat her rump -- something makes him stop.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie kisses him and heads up stairs. After she's gone...
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No wonder he spent all his time chasing me. Who can deal with this family shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS. He rushes to the den and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon Archer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(immediately alert)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOFT - ACROSS STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close her drapes. Visible in the b.g. on the sofa -- is Archer.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
(into cell phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I thought he might visit some old friends of yours. And bro, if I didn't know better -- I'd swear this guy likes being you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLLUX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer wakens. Sasha is tugging off his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh -- can't we just talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk? The only talk I ever heard from you was 'take it off,' 'sit on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on him.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off the rest of those rags and get dressed. Then get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not until I finish my business with your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him to keep those creeps away -- but you're just too big an attraction.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calming herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if the F.B.I. finds out you've been here -- I'll lose my son. So please, just go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother. And he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I've done some things that made your life harder...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you? You walked out and never looked back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling Sasha's deep-seated anger. Archer finishes dressing.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not the same person you remember. And for what it's worth, I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a bad fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They should. They're yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice-looking kid, too
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam, come here... I want you to meet your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's face pales over in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their silhouettes are visible against the shades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(into cellular)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUZZ>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. Remember -- shoot to kill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue."
</DIRECTION>
<BUZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard the man -- let's saddle up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUZZ>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five. No one knows you're his father. I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bang! Bang! Bang!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at them. Upset, she takes it from his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Mommy doesn't like you playing with these things...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to Archer. Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body.
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not holding him right... Caz...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Archer isn't hearing Sasha. He's lost in his own memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER... a GUNSHOT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled. It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something strong. He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he is -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest second.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER.

Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the floor as the kitchen is decimated by GUNFIRE...

SASHA'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward the door. He's almost out when...
</DIRECTION>
<SASHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SASHA>
<DIRECTION>
Her wail of fear freezes Archer. He looks back -- and sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's face betrays his conflict. A child -- but his worst enemy's child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam. Getting closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the shattered windows, his weapon poised. Archer kicks him hard, pitching him back through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body. Thinking fast, he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face. Protecting him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes to Sasha. Together, they barrel through the soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRING out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by an agent as he CRASHES through the WINDOW.

Cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver. He FIRES -- BLASTING Cindee into the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWER LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer hustles Sasha and Adam toward the staircase when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT DOOR

ARCHER, SASHA AND ADAM

Dietrich, et al, open FIRE down on the attacking agents. Agents drop or are driven back out.

Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in his clenching grip. He hurls it into other Archer family memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs.

Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest. He pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his heart -- until it finally seizes up.

Lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the ground.
</DIRECTION>

Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal. He checks his watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarro's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door flies open -- and two medics rush in. They see Castor vigorously pumping Lazarro's chest -- "applying" CPR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The medics gently nudge Castor aside. One medic takes Lazarro's pulse, then shakes his head.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY

Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedestrians gawk at this madman. What's he doing?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store. He swings the trash can. SMASH! The store's WINDOW SHATTERS. An ALARM BLARES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned. Then several youths leap into the window and start pulling merchandise out of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb. A cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver stands at his door, radio in hand. Sensing something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer sprays him in the face. The cop gags and sags. Archer quickly slips behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside: Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside. He HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.

Archer slows the squad car.
</DIRECTION>

Up ahead: Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic.

A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO.

Archer approaches the bird feeder. Quietly, he sticks his hand inside -- and searches for the key.

MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing the bed. He stops. On top of the rumpled covers: Eve's nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs.

Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has stopped. Eve steps in from the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eve...

The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality. She runs, but Archer grabs her. She struggles -- fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her mouth covered.

THFFFT! The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the barrel.

FOLLOW DART

Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide. It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during the 21-GUN SALUTE.
</DIRECTION>

ON KNOLL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUMP! Archer is cracked across the head. He slumps down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear. As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we don't know when, or if, this pistol fires...

</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say goodbye to Daddy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>

Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTOR

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking for --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by their suntanned crews. He jumps into one of the boats.
</DIRECTION>
<BOAT_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOAT_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead. In a flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT. He sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTOR'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRES -- peppering the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him. Archer rolls into the boat -- FIRING.

<DIRECTION>
Castor's hit! A slug grazes his shoulder. He grabs the THROTTLE -- taking off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit. Castor BLASTS back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CIVILIAN BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER at point-blank range. Their boats smash and pound each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A police boat closes in on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and boat. The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's craft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other. EXPLOSION! Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat lands right next to Castor's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulling a barge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor forces Archer into its path. At the last moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM! Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the boat hits a wave...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor loses the gun -- which skids away. Archer slips, his head hanging over the side. Castor tries to ram Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it. WHUNK! It sinks into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain. Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings. But as they slug it out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS straight for the shipyard. COLLIDING with a shoreline obstruction --
</DIRECTION>

The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir. Castor sees the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it. But --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer gets it first. He aims it at Castor as they rise.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't shoot me, Jon. I'm unarmed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I have a confession to make... but you aren't gonna like it... You're right, I won't shoot you. Not in the face anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest! He jerks and reels -- dropping to his knees. He looks at Archer in total disbelief. Then he sinks to the ground and lies still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop. Then he turns and sees an FBI chopper heading his way. Relieved, he turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw. Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the leg. He buckles... but keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade.
</DIRECTION>
<CASTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll never be over, Jon... every time you look in the mirror... you'll see my face...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASTOR>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer, closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek. At the last instant...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer reaches the anchor-chain. He wraps it around the screw -- stopping the whirling blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his wedding ring. Just when he almost has it off -- Castor suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye contact between the two men. Castor smirks, his grasp slackening... as he finally fades away. Archer lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
The chopper lands. Buzz and Wanda rush over.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell. Eve is at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at the front screen door -- a man's silhouette.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Eve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Pulse pounding, Eve frantically pushes open the door to glimpse the face of the man with Archer's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Jon Archer. Eve stares -- then touches his face carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar. Then, she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie is there. Archer smiles -- gently, almost sadly -- with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could never feel, could never fake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rushes to him. The whole family hangs on, hugging and kissing -- for the first time ever, really together.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I shot you, Dad. Am I grounded?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something to ask you -- to ask both of you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
He steps aside -- revealing Castor's son.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Adam. He needs a place to live... just for a little while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Archer stands up -- revealing Castor's face in the bathroom mirror. Eve chokes back a scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archer turns and faces her -- with his true face. He sees her terrified expression, turns back to the mirror -- and sees his own face looking at him. But he understands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He embraces Eve... holds her tight. She responds, happy to have him home again. We STAY ON his familiar smile and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
