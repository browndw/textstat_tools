INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab we hear the sounds of the airport: the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings. Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair. His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hotel Mondial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Le Mondial. Tres bien.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts driving.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment. L'autoroute est ferme. A cause du 14 Juillet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He drives for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind the radio?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away. He also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du Bois.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to turn the radio off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing he's being asked a question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't speak French.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
The driver turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(in broken English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. American?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good because I speak a little English.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked if you mind the radio. Music. You know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed shakes his head "no".
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Super cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed adjusts his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time, time, time. I don't know. Daytime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed forgets the adjustment for now.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you in town for business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a nice hotel. Your hotel. Very big rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know Paris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been here once before. When I was younger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
The cab driver smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those were the days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
They drive for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then after thinking about it for a while)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you need a wife for the night...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(searching for the right words in French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Une escorte. Pour vous faire visiter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then back to his broken English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For business. I give you my number. Very nice girl. French. Like when you were young.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together, then he crosses them.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed smiles at this and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaks the language of love. Take you to heaven and back. You just tell me and I set it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed shakes his head and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you laughing at? You let Moises set it up. She treat you right. She treat you fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel. From around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, walks into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and proceeds to show him the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(in broken English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your package...It arrived in the last night of before last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah...telephone, for the room service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He motions toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The toilet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hang the clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a control console next to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From here you can operate the television.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, he starts fingering through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which bills to give him.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(after getting what he wanted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merci.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
The bellboy turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<BELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures moins dix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, and takes a seat on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package. Before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in. Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package. Inside of it is a black steel briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the bedside table we see Zed's watch. It reads 12:10 P.M. Next to it is the phone. Next to the phone is a piece of folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads: 45.63.53.37.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his face and cascade down his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits some out with a spurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the shower off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower. He makes his way toward the knocking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped around his waist. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than twenty. She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bonjour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(a little awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bonjour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Zed opens up the door and lets her in. She checks out the room and places her bag on the bed. Then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure. Toute la nuit pour 700. D'avance. Et faudra porter un--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...don't speak French.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
She blows a bubble.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a seat on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be one thousand francs for all night. In advance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can do it now if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let me just dry up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but it's not necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console. A French talk show comes on. She changes the channel until she comes to a station playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu". She smiles and sits back to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZED(O.S.) (from the bathroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
ZED(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Zed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling at this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny. We both have Z names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair. His pants are on.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
She notices his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can take those off. The pants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather watch you get undressed first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(matter-of-factly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up and starts to lift her top off. He stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
He lays down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there looking at him and then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright Mister America. Zed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow enough for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She removes the pants and climbs on top of him. They begin to make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp. An IMAGE overcomes her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'etait formidable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They rest there for a while...holding each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moises told me you were in town for business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'm just curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ask all your clients questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Just the ones I like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're...a good person. I run into some real creeps. You know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know I'm a good person?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Body language. We fit together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All men and women fit together. Hell, even some men fit together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but you know, we clicked. You made me orgasm. Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Usually never. They're almost always fat like pigs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed laughs at this.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you make me feel safe. That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never really thought of it like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed nods at this.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn off the television.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I like you too Zoe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? For the same reason? Any man can orgasm. Even with his own hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I like your honesty. You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't like the sound of this. She slaps him.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not a prostitute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is a little surprised at this.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Can I have my francs back then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a student. And to pay for the classes I became an escort. It's my choice to sleep with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it's not easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here because I want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay relax. What school do you go to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Centre du Art, Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's really interesting. What kind of art do you study?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not any of the old shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a day job too. Three times a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But someday there will be only my art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of things do you paint?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't paint. I make things. Objects. Not like sculpture. Like life...but with no narrative. I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world. Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny. Those are left for me. They belong only to me. If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine. I have failed. And I would destroy it. I don't care how much cash they would offer me. It would be shit. I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed. They told too much about me. And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself. The way I'm telling you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I do I do only for the objects.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to see one of these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? So you could see the work of a whore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute. I didn't understand the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable. Perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I do...you'll never know which one it is. Because I'll be the only one who understands. I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is unable to speak. They look into each others eyes for a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in through the window. Then she leans forward and gives him a soft understanding kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is asleep. Zoey is asleep in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knocking at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knock becomes a pound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed gets up and puts on his pants. Zoey gets up and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(groggily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea. Night time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
There is more pounding on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to take a shower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age wearing baggy French-style clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in. The room itself is a general mess. A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor. Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" poster.

Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

The kitchen is an absolute pig stye. Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter.

Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it. He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass.

Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric's bed has probably never been made. In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment. But, there is a certain order to all this chaos. Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>

	But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day. Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.

<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, only one person can start the alarm.

	The concierge, at this desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

He points to the main floor vault.

<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>

He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can get into this vault in half an hour. Maybe less.

</ZED>
<ERIC>

	But this entry way is too small to get the platen out. We have a lot of merchandise in there.

</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, don't you see? We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault. From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes.

	No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Claude laugh at this.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jean snorts a line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude offers Zed the spliff. Zed shakes his head "no".
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering from the snort)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed. Francois sits on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric rolls up his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ricardo in French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then to Zed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My vein is like a rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes. Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood. It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He withdraws the needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricardo lets go of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is in bliss. His eyes roll back into his head. He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jean takes another snort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try some. It's called chasing the dragon. The Chinese have been doing it for centuries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but you must. It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face. They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter. Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

<DIRECTION>
FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris weaving in and out of traffic. Next to him is Oliver, and in the back seat is Zed and Eric. They're giving the very stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car speeds up next to them. In it is Francois, and Claude, with Jean driving. They are racing with Ricardo through the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting away on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. That's Notre Dame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
But before Zed can even look it has past by.
</DIRECTION>
<RICARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like French cars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICARDO>
<DIRECTION>
All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 kilometers per hour. He tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(answering Enrique's question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<RICARDO>

</RICARDO>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>

Zed is in too much of a blur. He leans over to Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is tomorrow really Bastille day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history. And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo.

</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.

EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.

INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is they're going to.
</DIRECTION>

Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster, faster...go faster. Let's beat them!

Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.

INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.

<ERIC>

</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric takes a big hit.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves. Do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
No, Zed doesn't see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is good to have you here. We could not do this without you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone has agreed to give you double shares. That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed nods, delirious.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I have AIDS. From the needle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed can't believe this. He's not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Then Eric sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
They take a sharp turn.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar. Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club. Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a BAND is playing away. In the audience sit about TWELVE FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BUFFET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it. Behind the tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and JOSEPHINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle and Josephine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric hands them some money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZED'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club. Oliver sits next to Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how long have you known Eric?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Eric's mother is American.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and his dad's French.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're divorced. And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up. So every six months he would come back to the states. We were best friends. Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It's been...years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's good to have you here. Eric speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...I suppose. I used to be, when I was young.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh they're the best. Helmets with horns on them. Shit. That's fucking genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout Toy Jazz? You like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love it. It's really good, you know? Like real music. It has a heart and culture all it's own. It's, like, jazz for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hungry cannibals'd like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He pours Zed a glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver passes on the wine.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>

(to Zed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fucking English.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Zed sips some. He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE AUDIENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats then right in front of everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZED'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Zed notices something...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZED'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed blinks but it's true.

Oliver and Claude start laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at him. He's crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The set is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue Soufflot is bustling.

<DIRECTION>
Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in Eric's car. The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states.

</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came. That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I resist your invitation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would have been stupid to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what have you been doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy. And then I bummed around. You know. For fun. For a while I worked at Le Figaro. The newspaper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like terrorists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>

Zed looks over at him.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where Eric's flat is. On the top landing there is a dead cat laying. Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people next door are on holiday. We took their phone. If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.

</ERIC>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that cat dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I think it's asleep but it's been there for days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric gives it a kick. No response.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
They walk into the flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in. The room itself is a general mess. A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor. Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" poster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting at the table playing cards are three men: FRANCOIS, RICARDO, and JEAN.

Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE and OLIVER.

They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it. He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy. Don't scare him. He just wants to claim you.

Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder.

The monkey screeches.

Oliver sits down next to Claude.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric's bed has probably never been made. In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment. But, there is a certain order to all this chaos. Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ask me where we got this.

</ERIC>
<ZED>

He places his hand on the blueprint.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day. Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, only one person can start the alarm.

<DIRECTION>
(he hands it to Zed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The concierge, at this desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points it out on the blueprint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will take care of him. Then we can close the bank. No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(turning the schematic around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh! He's right next to the door. We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him. Don't worry about that.

</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the main floor vault.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. This is where they keep the days reserve cash. Okay fuck that.

</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

	There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into. This is where the real prize is.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>

He checks the blueprint.

</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well shit. It's too long. We have to be in and out.

<DIRECTION>
(he snaps his fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like that. Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and...

He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water. Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>

He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle. Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean. Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette. Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want heroin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jean and Claude laugh at this.

</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jean snorts a line.

Claude offers Zed the spliff. Zed shakes his head "no".

Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing.

Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed. Francois sits on the floor.

Eric rolls up his sleeve.

(then to Zed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My vein is like a rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes. Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood. It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He withdraws the needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricardo lets go of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is in bliss. His eyes roll back into his head. He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jean takes another snort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try some. It's called chasing the dragon. The Chinese have been doing it for centuries.

	Oh, but you must. It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.

They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face. They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter. Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke.

Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown.

Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician.

</RICARDO>
<DIRECTION>
Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.
</DIRECTION>
<RICARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The day finally came for his release. He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town. Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, "I wanna eat some pussy."

Jean is already laughing.

Zoey glances at all of the people. Then her eyes lock with the concierge security guard.

	"Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I want it now!"

The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.

<RICARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "I'll see what I can do." So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. "She's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.

Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it. His fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it.

<RICARDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After a little while, he came across a piece of egg. "That's funny," he thought to himself, "I don't think I had egg for breakfast." But he spat it out and kept eating away. Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth. "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn. "What is this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be sick."

The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety. Zoey knows he's going to make his move.

Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the .38 and fires three shots.

Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest. He falls to the ground.

The other hits Francois in the arm.

</ERIC>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(starting out calm and then building to a scream)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eric...there's no fucking way out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh but you're wrong. This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass. You find your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching. Eric drops the gun but quickly whips out his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoey falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They rush out toward the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see how she ran? Did you see how she ran? She doesn't care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy. Look out for number one. What do you say Zed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
He swipes again.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will kill you. And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here. I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS...if she doesn't already have it. What do you say to that Zed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric reaches for the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair. She plunges her nails into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed lets out a shrill scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room. His body is a mass of bullet wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ox! Where is thy yoke!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near Zoey, Zed, and Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman could posses. He rolls over and throws Zoey off him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric turns back to them.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
He aims to kill Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<ZOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOEY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs. At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH_POLICEMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH_POLICEMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Eric stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It becomes quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun kick.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I give you little kiss. Ciao.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes the trigger and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police open fire with their French made assault machine guns and fill Eric with bullets. Instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An IMAGE overcomes Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoey runs up to him and holds him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police all charge into the secondary vault area and secure the downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zoey is crying as she holds Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police have their guns aimed at the two of them.

Zoey looks up.

They take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if he's okay.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH_POLICEMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bad do you think his wounds are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH_POLICEMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
The other policeman, unable to tell because of Eric's blood, simply shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH_POLICEMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zoey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
