He lights the blunt. Craig's watching, so is Suga. Uncle Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time. Maybe too long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke (cough with your mouth closed). And toke. And toke. And toke. It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a big puff of smoke. Then he starts to cough, and cough, and cough out of control.
