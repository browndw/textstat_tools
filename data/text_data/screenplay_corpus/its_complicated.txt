EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND JAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50 is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this woman's appearance screams "solid."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks, his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his glass of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy happy happy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(reminding him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Anniversary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some things never change.

</JAKE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.

</SALLY>
<JANE>

	I thought maybe you were drifting.

</JANE>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was pausing.

</TED>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs, raising his glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy... Anniversary. You two have led an extraordinarily blessed life. As long as I've known you both, you've always managed to somehow do everything entirely right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- That's so true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, honestly, how can it be thirty years!?! When did we do that trip to Spain?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was for both of our what..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Fifteenth anniversaries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, that was a great trip...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21 YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver puts his arm around his Mom.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ollie, how was graduation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was fantastic. I can't believe I'm not in school anymore. When's Luke's graduation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next week.

</JAKE>
<TED>

	Are the girls going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can't wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long is Luke home before he has to go back for work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Only a week... SALLY Aw, that's it? JANE I know, I hate it. Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Agness joins the group, standing next to Jake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congrats again...

(puts down her champagne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great party...

</OLIVER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I have some

<DIRECTION>
(Agness hands Jake a piece
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	of cake. Jane works hard at not appearing
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- stuff I have to get done tonight for work...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jake & Agness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you two in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AGNESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNESS>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Well....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AGNESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Jane, what are you wearing to the graduation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNESS>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, a suit or dress, probably a suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AGNESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fancy. Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNESS>
<DIRECTION>
Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you there, Janey. Where are you staying again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're at The Park Regent. You said you were at The Four Seasons, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Agness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JAKE>
<AGNESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're at The Park Regent too. JANE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hates this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Good. That'll be convenient, actually. Okay, so, see you soon..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(waves awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'll walk you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<AGNESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Ted, do you think you can help us get Pedro into El Montecito for kindergarten?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNESS>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was sweet how well you and Jake were getting along. Felt like old times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, we know how to do this by now. It has been ten years.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness affectionately rubbing Jake's back.

<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD GABBY in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child. But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your mother. We are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of vegetables dot the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and has an air of maturity about her.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabby, stop...you're never going to fit all this in... you can come back for the rest tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREN>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't come back t---
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God...that's all my clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(sets the suitcase down as
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	he sees an SUV heading to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the house)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, your Mom is home. She'll figure this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabby, you're leaving now? I thought you were going in the morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know but my friends are all there and they wanted me to come tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But honey, it's gonna get dark soon. You can't see out the back window. It's Saturday night. People will be on the road drinking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<LAUREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, she'll be there in a couple of hours, she'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREN>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here. I'll be back for it in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to drive it down in the morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Gabby's BLACKBERRY

<BUZZES_she_laughs>
<DIRECTION>
thumbs flying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be there by lunch. We could go to that big Bed, Bath, and Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby, can you look up from that thing??
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<GABBY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it covered, Ma.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harley)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey gangsta, help me carry these...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(exhausted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house. Jane seems worried as she watches them.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUREN>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you....? No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Lauren looks doubtful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'm not! One of you is always moving out...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Gabby re-joins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I am wondering who I'm gonna watch The Hills with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<GABBY>
<DIRECTION>
(huge hug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard. Harley joins the group.
</DIRECTION>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walks to her car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, you don't happen to know where Dad is, do you? I tried calling him to say goodbye...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was at Sally and Ted's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was? How was that? You and them at the same --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jane turns to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- not that it's in any way, any of my... was just...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It was....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(notices both girls wait for her answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- whatever. It was fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was her lunatic child there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this time. Gabby, call me when you get there. Do NOT forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Gabby texts, deep in convo )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabby!
	</DIALOGUE>
<GABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. I'll call you! LAUREN Knock `em dead, little one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And call us when you get there, too. And no texting and driving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and starts off.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(puts his arm around Jane's shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They grow up so friggin' fast. I hate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should get a dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Goodbye you two. Love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(heading for their car and
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	getting into the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
passenger seat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love you boss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Lauren and Harley drive off, Jane turns and looks at her suddenly very empty nest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years. Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen. The Kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses, allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass- through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reynaldo...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods to the muffins)
</DIRECTION>
<REYNALDO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too much sugar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNALDO>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little bit. Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter. Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of coffee with lids.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who wants coffee while they're waiting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly to a Young Employee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check on table five, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(all smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He holds rolled blueprints.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, I can't remember, have you ever met Adam Schaeffer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs awkwardly )
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what we've got. ADAM
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(raises the blueprints)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So excited!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S SMALL OFFICE - UPSTAIRS AT THE BAKERY A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls, posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a few reviews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out the blueprints in front of Jane.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(before she looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been thinking about this addition for ten years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I like this wall of windows, Peter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Adam actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(still perusing, then to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love where you put the stairs. That's so good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam's idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Did she hear that?
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally - I have a real kitchen with four walls... It's...oh, wow...you actually understood what I wanted!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation. Peter looks to Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All Adam.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane turns to Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy you like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally noticing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his hand)
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You read all my e-mails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All 47 of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICE_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, it's 10:15.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICE_MANAGER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rises)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30... dentist. Can you leave these and I'll make a few notes? Well, actually, I have one tiny note now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adam, re: plan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my bathroom...um...no his and her sinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, sure. No his?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't think in the future you might want a his?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, we're talking code about my life, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, didn't mean to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is, in my current bathroom, I have two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One sink. Not a problem. Can we schedule a meeting for next week? Does Tuesday work for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too early? At the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room. The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR ENTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted to start with... and please don't take this the wrong way but I'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DR_MOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOSS>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do? Good, because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky. And in my opinion -- worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DR_MOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOSS>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's good, so, well, as against the whole thing as I am, I do have a problem that's been bugging me. My left eyelid is really saggy. I find I'm sometimes holding it up when I'm watching TV or reading and I was wondering if that's something you could fix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DR_MOSS>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her closely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's resting on your eye lashes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOSS>
<DR_MOSS>
<DIRECTION>
(measures her lids with a very tiny ruler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOSS>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do? Well, I'm only interested in fixing one eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DR_MOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A brow lift? Wh-what is that exactly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DR_MOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We surgically cut at your hair line. Incision goes right across here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(demonstrates on himself
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	by indicating a line
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
drawn like a headband)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jane nods, already hating this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We staple it back in place right above your ears. Recovery isn't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months.

INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button. The elevator moves down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously mid-argument.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up when they realize Jane is in the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<AGNESS>

	Uh, no... changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness' back. It creeps her out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open. Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up his back.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, don't do that..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS and as she answers it --
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- See you in the Big Apple. Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.

	Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up there!

</JANE>

</ADAM>
<JANE>

	About ten years. I bought this place right after my divorce but it's taken me until now to be able to finally do this....

Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.

Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already looking.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's not 100% worked out yet...

<JAKE>

<JANE>

<DIRECTION>
(suddenly insecure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't I show these to you when we get a little closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little. Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I think next we should stake out the addition... see how it all feels - size wise...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds great. ADAM I'll e-mail you and we'll set it up. We did good work today. Jake, nice meeting you.

Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car.

	Why haven't you returned any of my calls or e-mails?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, come on. This is just too weird. We have to just never do what we did - ever again. You're an adulterer and I'm an awful person, basically. I haven't slept in days. What we did was just so wrong on so many levels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it was so right on a couple of levels too. Admit it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>

	No! It wasn't! On no levels was it right!

	You can't say we didn't enjoy each other's company. Sitting at the bar, dancing...after dancing...

<DIRECTION>
(she doesn't want to be reminded)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you and I haven't had fun like that in a hundred years.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Because we're not supposed to have fun like that! We're divorced! Are you like, what? Unhappy at home? Does she not "understand" you? Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age? What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be lying if I said I never think about you, Janey. I think about you. A lot. And no, it's not perfect at home. Obviously. Look at me. I've got three grown kids and I'm going to kindergarten interviews. I'm a walking cliche.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane shrugs. She agrees.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I can't, literally can't stop thinking about what happened in New York. Fate brought us together once, maybe it happened again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pauses...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I know... you've moved on with your life, I get it, but you can't deny something real and honest happened that night. Can't we just go with it, see where it takes us. No one has to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jane shudders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were so great. So loose and sexy. How often do you get to be like that? You can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not high on my list these days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if that someone is someone who's known you since you're 23 and loved you for most of your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot what a good lawyer you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>

	Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is short and it's tough. Don't discount what we have with each other.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what they say... people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the people without plants.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so you're saying you think this is a healthy choice for me?

INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and sober. They catch their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, it's official. We're having an affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you need to label everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that's what this is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, in its crassest form, maybe, if we were two other people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because we were married for 19 years does not not make this an affair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but since we were together for so long, it's not really that wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? You want to run that logic by your wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane fans herself.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor, you're on my side. Can we switch? I feel disoriented.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when is this your side?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since ten years ago. Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands on top of Jane. He pauses.

	Could I interest you in a little...

</JAKE>
<JANE>

	No!

They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed. Jane fans herself. So hot.

	Why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane pulls the sheet up. They look at one another. He gets her to smile.

<JANE>

	I've gotta get to work.

	Me too. Okay...

Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed, checking out his stomach. He notices.

Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her. She indicates Jake should turn around.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I have to..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Because the last time you saw me standing up naked I was in my forties.

<DIRECTION>
(Jake can't believe this)
</DIRECTION>

	Things look different lying down. Just...

Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.

</JAKE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>

	Jake, I think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning back to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I think -- just for the record? I think we're doing something kinda brilliant. All the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. I'd say our problems actually went away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What..? JAKE Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I'm calmer, less obsessed about work. I'm a partner. I'm there. We grew into the people we wanted each other to be! And I don't know... I appreciate things about you I couldn't even see before.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Do you remember never having time for sex? Now look at us. We've already done it two times this week and it's only Tuesday. I swear to God, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. I think we're on to something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not sure I agree and...also, we're not back together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>

	And I know other divorced people think about this...they wonder - what if....

Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head toward THE FRONT DOOR.

</TRISHA>

Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses, then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance. Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.

INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness calling his name in anger. He leaps.

</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That looks amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called a croque-monsieur. It's one of the first things I learned to make when I lived in Paris because the ingredients are really really cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you live in Paris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my early twenties. I went there to take a six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an apprentice in a bakery.

Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.

</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something in the you're too nice department..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that and my wife fell in love with my best friend. Ex-best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were all on a biking trip, he and his wife, me and my wife...through Tuscany and on the last day of the trip they announced they were in love.

</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's awful.

</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Not a great plane ride home.

</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can imagine, sitting there for eleven hours with your wife who you know is -- oh, that's rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually they went on to Venice and I flew back with Carol, his wife. You can't imagine what it's like to sit next to someone who's been crying for ten straight hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't blame her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was talking about me. Anyway, they're married now and it's pretty much an ongoing awful thing. But, you and your ex... When I saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning, I thought -- Wow! That's the way it's supposed to be. You two seem to have it all figured out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not as figured out as you'd think.

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I hope you don't feel I've been interrogating you, but... I know what it's like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department. I mean, do you date ever or...
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, constantly actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Constantly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone I know or have ever known has fixed me up. And then, sometimes I just meet women, I don't know how that happens, but...

</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- But no girlfriend?

<ADAM>

	Not yet.

Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like to date...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I find it really stressful. You know, the last time I was in the dating world was 1978. It's a little more complicated these days. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off. Not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else I know could possibly cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that. She smiles, wiping the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a compliment. So you don't have a guy in your life at the moment?

EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window. He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet, he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.

INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER Jane walks Adam to the door. He holds rolled blueprints.

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort I've ever had... like, in my life.

<JAKE>

	What's with the `big guy'? Is that because you think I'm fat or is it a term of endearment?

</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My marriage is... not turning out as I hoped. That's obvious.... Agness started out really looking up to me... We never used to fight but now... with the kid....lately we're all about where he's gonna go to school and now she says we need a bigger house, more help. I was thinking of cutting back at work... now that's never gonna happen. And she wants another baby before Pedro gets too old which I get but since we're always fighting... oh, God, listen to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't a baby part of the deal when you marry a woman that age?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? I guess so. She's got me booked at the fertility center every other day and she's so amped up on hormone injections I may need to find an exorcist if she doesn't calm down.

	No, I just need to talk...and I was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session. I'm sort of desperate for some advice. I brought you some of that coffee cake you like. Not as a bribe or anything...

<DR_ALLEN>

<DIRECTION>
(reads from Blackberry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? Do I want to get back together? Do we have unfinished business? Is this about revenge? Am I just... lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker" thing? You know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden Jake's back and I get to take care of him in some way...

Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.

	And, listen, I get how therapy works, I do... We look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what....? we're going on eight years, right?.... and I'm okay with that, I like it... but in this case, I need to know what you really think. Like, I'd like you to say... Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. I actually want to be told what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DR_ALLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's interesting is I'm already seeing you open up more than I have in some time. I'm thinking, through this affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_ALLEN>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I need more concrete. Are you saying I should keep seeing him? Because, honestly, if the guilt and fear could go away, maybe I could let go a little and figure this out.

	Yeah, my guess is Flomax is probably the culprit here. It can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so I suggest you stay off it for a few weeks, which apparently your wife will appreciate.

<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - JANE AND JAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with love and appreciation.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Just that move...you have no idea. Not everyone's like that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(mutes Oprah, then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, I have a confession to make. Back when we broke up... I knew it wasn't all your fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean that? You've never said that to me before.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Because when you cheated, I didn't have to. But I think in some way, I gave up on us and I'm not sure you ever really did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring, then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you and Agness... still having sex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake doesn't answer. Jane turns, looks right at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only if she initiates it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane GROANS.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and I figure this out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sees her reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a little trickier at my end than yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Yeah. Okay....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rises...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

(takes Jane's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got really close there for a moment.

INTERCUT JANE AND ADAM
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam! Oh! Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake is instantly jealous. He rises, crosses to the closet, starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very engaged by Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just found out there's a French Film Festival in town and that made me think of you so I was wondering if you'd like to go to the opening night tomorrow night.

	Please.

(hates lying, Jake crosses to her, smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry.

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe we can see something another night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. I would love that. Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
ADAM HANGS UP We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.
</DIRECTION>

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about, putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts...
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

	You'll make the whole thing? The roast chicken, the---
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>

Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face as we begin to HEAR MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JANE'S PATIO - LATE DAY - MUSIC OVER Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in her courtyard. She's singing along with the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PERFECT CAKE - MUSIC OVER sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at her perfect roast chicken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OMIT

<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - MUSIC OVER Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off its hanger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOCK ON A NIGHT STAND tells us it's 8:45.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS' BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping his cell into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<AGNESS>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you taking your cell to the bathroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>

(places it back on the night stand)
</DIRECTION>
<AGNESS>

Jake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed.

<AGNESS>
<DIRECTION>
(while reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</AGNESS>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are?

</JAKE>
<AGNESS>

</AGNESS>
<DIRECTION>
Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEDRO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him. Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding onto his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JANE'S PATIO - NIGHT Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by room, the house becomes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - 6 P.M. The Kids cars are in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking, setting the table, opening wine, chatting.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREN>

Jane and Harley connect. He immediately looks away.

<DIRECTION>
Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harley?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wherever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them. He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs. Jane slices the roast chicken.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That looks incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks up at him, knife poised. Is he kidding?
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg. Jake flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake? Glass of wine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARLEY>
<JAKE>

</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get not calling me back.

</JAKE>
<JANE>

<DIRECTION>
(shuts the door to the living )
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't go out, Jane. She cancelled her plans and every time I tried to call or write, she caught me. I wanted to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, Jake? You were worried about rocking the boat at home? Well now you're rocking my boat and I don't like it.

</JANE>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, don't let one night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand. I'm not even blaming you. I fully participated in this. But I don't want to do it anymore. The last thing in the world I should be right now is your mistress, sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and blowing out candles and wrapping everything in Saran Wrap because your wife cancelled her plans. It was cliche and humiliating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>

(wistfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lit candles?

</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a pretty good life these past 10 years. I figured it out and I moved on. I no longer feel alone or divorced. I just feel normal. You know how long that took, just to get my balance back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is, I'm going in the wrong direction here. But the worst part is... It's feeling like it used to feel. All the little untruths that are hard to catch but add up...

Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...What did you see and what do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Really.

<DIRECTION>
Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.
</DIRECTION>
<HARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(confesses rapidly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, he checked in, you arrived, you met in the elevator, possible kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor came down, thumbs up. That's it. Have no idea what happened in between.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>

INT. HOUSE Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which now has dinner on it. Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the others who are about to sit down for dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
(from the Dining Room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for picking me up, Dad...
	</DIALOGUE>

Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then heads out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He heads toward his car as... JANE
</DIRECTION>

glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - THE NEXT NIGHT Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.

Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her. She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror.

	Adam, this is Agness, Jake's wife...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that is an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life. Seriously. How weird is that? Both of us married to the same man!

</JANE>
<AGNESS>

</AGNESS>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, why go there.

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight face.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there, is...fascinating. I mean, when you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of all the men on the planet, we both said "I do" to this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<AGNESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I know you're having like an "Ah-Ha' moment, but I think I'm gonna get a refill. Adam, good meeting you.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You love me? I mean, I heard "hate" had top billing, but...

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - JANE AND ADAM - TWO STONERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching the sheeter, mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts it into triangles. She's a whiz at this. THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then, Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they work, they make a dozen croissants... NEXT...into the OVEN.

Jane shakes her head. Why did he have to say that? Harley joins the Kids.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problems on the home front? Is one of you seeing someone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

EXT. FRONT PORCH DINING AREA - A LITTLE LATER Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been lifted. His energy is in full bloom.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>

	Jake, you knew the kids were all here. Shouldn't we have talked about this? Agreed this was the right thing to do? This is so typical. Only thinking about works for you.

	I'm sorry, I guess I should've called before showing up.

</JAKE>
<JANE>

	-- And I'm not sure you even left Agness. Maybe she saw something last night and threw you out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the difference? I was drowning over there. I'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out. Janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't, Jake. I told you this the other night. Please listen.

INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly, quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE -- elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He changes his smile to a smoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered.

JANE

dries her hands at the bathroom sink.

Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

	Okay. Let me explain. The reason I left Agness wasn't just because my marriage wasn't working.

	I've also fallen in love...back in love... with your mother. Or maybe I never stopped loving her.

Gabby breaks down in tears. Lauren puts her arm around her. Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's everyone crying? Why isn't this good news?

EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER - THAT NIGHT The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before feeling quite like this.

Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby and Luke. They look like they just woke up.

Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at her children.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible... and sometimes over the years, I've thought that your Dad and I weren't quite finished. And, as it turns out, we weren't. So I went out of my comfort zone, which, I found out, if you're really honest with yourself, isn't all that comforting. So, I experimented with a part of myself. I wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still something there between us.

Lauren smiles with her eyes.

	But Mom, you have to understand how bonkers this sounds to us. For two people who for years couldn't be in the same room together...to then have an affair??? You and Dad...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABBY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know...it was hard for me and I was doing it. I hope you'll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust, but I did this for me and for him and I realized even though your Dad and I once had something extraordinary... we no longer really fit together. But he is a part of me and always will be.

<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's over now? You guys are back to being divorced.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him it wasn't going to work between us but I guess he didn't believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at my house yesterday. He left Agness and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Jane. I actually think I understand what happened but...uh...you know I'm not as macho as I appear and I think it's probably best for us not to get any more... involved because your relationship with Jake isn't really done and I know you're saying it is, but he's in love with you and for everyone's sake, that should probably get resolved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. So that's how grown ups talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Adam smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please tell me you're not going to quit my job and ask Peter to take over because then I'll never get to see you and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking of asking Peter to step back in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I hope you don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane doesn't answer right away.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far back does that sorry go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far back do you need it to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider it an all inclusive apology. From not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, what were you thinking with that move?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you'd find me irresistible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never considered the alternative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta love that about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
They swing some more.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man, can't believe I got up to bat again and blew it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't blow it. We blew it. We blew it the first time around. This time... we just should've known better. Too much has happened. Too much time has passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't think we could make it right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean you didn't feel it was totally right either?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being with you Jane is the best I'm gonna be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But do you agree that it wasn't really...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was complicated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Begging for an answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess that's as close as I'm gonna get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you always have to be so hard on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't regret giving it another shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably would've been better if you hadn't been married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It may never have happened if I wasn't married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side by side, as they sway in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't regret it either.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They continue rocking, not much more to say. As CAMERA PULLS AWAY, we:

EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - MANY MORNINGS LATER It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is stunned he's there.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know it's good luck to start building in the rain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(obviously lying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's a well known, very good, really lucky omen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Thunder rattles the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, I could use one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you all like to have your meeting in the house...it's dry and I've got hot coffee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before someone talks.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, I need to ask you something...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything... ADAM You wouldn't happen to have any of those amazing chocolate croissants, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.... you like those, huh? ADAM I have incredibly fond memories of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have any here, but we could go into town and get some... right out of the oven.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to do that? JANE Yeah... love to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And as they walk away from Camera, we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
