Barbara has donned her leathers once again. She mounts the competition bike. Kick-starts the ENGINE, peeling out into the night.

Dick rolls another racer out of hiding in the shadows. Pulls on his racking helmet. He kicks his ENGINE and starts after her.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. GOTHAM ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groups of motorcycle gangs have gathered. Each is represented by a single racer. Leather clad. Costumed. Dyed hair. Pierced faces. Boys and girls for whom speed is a drug, the streets their home.
</DIRECTION>

Barbara pulls up her bike. A rider (BANKER) looks her up and down.

<DIRECTION>
As Spike and Barbara move in line beside the other racers, another helmeted racer emerges from the shadows to pay his entry fee. His face hidden by his helmet, Barbara can't see that it's Dick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The racers, all helmeted, are in their starting positions. Engines are REVVED. Banker raises a pistol in the air and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bikers SHOOT into the street. Some go over the tops of cars, others across the tops of stoops. Barbara watches as a biker beside her careens into an EXPLODING pile of trash cans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two bikers are going neck and neck towards a racing truck. They split at the last instant, fly up off parked cars, then hit the ground, one SPINNING OUT, the other taking a position at the front of the pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara, Spike, two others hold the lead, leaving the rest in the dust. One of the bikers hits an oil skid, flies into a FIREBALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FINISH LINE is a series of flashing yellow warning beacons atop the incomplete construction of a draw-bridge in the near distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The race is down to three, Barbara, Spike and a third biker, all racing now onto the bridge, riveted steel beneath their wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FINISH LINE is coming up fast, and just beyond the line of flashing cones, an abyss separating the two as yet unconnected sides of the bridge. The trick is to cross the finish line first, but not so fast you can't brake before going over the edge into the water below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spike is trying to keep up. But he's coming up on the finish line too fast for his taste.
</DIRECTION>
<SPIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crazy broad.

</SPIKE>
<DIRECTION>
He hits his BRAKES, slowing, falling out of position. Barbara looks across to see the racer on the other side. Barbara can't see his face, but it's Dick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The finish line is coming up fast. Instead of braking, both GUN their ENGINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FINISH LINE - CLOSE. Barbara flies over the line, Dick a hair behind her, and then both shoot over the edge of the unfinished bridge, into the air, soaring high above the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick's front wheel hits the metal roadway on the other side of the gap, spinning rubber catching steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara's front wheel hits the edge badly, rolling backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick spins over his shoulder, sees what's happening. Barbara's bike is losing purchase, slipping backwards over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick ditches his still moving bike and helmet, rolling off on tucked shoulder, leaping towards the edge as Barbaraâ€™s bike finally slips, she and her hog tumbling downwards into the abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick's jump sends him over the edge, hands extended, feet catching the lip of the bridge, hand grabbing Barbara's ankle, her bike plummeting beneath her as her helmet falls into the water below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick hangs by one foot, holding a dangling Barbara by her ankle.
