EXT. SPACE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
*note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body, this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears warm and inviting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to become darker and more twisted.

Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.

Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.

	They say I don't belong That my place is down below Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme?

<DIRECTION>
Stan is out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his flashlight around.

Kenny's mom and dad come up.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all so wonderful. I just wish our little Kenny could see all of this joy.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle points to the sky. Everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it. As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting towards the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds. (NOTE: This will also be done in 3-D CGI)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings. They smile gently. He feels calm. He feels good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally... into Heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END.
