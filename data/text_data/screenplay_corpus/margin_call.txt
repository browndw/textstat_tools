INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27- year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his early twenties.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that them?

The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as almost every person on the floor watches.

</WILL_EMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS then stops a bit down from them.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>

	Timothy Singh?

<DIRECTION>
TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

	You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work.

INT. TRADING FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors of the elevator open and PETER and SETH look up as WILL EMERSON and SAM ROGERS are standing in front of them about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag. Will looks at it. They share a glancing smile. WILL and SAM step into the elevator keeping the guys in it.

PETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned. The doors open and they exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY BY JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SETH looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn into a small conference room that has no windows. It is claustrophobic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are four people sitting at the table. They stand. Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ALL_PRESENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slight hellos, etc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL_PRESENT>
<DIRECTION>
They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43 year old, although carries himself with intense confidence. He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC. Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SETH COUGHS.

<JARED_COHEN>

	So Sam, what do you have for us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JARED_COHEN>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then.

<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.

</SAM_ROGERS>
<JARED_COHEN>

JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been her call to let ERIC go, she nods yes.

<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's left in your risk department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JARED_COHEN>
<WILL_EMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As of today that would be Peter and our junior analyst Seth...?

Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH. Their inexperience glares back.
</DIRECTION>
<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JARED_COHEN>
<DIRECTION>
JARED looks back at SARAH, then the room goes silent again. Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door.

</WILL_EMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought. Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Eric Dale now?

</JARED_COHEN>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been unreachable since he left the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<DIRECTION>
JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of them and start reviewing. SAM, WILL, PETER, and SETH just sit in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as they all read. This goes on for a full very long minute. Finally:

	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a specialty in propulsion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JARED_COHEN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you are a rocket scientist?

</PETER>
<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you end up here?

</JARED_COHEN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here.

JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.

JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to RAMESH. She looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH_ROBERTSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look we'd need a little more time to go over this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know what he's doing. And I don't have to tell you that this is a problem.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Weeks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JARED_COHEN>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick.

JARED calmly stands up and steps out of the room for a long moment. The room stays completely quiet the whole time he is gone. We hear nothing. It is awkward to say the least. He comes back in and sits down without missing a beat.

They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with people along one side of the table. There are a team of five lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of the table is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence... waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head. He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up.

<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit down.

<JOHN_TULD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome everyone. I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what I've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago... but that is spilt milk under the bridge. So why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks up.

</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<DIRECTION>
PETER is very nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you lost me at M...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was joking Mr. Sullivan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give or take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give or take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what you're saying is it's already happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>

	Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<JOHN_TULD>

	That there are three ways to make a living in this business... Be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even though I like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first.

	You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down.

	I don't think that's ever been a problem.

<JARED_COHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.

They look at each other for a long beat as WILL sizes up the question. In the background the squeals of tires on concrete are heard.

EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders around the almost completely empty city and the further he walks the less his face changes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - STREET CART - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart. He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The wind blows.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other squarely.
</DIRECTION>

He starts to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... You got any inside tips for him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>

This stops PETER dead in his tracks. His world tightens yet clarifies. Finally.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a smile as he says this. They then give a small kiss on the cheek, and part.

INT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass wall separating her office from the floor giving herself total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work. She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real. She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can only openly express even to herself... nothing.

	It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river. Steel through arch design. 12,100 people a day use the thing. It cut out 35 miles each way of extra driving to get from Wheeling to New Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000 miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000 miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a year saved.

At let's say... 50 miles an hour that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020 days... so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 1531 years of their lives not wasted in the car... give or take.

<DIRECTION>
WILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan which spans up and out in front of them through the windshield. There is a long silence, and finally.

<SETH>

<WILL_EMERSON>

	It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better.

	Only if we can get this done, right?

<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ok with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<WILL_EMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, If you want to do this with your life, and do it well, you need to believe that you are necessary. And you are. If people want to live like this...with their big cars and these houses that they haven't even paid for. Then you are necessary. The only reason they can continue to live like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scale in THEIR favor. And if I were to take my finger off... Then the whole world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly. And no one wants that, they say they do...but they don't. They want what we're giving them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea how we get it. And that's more hypocrisy than I can swallow. So fuck em.

</WILL_EMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
Long look out at the city ahead.

He is trying to convince himself as much as SETH. They both look out the windows.

Eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the person go over to the sink and start running water. SETH tries to stop himself from crying. Eventually he accepts that the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and walks over to the sinks. JARED is standing in front of the mirror with his shirt off shaving. His new shirt and tie are on a hanger next to him. SETH walks up to a sink next to him and it is very obvious that he has been crying. He undoes his collar and starts to wash his face.

INT. VIP TRADING ROOM - 6:30 AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly with one another. They are oblivious to what is about to happen. Eventually, SAM, WILL, JARED, and a firm lawyer, come into the room. Everyone quiets down a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL_EMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, hey...(whistles).
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL_EMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of the table. JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corner just to observe. SAM looks somber.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.
	</DIALOGUE>

THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he continues.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes. The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning. There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future. They believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us... as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income MBS today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<DIRECTION>
An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the traders in the room.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers. I have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand. As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus. If the floor as a whole is able to achieve a 93% sale we all get an additional 1.3 million a piece. Because of this, if you burn through your allotment by noon, get moving around the floor and start picking up other guys leftovers...

SAM stops for a second and looks around the room.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. I don't have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important. I want you to hit every bite you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers, and your mother if she's buying...and obviously no swaps, its outgoing only today. This is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down, but the ground is shifting below our feet, and there appears to be no other way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<DIRECTION>
SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees that they indeed know what needs to be done.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_ROGERS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously... this is a very unique situation... if we are successful today we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs... I can not promise that each of you will be repositioned within the firm, but I can tell you that I am very proud of the work we have done together here, I have been at this here for 34 years, and I know... from experience people are going to say some nasty stuff about what we have done here, and what you have devoted a portion of your life to. But have faith that in the greater picture our skills have not been wasted, we have accomplished much, and our talents have served some greater good...

INT. TRADING FLOOR- 8:20 AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a general.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one...

INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs begin to move. We just see the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers. There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<JARED_COHEN>

He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but waves him down. SAM approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_TULD>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<DIRECTION>
They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few more bites of his meal.
</DIRECTION>
<TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what can I do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULD>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a very difficult day, for everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULD>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULD>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<TULD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. I'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. You're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULD>
<DIRECTION>
SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true, and if I had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. I'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_ROGERS>
<DIRECTION>
This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.
</DIRECTION>
<TULD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? That it's all just for naught? Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. They're just the same thing over and over. We can't help ourselves, and you and I can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... We just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TULD>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_ROGERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it John, but not because of your little speech, but because I need the money. I'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but I need the money.

They both look at each other again, then look over and see JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER SULLIVAN next to him.

	Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's all hands on deck now Sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.

He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.
