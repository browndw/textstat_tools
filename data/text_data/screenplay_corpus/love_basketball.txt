</YOUNG_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven. He sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look, Q.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse All-Stars approaching from next door. Walking in the kicks is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap pulled low. A moving van is parked in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought only girls were moving in.

</QUINCY>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>

Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy tosses the Kid the ball. The Kid pulls off the baseball cap. Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown face and bright eyes. She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years old.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah man, he is a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAL>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>

Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>

Monica shoots him a glare.

<JAMAL>

	She heard you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAL>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nuh uh, they could only hear dog whistles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica starts to dribble. Jamal whistles as he walks backwards, guarding her. She throws up a shot. IT'S AN AIRBALL. Quincy and Jamal crack up. Kelvin rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots. Swish.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, zip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls the ball to Monica. She starts dribbling and again, Jamal just backs up with her. She passes to Kelvin. Jamal and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the basket. Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot. It banks off the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET. The boys look at her in shock. Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball. He throws the ball back to Monica.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two, one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica dribbles. Jamal plays her a little tighter. Monica bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two, up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy can't believe it. Kelvin cracks up.
</DIRECTION>
<KELVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaah, she dogged you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELVIN>
<JAMAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAL>
<DIRECTION>
The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets for their teams. Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is unable to stop her. The score hits nine, nine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot. The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the ball. Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy defends. Monica smiles back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told you I was nice. I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'ma be in the NBA. You're gonna be my cheerleader.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket. Quincy stumbles, giving her a step. Kelvin throws it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up. In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving her off balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, FACE-FIRST. SHE GRABS HER CHEEK. BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER FINGERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys stand frozen. Quincy stares down at her, his eyes wide with fear...and regret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes the blood from her face with a washcloth.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eeew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face. She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and painted nails.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling, munchkin?
	</DIALOGUE>

</NATHAN>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is she alright looking the way she does?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Camille, she'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He gives Monica a wink, crosses away. Monica pulls the washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood herself.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get some ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
She exits. Lena shakes her head, follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the mirror. TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK. Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left for this little girl to do. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in block letters across a homemade card. His face is tight with concentration as he tries to write in a straight line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store box to a cake dish. She is 30, beautiful, with effort. She smooths the frosting with a spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer, enters. He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girl, who you trying to fool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy looks up, smiles. He quickly grabs a piece of crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alley-oop, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Nona intercepts his pass.
</DIRECTION>
<NONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NONA>
<DIRECTION>
She points him back to his card. Quincy scowls, starts writing again. Nona scoops some frosting on her finger, holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<NONA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New neighbors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NONA>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting off.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake. Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<DIRECTION>
Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss. Quincy suddenly throws down his pencil in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes. Monica and Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at each other. A large bandage covers Monica's cheek. Monica holds her card, Camille holds the cake.
</DIRECTION>
<NONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NONA>

</CAMILLE>
<NONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the least we could do. And I love to cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NONA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised. She quickly hugs his face into her stomach. Camille lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<NONA>

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy snickers. Nona quickly changes the subject.
</DIRECTION>
<NONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.

Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and Quincy alone. The two just stand there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it in his mouth. Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...does it hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>

</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. A lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.

</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do act different.

	I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>

He shows off a flurry of punches.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks and hand movements. Quincy is impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet you can't do this though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy does a jump kick. Monica does the same.

<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, how bout this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel. It looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake. The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica doubles over, laughing. Quincy is embarrassed. Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monica, what did you do?

</CAMILLE>
<MONICA>

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair. Monica's head flops like a rag doll. Her eyes are wet.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!

<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<CAMILLE>

INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Basketball posters, "Clippers" and USC memorabilia, a basketball globe light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his parents MAKING LOVE. The sounds bring a smile to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear. He moves to his window, sees Monica through her window directly across from his. Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair. Quincy kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house. A basketball is tucked under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater. She is looking cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons. A basketball sits in her back basket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna be my girl?
	</DIALOGUE>

Monica blinks in surprise. She thinks for a moment.

<MONICA>

</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Monica nods. They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips. Quincy counts to five with his fingers. They pull away, embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway.

Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on.

A snarling Black cougar glares down from a large mural. On
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the court below, a girl's basketball play-off game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bleachers are almost half-full with a hyped crowd. In the crowd are Monica's parents. Her father is excited and vocal. Her mom reads a book. Also in the stands, the HEAD COACH OF THE TENNESSEE LADY VOLS, PAT SUMMIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fine-ass BROTHER leans in the doorway, sporting a letter jacket with an embroidered "Q" on the chest. He gets as much attention as the game. A couple of JUNIOR VARSITY CHEERLEADERS smile his way.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEERLEADERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"U", "G", "L", "Y", you ain't got no alibi, you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly. "M", "A", "M", "A", how you think you got that way, your Mama, yeah, yeah, your Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEERLEADERS>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, MONICA, dribbles down court. Just EIGHTEEN, her athletic figure has a few curves, but her loose jersey does little to show it off. Her hair is a mess and her knees are dark with bruises. A small scar is visible on her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting TEAMMATE under the basket, who scores. The crowd cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat. She knocks the ball loose and grabs it up. She goes for a lay-up and the opposing guard steps in front of her. Monica crashes into her, knocking both to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<REFEREE>

</COACH_HISERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot. Monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream. A WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<REFEREE>

Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched. Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed. The brother in the doorway turns, leaves.

Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats on, her face dry. She glances up at the clock. TWENTY SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. Her team's up by SIX.
</DIRECTION>

Her teammates dribble out the clock. The BUZZER SOUNDS and they dance across the floor. Monica looks up in the stands. COACH SUMMIT IS GONE.

Nathan nods. She can always soften her dad, but not her mom.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself. You're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head. I mean, why walk around with your hair looking like "whodunit"...?

As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the curb, slobbing each other down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is a brother who drank his chocolate milk. HE IS ALSO THE BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY.

Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
across the court. He is the complete point guard - hitting from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes, playing tight D.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline. His muscle has softened a little over the last five years of retirement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball. She wears jeans and a T-shirt and her hair is pulled back in a simple pony-tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls down. He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just poster-ized. Behind Monica, TWO GIRLS smack each other excitedly. One of them, SHAWNEE, 17, pretty, big chest, slides down into the empty seat next to her.

Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists. The girl hits the first one. Then, she hits the second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court and throws up a prayer. EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM. AND THEN...IT POPS OUT. An opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice but to foul her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica has just fouled out. She walks to her bench and drops down. She buries her face in a towel and sobs.

ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in closer. Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck. The heat from bodies grows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each other's eyes. They start to look away but find they can't. Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel each other. Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his hands lower down Shawnee's back. The music continues...

<MONICA>

</MONICA>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Jason leans in. Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some more. Monica tries to follow his practiced lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down. His hand moves across her breast. Monica's eyes pop open.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks in the living room window. Her mom is asleep in a chair, trying to wait up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica catches her reflection in the window. She glares at her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back , walks to her bedroom window. She pulls it open, kicks off her heels and climbs through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica moves to her bed and drops down. She sits motionless for a beat, then suddenly feels something beneath her. She reaches for it. IT'S A LETTER FROM THE USC ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT. Monica stares at it in her hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light suddenly cuts through the darkness. Monica turns and is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his room, pulling off his jacket. Monica moves to her window, pulls it open.

</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

Monica takes this in.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was sitting in Jason's ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause I couldn't remember how many offensive boards I had in the championship. And then I guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Beat, then Quincy cracks up. Monica laughs with him.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>

Monica stares at him, surprised. She thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold up for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica disappears back inside. Beat, then she re-appears. She climbs out her window, drops down. Quincy looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out the envelope from USC.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When'd you get this?

</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica nods. Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the grass. Monica sits down beside him. He tears open the envelope and pulls out the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in his face. Quincy finally looks up. Expressionless.

</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica can't contain her excitement. Without thinking, she gives Quincy a kiss. They pull away, then break into nervous laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
But they both want more. They lean in, kiss deeply. They fall back on the grass. And kiss. And kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up. Quincy follows, instantly apologetic. Monica stares at him, then to his surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with her finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie. He nervously unbuttons his shirt. He fumbles with the last two buttons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self- conscious. Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls off his pants. Monica glances down and her eyes widen. She looks scared to death. Quincy smiles softly, leans in and gently kisses her. She relaxes. They lay down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom. His hands shake as he puts it on. They stare at each other as he moves on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy pushes inside her. She flinches back in pain. Quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to stop?

Laughter from the upperclassmen.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH_MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my philosophy is simple. Hard work and sacrifice. There's a lot of basketball history and pride here at USC, but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player. Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player. What you were doesn't matter anymore. For the first time in your life, you won't be the best. You'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined. So the question is, how will you respond? Well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through. Vince Lombardi preached it and I teach it, "There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything."

EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - NIGHT

Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house. He glances around, then walks to the living room. He sees his mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn up. He pulls open the sliding glass door. Nona jumps, then sees Quincy. She quickly puts her drink down.

Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, Quincy opens it. HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:

Zeke outside a party. IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a young woman. IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS. AND YET ANOTHER, they climb into his car.

INT. SPORTS ARENA - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sellout crowd for the men's SC/Temple game. And Quincy is having the worst game of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives down court on a fast break. He ignores his two open teammates and puts up a three-pointer. It hits nothing but air. The crowd boos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Humiliated, Quincy tries to steal the ball back and commits a stupid foul. His teammates glare at him as they line up for free throws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPUS GYM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica's game. Late second half. SC down two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica drives the lane, drawing two defenders. She looks like she's about to force up a shot, then suddenly whips up a pass to a wide-open Sandra at the three-point line. Nothing but net. SC up one.

Coach Miller claps intensely on the sideline.

Ten seconds left. Game on the line. Monica tries to lob a pass inside to Toni. The pass is knocked away and grabbed up by the opposing point guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a one-on-one between Monica and the guard. The girl drives hard for the winning hoop. Monica races to the key and slides in front of her. The guard goes up and slams into Monica. Both crash to the floor as the ball drops through the net and the buzzer goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHISTLE. The two women stare up at the REFEREE from the floor. And then --

	So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<ZEKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel. And another twenty that made it past security on your floor. And the boldest one is standing right at your door. And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.

Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word. Quincy stares back, long and hard.

</QUINCY>
<MONICA>

EXT. STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports bag over her shoulder. She is TWENTY-THREE. Half-assed braids frame her matured features.

<DIRECTION>
She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older arena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors. Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo". (European Championships".)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a large contingent in the crowd. Monica smiles, waves back. TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.

INT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paint peels off the walls. Windows are broken overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles. Her TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish. Monica is clearly an outsider.

Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting and waving signs - the love their women's basketball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her shorts. The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight. Her club's name is stitched on the front, "GODELLA".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her game face. Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, Sidra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
They move into position. The ball is tossed up. Italy winds the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball. Sidra shoves her off and to the floor, and scores. No whistle. Women's pro ball is at a whole other level. Bigger, better, tougher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball is passed in to Monica. She drives down court, goes up for a lay up. An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air, taking out her legs. Monica crashes on the hardwood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whistle. Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word. Without emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music. In the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching the festivities. A large trophy sits on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you take that damn thing off the table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean my championship trophy? My bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm around it. Sidra shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still a cocky bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica laughs. She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>

The waiter nods.

	Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, four years ago. They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people. I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed. So they fire me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.

Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink. She tries to pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDRA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of us don't win championships our first year overseas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else. I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old "Dif'rent Strokes" reruns. Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, "What you talking bout, Willis?" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Sidra laughs. They watch the madness out on the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are these Spanish guys like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just not my type, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>

	Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me.
	</DIALOGUE>

Monica smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever think about going back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<SIDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes. But what's the alternative, not playing? You remember big Toni?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Monica's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here. We just played in the championship game. It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIDRA>

Monica takes this in. Her eyes do not reflect someone on top of the world. She takes a long drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPAIN - MONICA'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, sparse, one-bedroom. Sam, Diane and the rest of the gang from "Cheers" fill the small TV screen that flickers in the darkness. Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE WEARS BOXERS AND QUINCY'S OLD PRACTICE SHIRT. AFTER FIVE YEARS, IT IS WELL-WORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole. She looks out her window and sees her billboard, looming in the distance. She just stares.

Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the rest of the subs. He is twenty-three, a man. His goatee and tired eyes make him look older. HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY- ONE.
</DIRECTION>
<STU_LANTZ>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good to see these guys get a little playing time. And the fans love it.

	Watch out, folks, it's showtime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK_HEARN>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster jam. He swings high off the rim. Too high. His hand slips and he crashes to the floor. His knee twists at a sickening angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee, writhing in pain.
</DIRECTION>

	You're a better ballplayer than I ever was. But you got a lot of other things going for you. You're smart. I always felt...I always knew that you could do anything you wanted. You want to be a ballplayer, be a ballplayer. Just know you ain't like everybody else on that court. You ain't like I was. You got options. That's all I ever tried to show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEKE>

past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing

with flowers. She pulls open the blinds and light floods the room. She crosses back out.

A toilet flush. Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his gown.

</MONICA>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up? To go have sex with him? I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Monica stares at her mother. There's no going back.
</DIRECTION>

	What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?

Monica is busted. It takes her a moment to come back.

Monica stares at her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.

</MONICA>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.

WHAP! Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off Monica with a SLAP. Camille curses herself for losing it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	When I married your father, all I wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so I could start my catering business. And then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I got pregnant with you. And I put it out of my mind because that's what you did.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you want to know what day I remember? In high school, you getting ready for the Spring Dance. I put my pearls around your neck, told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry. That day I was happy I didn't have a catering business to run off to. My family had three meals a day, had someone to pick up after them, and when my daughters went to a dance, I helped them get ready. That's what I came to care about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<MONICA>

	That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.

<CAMILLE>

	You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.

	It mattered, Mom.

Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in her eyes. Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room looks exactly the same. Trophies, medals, plaques. Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of her childhood. THEY ARE EIGHTEEN, PLAYFULLY WRESTLING OVER A BASKETBALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg tucked under the padded bar. A TRAINER stands behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon- time rush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica sits with a BANK MANAGER at the "New Accounts" desk, learning the ropes. Her hair is done, she wears a simple dress. Behind her, hanging on the wall, are three framed photos of the bank presidents. ONE OF THEM IS HER FATHER, NATHAN.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window. She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's stuff. Quincy tries to take his basketball globe light. She laughs, "Hell no."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the contents into her larger bag. Suddenly, she stops. She reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camille smooths it. It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at eighteen, wrestling over a basketball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMILLE STARES AT IT, TAKEN IN BY THE PURE JOY IN HER DAUGHTER'S FACE. She sits down on Monica's bed, still staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court. He is still tentative on his knee, but he keeps jogging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face. His jog turns into a walk, and then he just...stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life. Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls. Trophies and awards. USC memorabilia. His basketball globe light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to his window, looks out at Monica's window. Her room is dark.

Quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the soap from his face. He hears the bathroom door open. He shuts off the water and opens the curtain.

Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee. Quincy slams the curtain closed.

He gives her a smile, and exits. Monica looks at the hoop, then crumples a piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she gets the steal. Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

Monica shoots. The paper drops through the net.

Monica exits her car, after a long day at work. She wears very low heels. But she still stumbles. She curses, then hears a laugh.

<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>

Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T- shirt. He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asked me what was missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From basketball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you woke me up to tell me that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm trying to say is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy doesn't even crack a smile. In fact, he glares.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are you so upset?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better late than never, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy starts back toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll play you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One game. One-on-one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the absurdity.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're out of your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're gonna bitch up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to be, psychology?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica moves past him, reaches through his window. She drops back down, holding his basketball.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prove it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
She throws him the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will this prove?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what happens when you lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy stares at her.

EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica stands opposite Quincy. Both are suited up in
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
basketball gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses him the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy tosses the ball back. Monica drives. Quincy's knee is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up. She scores easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, zip. Check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The game continues. Monica owns the first five points easily by exploiting Quincy's injury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica drives for another lay-up. Quincy suddenly lets go of his fear, leaps and swats her shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the rebound and lays it up. He nods intensely, as he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, five. Check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using his size and strength. He scores seven straight points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The score stays close. It is a sexually-charged battle of wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt. Their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball. Monica yanks off her jersey in frustration. Her ass bumps into his hips as she backs him in. Her hands slide across his chest as she guards him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the score hits nine, nine. Monica slowly walks to the top of the key.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine, up. Point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses Quincy the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense. Monica fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites. Monica drives around him. SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP. SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT ROLLS OFF THE RIM. Monica can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it. He stares at Monica as he dribbles in front of her. She stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks for the basket. Monica stays with him. He goes up. Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot. Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground. He lets go of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also. GAME OVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Quincy stares at her. Monica looks back. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All's fair in love and basketball, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up. She slowly walks back toward her house. And then:
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica slowly stops, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double or nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right. Quincy limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monica slowly walks back to him. They stare at each other. No more egos, no more bullshit. Just love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:

INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music is blasting, banners are waving, crowd is screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magic Johnson sits in a floor seat, watching the game. A
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REPORTER interviews him.
</DIRECTION>
<SPORTS_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Magic, are you contemplating another comeback?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPORTS_REPORTER>
<MAGIC>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more comebacks. Tonight I'm just enjoying being a spectator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGIC>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks out at the court. It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New York Liberty. The WNBA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, McCall!
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and the number thirty-two, looks over. Quincy takes their daughter's hand and waves it.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go Mommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCY>
<DIRECTION>
Monica smiles back, then steps to the line. The referee tosses her the ball. Monica stares at the basket, then bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THAT'S GAME" END CREDITS
