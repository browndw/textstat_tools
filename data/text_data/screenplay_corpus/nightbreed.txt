:SC: NIGHTBREED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scene 1. TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. Then, a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand. The light shows us a mural. We start to move along the wall. First we see stars and planets, painted in a primitive, stylized fashion on bare rock. A voice on the track speaks softly to us.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did not always live in hiding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We have come to the image of a huge family tree, which springs from a single seed but divides into two separate halves. On the left, ruled by the moon, the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures. On the right, by sunlight, the branches end in ordinary human beings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen, against the image of a moon painted on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REEDS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to a real moon. Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape, through which the camera careens madly. The soundtrack, which was lush and almost sacred in the mural chamber, erupts into a tribal rhythm. We glimpse creatures in the darkness, moving through the reeds. They are barely more than silhouettes. We see teeth, and gleaming eyes; glimpses of naked, patterned flesh. Only glimpses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MURAL CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut back to the mural chamber. Now we have moved away from the tree to a more brutal scene. A symbolic representation of a great apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed. Terrible scenes of destruction.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the Naturals made war on us. They feared us for our strength. They envied our powers. They called us monsters, killing us by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each of us our particular vulnerability.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We are scanning scenes of that war. A breed being staked like a vampire. Another being shot like a werewolf. Another exposed to sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of us was safe. The tribes of the moon dwindled. Our gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed. It was the Apocalypse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut back to the landscape. The clouds roil above the heads of the creatures heading through the reeds. We see their destination now. A huge wall, with gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MURAL CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And back to the mural chamber, and a final scene. The gates we've just seen are in the painting. Looking over them, calling the Breed in, is a vast indistinct form: that of Baphomet. His eyes burn; his arms are open in welcome.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust. Baphomet. Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last, into hiding. Into Midian, where we wait now. The battle is over but not the war. There will come a saviour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Now we've moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches. We can interpret some of the images nevertheless: a man with a bloody hole in the middle of his chest. A man wearing a mask like a skull. We linger on a faceless figure.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is Cabal. He will lead and give us back the Night. We are the tribes of the moon. We are the Nightbreed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The titles end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut back to the landscape. Now we are at the gates, and the creatures slip through and away into the mist. Only one, a beautiful, ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains, turning to look at us. She beckons.
</DIRECTION>
<SHUNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUNA>
<DIRECTION>
The camera retreats from her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHUNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you not come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHUNA>
<DIRECTION>
Now the last of the creatures, the Drummer, takes her by the arm, snatching her away through the gates. As she disappears, the camera follows again, stopping at the gates themselves, which close with an unearthly din.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. LORI'S APARTMENT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. on Boone, closed eyes. He is dreaming. His gaze roves beneath his lids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori's lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling down his face to his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boone...wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<DIRECTION>
Boone's eyes flicker open.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. You OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<DIRECTION>
Boone: Yep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Boone's eyes are fully open. He sits up. Looks towards the open window. Night beyond. She kisses him, distracting him from the sight of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something to eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine-thirty. I was letting you doze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you'd worn me out, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DIRECTION>
Lori smiles, and kisses him, then crosses the room to the kitchen area, picks up some fruit, and a knife, carrying both back to where Boone is lying on the bed. It is unmade. Both Lori and Boone are lightly dressed, clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon lovemaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori: You know what?
</DIRECTION>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should get out of Calgary for a few days. Just take off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anywhere special?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere we can be alone together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More alone than this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Just you and me. No work. No telephone calls. No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No bad dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I always know. It's no big deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going around in some crazy loop in my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say it like you mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe it. I'm not crazy. But I want this damn dream out of my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and goes to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Decker's started calling me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All last week. Every day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does he want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I haven't called him back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he can help, see him. Tell him it's all gone but the bad dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not bad. That's what's weird. The more I have them the more I like them. Now I do sound like a crazy, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You sound like the man I love. A little haunted, maybe, but the sanest man I ever met.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you see Decker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I should?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the harm? You tell him from me, I'm the only thing you should be dreaming about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think he'd get it. He never had a wet dream in his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to be competing with things I can't see, Boone. Can't share I don't want to be always feeling that something's pulling at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going anywhere, Lori. Except with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't hear that often enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never leave you. Not ever. I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her, passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't remember a time when I didn't love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about before we met?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again. We move past them into the darkness outside the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dissolve to the moon, clearing cloud.

A pleasant house in a pleasant neighborhood. Lights burn inside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa Rickman emerges from the lounge, with a Dagwood sandwich, a work in progress. She is thirty-five, and going to seed in a gentle way. Her husband, Lou Rickman, a similar type, is planted in front of the television.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you want ham, cheese, pickle, mustard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of the above and a brewski, thank you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm comfortable. I like myself fat. I like you fat too...

(secretly amused - she hushes him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it down, Lou, you'll wake the munchkins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
She hears something upstairs, goes to the foot of the stairs, looks up. Her eldest son, Lou Two, waddles into view. He's five.
</DIRECTION>
<LOU_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU_TWO>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetie, you're supposed to be beddy-bye.

	I heard something.

</LOU_TWO>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<LOU_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU_TWO>
<MELISSA>

	No, everything's okay. You go back to bed, munchkin, I'll be up to see you in a minute.

<DIRECTION>
Melissa disappears from the bottom of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa enters, moves out of sight. We stay at the door. A figure appears dressed in black, knives in both hands, and crosses to leave the screen again. We do not see his face. But we hear his labours: the sound of the blades slicing Melissa. She staggers into view, grabbing hold of her slit throat. Blood bubbles between her fingers. The figure appears behind her. She turns, as the knife descends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICKMAN LOUNGE NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Lou hears a sound, rises and moves towards the kitchen door.
</DIRECTION>
<LOU>

</LOU>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the stairs, Lou Two watches wide-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICKMAN STAIRS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lou Two's P.O.V. - We see blood running along the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICKMAN KITCHEN NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lou reaches the kitchen door and sees Melissa laid out, dead, on the kitchen table
</DIRECTION>
<LOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God - GOD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOU>
<DIRECTION>
Lou enters, the figure emerges from behind him. While we remain at the door watching, detached, Lou fights back, throwing himself back and forth around the kitchen. But the figure is much stronger. We glimpse its face now, it is a mask, with a zipper for a mouth and buttons for eyes, blank. Devoid of compassion, hatred or regret. A death's head, made by a mad child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop the stairs, Lou Two listens. His baby sister cries in her cot. He looks her way then back downstairs. The sounds cease. Silence. Terror on his face. Then the child's perfect nightmare appears at the bottom of the stairs. The figure, heavy knife in hand, starts to climb, dragging Lou's bloody body after him by the hair.

EXT. RICKMAN HOUSE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three patrol cars, an ambulance, policeman restraining a small crowd gathered outside. A n.d. sedan roars up, red bubble light flashing, and Inspector Joyce gets out and moves towards the house. He's greeted by the Medical Examiner, Dr Burton, just exiting, carrying a medical bag.
</DIRECTION>
<BURTON>

	If it's any comfort, they went quickly.

</BURTON>
<JOYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Makes me feel a whole lot better about the sick fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOYCE>
<BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find this guy, Joyce. They say these guys want to be caught. I think this one likes it too much.

A rookie patrolman stands on the doorstep, on the verge of tears.

The sun climbs above the horizon, behind the cityscape of Calgary. Another day begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DR DECKER'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two years. They're on Decker's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been listening to the tapes of our sessions. All two years' worth...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and moves around to the other side. Boone is sitting on the other side of the desk, his posture far from relaxed. He hates this room. As Decker moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls. Dance pictures, photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc.
</DIRECTION>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But you...you intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember Midian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't me. I heard about Midian from other people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you made it part of your private mythology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I did. It was a place of refuge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Boone's looking uneasy now. He wipes sweat from his upper lip.
</DIRECTION>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I used to dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see. Great detail. Almost as though the violence was real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters don't exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But murder does, Boone. Murder's very real. It may start in the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the photographs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two days ago the police brought me some photographs. They wanted to know if I had any patients who might be capable of what's in these photographs. I'm going to show you them. Are you ready for that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Boone nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker lays the photographs on the table. Boone picks them up. We get glimpses of what they contain. Domestic horrors. Bloody scenes of corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and bleeding. Boone's breath quickens.
</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you talk about murder on the tapes, I thought it was invention. Now I'm not so sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Boone keeps staring at the pictures. The glassy eyes stare hard at him. His breathing is now rapid and shallow. One or two of the images seem to move. Bodies twitch. He drops the photographs.
</DIRECTION>

	I didn't...

</DIRECTION>
<DECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. Take these, they'll help. Go home, and consider what we've talked about. I'm going to give you twenty-four hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own accord. That's as long as I can give you. if you haven't complied by then, I'm afraid I'll have to tell them what I know.

Boone exits into the hall, forces open the vial of pills, swallows a couple, shaking, trying to control his terror.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DECKER'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker sits at his desk, lifts his briefcase, opens it, tosses the folder of photographs into the case. Looking into the case he seems on the verge of some powerful emotion. Rage? Revulsion? He snaps shut the briefcase. The emotion passes.

<DIRECTION>
Boone opens his drawers and pulls out photographs, his passport etc and starts to make a pile with them. He pours lighter fuel on the pictures, and watches them burn. Sitting against the wall still sweating he takes some more pills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Lori's love letters burn and hear her voice speaking the words as they are consumed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boone cries. Then he hears Lori's voice say:
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boone...

Lori is sitting on the edge of the bed. Boone looks round, sees himself against the wall and moves forward past the real Boone towards the bed...

Lori's P.O.V. looking though the crowd in front of the stage. Lori spots Boone standing near the entrance, his face in shadow.

Her eyes light up with joy as the song builds to climax. It ends. Applause, cat whistles, foot stomping. Lori's in heaven. She looks out again.

Boone is gone.

Boone edges out closer to the road. Spots a huge semi with a fully loaded trailer barrelling down towards him.

Lori opens the note and reads: 'Keep this. Burn the rest. All wrong.' Tears burst from Lori's eyes.

A blaze of light. A bustling emergency receiving area. A stern nurse goes through the pockets of Boone's jackets, which is lying beside him on a gurney. His eyes are closed, face and T-shirt bloody. She fishes out the vial of pills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boone moans, opens his eyes.

The doctor takes the vial of pills, checks the label. Opens Boone's eyes, shines a penlight flash on the pupils. Boone recoils. Doctor takes his pulse.

In an emergency room cubicle, a patient is having a seizure. The nurse rushes off, leaving Boone. Interns roll the cardiac cart towards the cubicle and curtains close around the scene.

Boone opens his eyes. Looks across the room at Narcisse, a wild man, half-derelict, half-punk, bloodied, his hand bandaged, pacing back and forth like a caged cat, staring out of a large picture window at the night.

Narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets, then comes out with long, silver, razor-sharp artificial nails, curved like hooks, attached to his thumbs. He holds them right at Boone's throat, ready to cut. He smiles.

Boone shakes his head. Narcisse draws one razor-nail lightly across his own throat. A thin trickle of blood runs down his neck. He chuckles.

As the door swings open, Boone looks out into the corridor and at the far end of the emergency room he sees Decker and the cops looking his way. Medical support move towards the room, as the nurse and intern try to contain the ranting Narcisse.

Boone grabs a loose doctor's coat off the back of the door, slips it on and backs out of the room.

The Necropolis is vast. High walls, surrounded by reeds, with the tops of mausoleums, showing above it. ALmost a fortressed town.

Boone starts towards it.

EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY

The sun is low in the sky, the light golden glinting off the gates. The reeds sigh. Boone pushes one of the gates open and steps inside. His footsteps echo, unnaturally loud in this city of the dead. To either side of him, elegant and elaborate mausoleums, running away into the distance, with numerous smalls tombs set around and between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun finally sinks out of sight. Its final glow dies on the tops of the mausoleums. There are already stars overhead.

Boone walks on a little way, as the night sounds begin. Exhausted, he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone.

He rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket. Pulls one out. Lights it. The flame seems to excite sounds around him. He looks up. The walkways are empty in both directions.

There's a guttural sound at his back. He stands, drops the cigarette, backs away. From the darkness behind him steps a huge form. A knife is put to his lower belly. Its wielder, Kinski, is a massive man, face distorted, his features grotesquely bifurcated.

Peloquin growls, throwing his head back and forth with a strange grace, the image flickering as he does so. Boone watches, amazed. In the blur of Peloquin's motion he transforms, the tentacles on his head lengthening and thickening, thrashing around as though they have a life of their own.

A sound above him. He looks up. Peloquin is climbing down the mausoleum wall, mouth opened wide to take off Boone's head. Boone throws himself forward as the jaws snap shut, missing him by inches. He runs. Kinski appears in his path. For an instant Boone thinks the game's up...

EXT. MIDIAN DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl - wandering from the car into the reeds. She lights a cigarette, tunelessly humming to ward off the willies. She stops, shivers, suddenly feeling very isolated. The atmosphere's got to her. She starts back to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She catches some movement out of the corner of her eye. Stops. Slowly walks away from the movement, fighting off panic. She turns a corner, and realizes she's lost in the reeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears movement behind her, turns, startled, then, oddly, she smiles.

EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori reaches the gates, slightly breathless. She pushes one of them open. The sun is hot and bright, transforming the Necropolis from the dark, dangerous place it was when Boone was here. Now, with its gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life, it's almost welcoming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori wanders the walkways, enchanted by the splendor of the place. There are strange, bittersweet sights along the way: statues of dogs sleeping on their masters' graves; of mourning mothers; of children, sitting at their graves. And grotesque images too: gargoyles protecting the doorways of mausoleums; a tiger, roaring in stone. It is another world, solemn and silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except...suddenly, the sound of an animal in pain. Lori stops and looks around. Her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree beneath which the shadows are pitch black. From here, the sobbing comes. She approaches. There is an animal beneath the tree, barely discernible. She can see its flanks panting, its head moving in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't look like a recognizable species, an amalgam of wild cat and deer. She approaches. It raises its head, weakly. Its eyes are huge and black.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God...you poor thing...don't die, please don't die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes beneath the tree, puts her arms beneath the creature and picks it up. It is heavy, a dead weight in her arms. She backs out from beneath the tree. As she steps back into the sun, the creature snarls and starts to wither in her arms. She realizes what's causing it pain and steps back into shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like the sun? Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORI>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of sobbing, off to her left, draws her attention. One of the mausoleum doors is open, and a woman, Rachel, dressed in black, stands in the shadows, weeping. Lori's astonished.

Shading the creature from the sun, Lori moves to the door and steps into the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAUSOLEUM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior is marble, the air murky. Rachel, a fine-boned, pre- Raphaelite beauty in her thirties, moves back against the far wall, nursing a wounded arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori looks down at the creature she's carrying, utterly limp in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm afraid it's too late.

</LORI>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Rachel reaches out. Lori's reluctant to move further into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
As Lori crosses the floor, she hears whispering from a stairway that leads down into the earth. She stops, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pay no attention. Please, bring me my Babette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
As the creature is named it starts to move in Lori's arms. Not only move, but change. Its claws grab at Lori's breast as it writhes.

But Lori can't help but look. Appalled, she tries to pull the transforming creature off her, but its hold is firm.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Jesus!

With effort, she detaches the creature's claws from her, almost throwing it at Rachel, who cradles the changing creature in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Babette...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>

Lori leans against the wall, trying to wipe the sticky fluids the creature's exuded onto her hands. When she looks up she sees the creature in Rachel's arms has transformed into a pale, beautiful girl of seven or eight. Lori's dumbstruck.

Impressed by her resolve, Lylesburg stands aside. She moves past him and heads down into the chamber, towards a distant light. Lylesburg gestures after her. Ohnaka nods and follows.

INT. BERSERKERS' CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori starts down the corridor, the walls of which are cracked wide in places, the gaps covered with chains. From the other side she hears grunts and growls. Then, to her shock, one of the Berserkers' arms reaches up from a grille in the floor and snatches at her leg. She steps aside to avoid it, and another of the Berserkers' arms reaches through the mesh of chains, taking hold of her by the neck. It starts to choke her. She shouts for help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ohnaka, Lylesburg's fool, appears from down the corridor. He starts to rattle the chains further along the wall.

	Hey, Ghost! Hey, Slaughter! Come and get me! Come and get me!

INT. OUTSIDE BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ohnaka and Lori reach the next to last chamber; a roaring from below, down a slope in front of them, walls vibrating with the din from Baphomet's chamber. Ohnaka withdraws. Blindingly bright light, out of which Lori spots a figure climbing towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boone? Boone!

</LORI>

She moves down to Boone, scrambling up the slope towards her, drenched in sweat, half-mad with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<BOONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't...don't look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOONE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for her, then collapses. She starts down the slope to him. Dust falls from the roof, the din makes her reel. But she reaches him, starts to haul him to his feet. Then, she looks up and we get a glimpse of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAPHOMET'S CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the blinding light, and seemingly the source of it, a huge, black figure turns towards her, twelve feet high, severed limbs connected by sinews of hot, white energy and extruded spines, the face terrible, wise and beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lori's stunned, she averts her eyes. Boone collects himself enough to pull her away and they help each other frantically scrabble up the slope, out of the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

As Lori and Boone emerge, Ohnaka appears and beckons them to follow. Too exhausted and frightened to speak, Boone and Lori follow.

INT. MIDIAN CENTRAL CORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ominous rumblings urge them on, as Boone and Lori make a stumbling ascent through the core, trailing Ohnaka's urgent lead, watched from the doorways by a variety of creatures. We cut to the ledge, and move to a chamber, where Peloquin and Shuna Sassi are making love. Peloquin hears Lori urging Boone on as they struggle across the bridge, and looks away from Shuna, out through the door.

Boone pushes the door open. Inside, a massacre: five dead card players, propped up around a poker table in a sick parody of a poker game tableau; throats slit, Buffalo Hats on their heads. Sitting in the middle of the table, a tall, elaborate house of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boone moves into the middle of the room. On his face we can see the hunger he feels. Ripples of color begin to move over his features. He moves towards the corpses...as he does so, we hear a nearly deafening sound from outside...the vibrations knock over the house of cards and...

Boone enters the bathroom with the sound of the Swat Team's entry to the motel on the track. He slams the door. There is blood on his face and hands. He goes to the sink and turns on the tap. Then he sees himself in the mirror, his transformed face is a shock, He looks at himself, appalled. Then a wave of nausea overtakes him. He throws up into the sink; a splash of blood and flesh he's just eaten. Wiping his mouth with the back of his hands he starts to breathe out his condition. His face transforms back to his normal state. He makes a sob of horror.

As the sound of Boone being beaten up filters through the wall, Ashberry sits in his cell, Bible in hand. He flicks the pages over, attempting to distance himself from the violence he hears with study. He halts at a page with an illustration. It is something from Revelations: monsters and demons doing battle with angels. He puts the book down, and turns over his palm. It is a mass of tiny scars. He closes his hand into a white-knuckled fist, retreating into the shadows in the corner of his cell.

The smoke from the key-hole begins to form into a face, which floats on a cord of smoke/flesh from the key-hole. The smoke from beneath the door forms into breasts and rib cage, in which a heart beats. Labowitz turns and sees it.

An arm moves towards Labowitz; so does Rachel's face. Her beauty mesmerizes him. Her naked breasts, which float beneath the head, barely connected to it as yet, enchant him even more.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>

	Come closer...I don't want to kill you...

Her hand presses Labowitz's rifle aside. Rachel's lips touch him. He doesn't resist, but once his mouth is sealed against hers he can't breathe. He tries to raise the rifle, but she dashes it from his hand. Then she snatches the keys from his belt and breaks the kiss. He falls to his knees, gasping. Her body completed and naked, Rachel unlocks the connecting door, then starts looking for Boone. Behind her, as Labowitz reaches for his gun, Narcisse's hand reaches in and grabs his throat.

Ashberry comes round a tomb and we follow him down a walkway, staring in awe at the mausoleums and statuary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at a particularly large tomb, Ashberry's eye is captivated by a large, fantastically rendered marble winged angel. He approaches it, reaches up to touch it. The angel, a monster, turns to look at him with sad, impassive gravity. Then we see its shadow on Ashberry's face and hear the slow, thick beating of its wings as it flies off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ashberry's stunned. He fumbles the top of his bourbon canteen off, takes a long drink, then stops when he sees a load of dynamite taped to the side of the tomb. He follows the wire that leads off it to another dynamite pack on an adjacent tomb and then another. He's panicked.

Ashberry looks up, as he hears grindings and growls in the earth. Boone is lifting off the top of a nearby tomb. Ashberry is about to shoot when Narcisse grabs him around the throat, puts a finger to his lips and signals him to be quiet. Narcisse follows Boone into the tomb.

Kane pushes the mausoleum grille open, as the 1st cop kneels over, face down. The 2nd cop kneels to help him. Meanwhile, Kane has stepped into the mausoleum. Shuna is in the corner, her spines covered with the swaths of red cloth.

<DIRECTION>
In panic, he fires at Kane, who falls to the ground. As the smoke clears a hand appears and strokes his cheek. He turns. It's Shuna. He screams, and falls to the ground at her feet, his arm covered in spines. He twitches, and dies. She drops her swath of red cloth over the faces of the three dead men.

Boone races through the walkways, Ashberry following. There is pitched hand-to-hand battle on every side. Nightbreed are prevailing in some; in others the mob repeats scenes from the history we witnessed earlier: Breed being beaten or burned to death, impaled on stakes. Boone assists some along the way, pulling off their assailants.

Lylesburg has reached the door of the Berserkers' chamber. He puts the key in the lock. A shout stops him turning it. He looks towards a man with a laser-sight rifle.

The light from the rifle plays on Lylesburg's robes.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
It moves up towards Lylesburg's face, until it's centred on his forehead. The man fires, killing his victim. Lylesburg falls, hanging from the door by the key chain around his neck. His many eyes have opened. The man grins. Then hears a noise behind him. He turns to see the Ferreol Vees, creatures like Manta Rays that glide through the air, appearing around the corner. They swoop towards him, separating. The middle one opens its mouth as it strikes his face. He is eclipsed. When the Vees pass on down the corridor, the man's face is a bloody wreck. He falls to the floor, just out of reach of the Berserkers, who roar their frustration.
</DIRECTION>

Boone and Ashberry are on one of the walkways, which are swinging violently. Boone hears the Berserkers' roar, and heads towards the door that leads into their corridor, leaving Ashberry on the bridge, tears pouring down his face. Then he follows Boone. As he reaches the ledge he looks back to see a fabulous beast, the Mezzick-Muul, and its beautiful rider, Diadaria, appear. He watches, awestruck.

INT. BERSERKERS' CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boone reaches the door. Lylesburg is dead. Boone pulls the key from off Lylesburg's neck, and pulls the corpse aside. Then he turns the key in the lock. The door opens. A rush of filthy wind emerges from the chamber beyond. Then the Berserkers appear: lethal brutes, all teeth, armour and muscle. One of them, Ghost, takes hold of Boone, and there's a beat when it seems certain to dispatch him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a burst of light from Baphomet's chamber spills over them, and there's a roar from their unseen God. They let Boone go, and they're away. Boone looks towards the chamber, then heads back towards the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number of wounded Breed against one of the walls. One of the creatures attempts to scramble away. Tommy guns him down. He turns to the other gunmen.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
The two posse members prepare to kill the Breed. The ground around them begins to shudder, and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs the leg of a posse member and drags him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another fist then bursts out of the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then in silhouette the Berserkers climb out of the earth beside the posse. Two of the posse turn, and fire at the Berserkers, who advance through the hail of the bullets, and quickly dispatch the two gunmen. Tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered Breed, obliging them to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dance, fuckers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
The display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three surviving posse members, who - like Tommy - are as yet unaware that the Berserkers are advancing on them. Tommy continues to fire at the ground around the Breed, as one by one his three companions are dispatched by the Berserkers. We close in on Tommy, whose face is suddenly spattered with blood. He stops firing. He looks round to find himself surrounded by Berserkers. The shadows fall over him. Their hands take hold of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls: his body is torn apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to the Berserkers. Ghost has Tommy's gun, with the hand still attached. He tosses it aside, roaring like King Kong. The wounded Breed hurry away as the Berserkers head off in search of new mischief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NECROPOLIS NEAR THE GATES NIGHT

With the tide turning inside the Necropolis, a disorganized retreat is underway. Eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his 'army' staggering away. Joyce is watching the scene.

	Stand your ground! Stand your ground! They've got to come this way. We can mow 'em down.

He climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates. In the driving seat is Gibbs. Beside him, a woman, her face smoke-stained, her expression near catatonic.

Gibbs switches the lights on, to pierce the smoke. Bad move. The illumination shows the Berserkers appearing. They approach the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<EIGERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EIGERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eigerman jumps from the vehicle, as the retreating posse fire at the Berserkers. It's a useless response. Bloodied but unbowed, the Berserkers run at the vehicles. The woman throws herself out, but Gibbs isn't quick enough. One of the Berserkers pushes the vehicle up the wall of the Necropolis, and Blatz, a small, vicious creature, stamps on the roof. Inside, Gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in. He is crushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce, who has been watching this entire scene, moves away from the gate towards the Necropolis. The fires are dying down somewhat, and an eerie half-light bathes the scene he moves through. A few surviving posse hurry away, firing at every movement in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back at the gate we see one of the escaping Berserkers flip another car over, while his brothers dispatch posse members. The survivors simply drop their weapons and flee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAUSOLEUM NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The dog-faced man lies dead at the door and beside him Babette, her face subtly bestial. Joyce hears Babette weeping; her cries hit him hard. He goes to her, gathers her up gently in his arms. Babette clings to him; he sees her arms are partially transformed into claws, but he keeps holding her.

There are only one or two Breed left alive down here, desperately collecting their belongings. They exit the chamber leaving the smoking bowls...We track towards the bowls, as the contents brighten and bubble.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DECKER>
<DIRECTION>
Boone falls back. Decker closes on him, the knives at his neck. The force of his stabs, which miss Boone's neck, break the boards of the bridge. Boone braces his feet beneath Decker and tosses him over. Decker gets up and approaches him again, slashing the ropes of the bridge with his blades as he comes. The fighters connect and struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the bridge, dropping them down another level. Decker lands very heavily, and lies still. Boone gets up. His exit along the bridge in one direction is blocked. He has to step past Decker who doesn't move. Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up, pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the knives at his victim's back. The blade cuts straight through Boone, sticking out from his chest a good six inches. He turns, his fury transforming him into a more extreme creature. Decker comes at Boone with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck. The battle carries them off the bridge onto the stairs. Decker takes hold of Boone's hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace. Boone reaches for a weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask. Decker lets go. Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decker follows down the stairs. Boone pulls the table off his chest, leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest. Decker follows through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the fight continues. Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with. Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and driving him out on to the ledge once more. Decker teeters on the edge, now defenceless. Boone approaches.

He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling Decker on his own blade. Decker screams.

Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge. Decker falls.

Boone stands on the ledge, and spits down at the corpse. As he does so he hears the same roar from Baphomet that called the Berserkers from harming him. Out of it, comes Baphomet's face.

Blinding light. As Boone descends into the chamber, he sees eight Nightbreed, surviving members of a Senior Council, Rachel among them, standing around Baphomet. They are wrapping severed limbs of Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus. His head and shoulders remain suspended in the light. Baphomet's lips move, making a terrible, eloquent sound.

EXT. NECROPOLIS

Lori and Boone stand in the reeds as the last, bright bloom of the fires dies away on their faces. Figures move away through the smoke, creatures we recognize. The drummer beats out a tattoo as they depart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Narcisse appears from the darkness. As he does so, a final explosion roars up from the underground. In the smoke pillar above the site, Baphomet's image momentarily appears before the wind disperses it.

EXT. NEAR MIDIAN NIGHT

In the distance, the burning ruins of Midian. The wind sighs in the moonlit reeds. Cabal and Lori reach the top of the hill, turn and look down, standing apart.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well go on, then, just go. Go on! What more do you want? Leave me some dignity, for Christ's sake!

</LORI>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. She turns away, trying not to show him her pain. Cabal turns to go. Lori turns back, sees him going. She can't bear it, looks around, sees Decker's briefcase lying beside the police car. Runs to it, finds a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<LORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boone!

He turns. She puts the blade to her belly and drives it in.

	Lori, NO!

She cries out and sinks to the ground in terrible pain. He reaches her and holds her in his arms.

He raises her neck to his mouth. Her eyes flicker closed. He bites. A fatal, bloody kiss. He rises from her. Her eyes are closed.

<CABAL>

Her eyes open. She's turned.

EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We track through the ruins of the Necropolis. The walls are blackened by fires that are almost extinguished; corpses (human and Breed) lie in barely distinguishable bundles, from which partially cremated limbs jut. Smoke hangs in the air. From the distance we see Eigerman, going amongst the corpses, reclaiming guns, bullets and grenades. As we get closer we realize that he is a broken man, his face dirty, his eyes lunatic. He's been crying, the tracks marking the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he hears a noise, and stands up to see a large figure appearing from the smoke. He goes for his own gun, levelling it at the figure as it approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<EIGERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your distance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EIGERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The figure keeps coming, emerging from the smoke. It's Ashberry. He has been transformed by the confrontation with Baphomet. His hair has been almost burned away entirely and there is a subtle reconfiguration in the shape of his skull. His clothes are in tatters. There are hints that his once broken body, poisoned by alcohol, has taken on new strength. He looks as insane as Eigerman, but stronger in his lunacy. There's a dangerous fervour in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ASHBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw their God...I saw him...

<EIGERMAN>

<ASHBERRY>

	I can still smell him. He's out there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHBERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Ashberry walks past Eigerman towards the exit from Necropolis.
</DIRECTION>
<EIGERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you can find them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EIGERMAN>
<ASHBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHBERRY>
<EIGERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go together then. You can lead me to the bastards. Then I'll wipe them all away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EIGERMAN>
<ASHBERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. They're mine. Their God burned me. I want to burn him back. All of them. Burn them all away.

</ASHBERRY>
<EIGERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't, you don't have the wits ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EIGERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ashberry turns on him, his face wild. He takes hold of Eigerman by the neck, his fingers digging into the muscle. Blood runs. Eigerman tries to raise the gun but Ashberry takes hold of the man's hand, and summarily snaps his wrist. The gun is dropped. Ashberry starts to lift Eigerman up off the ground. The policeman's flailings stop suddenly. The head lolls. Ashberry flings the body aside, and starts out of the Necropolis. As he approaches the exit he looks up. Sunlight falls on his face.

Moving through the ruined chambers, illuminated by dying flickers of flame, we find and track along the end of the heroic mosaic/mural. It tells, in a rush of images, the story of the ruin of Midian.

Camera comes to a stop on the final image: Cabal and Lori, as we just saw them, on a hill, framed against the star-filled heavens.

The sound of the wind...

Fade to black.
