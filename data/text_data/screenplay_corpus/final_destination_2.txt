TITLES OVER:

<DIRECTION>
A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to the early 1900s:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC" appears over "FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP." Another series of articles reads, "JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG" and "PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE." Etc...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex Browning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of another and the face- down body of Alex Browning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc...

LATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its corners and place it in the center of all the others:

EXT. KIMBERLY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIMBERLY BURROUGHS, 19, puts a folded AAA map in her mouth. She opens the back of a RED NISSAN SUV, and pla ces her duffel bag inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her free hand and turns to hug her father, MR. BURROUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.

</SHAINA>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly and Mr. Burroughs turn to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHAINA, 19, tall leggy brunette. Tan, tight tube top revealing her pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend. She walks up the driveway with her bags.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that makes me feel a lot better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV. Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, honey. I just --

Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, the guys are waiting!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buckle up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON OLD WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is shrill and disturbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP AHEAD

Waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly accidentally KISSES the bumper in front of her while daydreaming. She calls out to the driver in front:
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry! My fault!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Shaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and FRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to drive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window. Kimberly spins around, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with chilling intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking freak." The Old Woman's PLASTIC BAG BREAKS, sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp. The Old
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view mirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?

CU ON KIMBERLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic road sign that flashes "WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NISSAN SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow mini- bus carrying a high- school football team.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle each other, yelling:
</DIRECTION>
<FOOTBALL_PLAYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pile up! Pile up! Pile up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOOTBALL_PLAYERS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at earsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and reach to lower the volume.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, is this tribute to Princess Di Day or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANO>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into the back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
(unnerved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, all the crazies are out today.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around, taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you no drugs in the car! My dad will freak!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANO>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you should have specified.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly turns to Shaina, helpless. Shaina spins around, her eyes wordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kimberly? It's Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Dad. What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Dano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an unexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing at hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES HER TITS at Dano over:
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it. Take care of it.

</MR_BURROUGHS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<DIRECTION>
Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him. He lowers the joint at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
<DIRECTION>
(hiding bag of weed in pants)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANO>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look first, idiot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANO>
<DIRECTION>
Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignore 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<DIRECTION>
ON LOG TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement, sparking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls in behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dano, put that out NOW.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE EXPEDITION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I won't be able to pitch the campaign. Let's get Silverstein to come in and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell? No, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing her vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat turns and looks at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the cop doing? Did he see that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANO>
<DIRECTION>
Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it, I'll call him myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a number...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas speaks into his radio.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DISPATCHER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No biggie. Drake called in sick.

</DISPATCHER>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Copy that.

<DIRECTION>
(switches off; annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, sleep it off Drake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard, but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and closer to the edge of the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dano nervously looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light begins flickering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This trip better be wor th it. What's the guy- girl ratio again?

</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly stops mid-sentence when the WHITE VAN in front of her suddenly SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES and pulls onto the shoulder for no reason. Kimberly SCREAMS, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident. Frankie instinctively SHOUTS at the van.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your problem, ya fuckin' crack baby?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE WHITE VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are marked: In Memory of Flight 180.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...couldn't Keep your dick in check for another month? I knew this would happen when I got pregnant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She pounds the steering wheel, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd the doctor say? I have to come in to test for STDs? Goddamn
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you, Jorge.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry of sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals shower the visor of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed bugs) around his visor and drops back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads, "DRUNK DRIVING KILLS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter from the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN against it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS Kimberly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gas it around these idiots. We do have 1200 miles to go, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a SUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically SMASHING two toy cars together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars by, startling her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE PACER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with two ten-ounce Naya bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tim, will you cut that out? I can't even hear myself think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, we'll be there soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Tim drops the Naya bottles on the seat. One of them quietly falls to the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette. She passes it on the left. Frankie rolls down his window.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever hear of the Ozone layer, asshole?

<DIRECTION>
INSIDE CHEVETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD case. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he reflexively taps the brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running down along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with logs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE COP CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch.

</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE TRANS AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly, clearly making Frankie jealous.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.

</FRANKIE>
<DANO>

Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window.
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch.

Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him.

	Hey, thanks for talking me into this trip. Ever since my mom... I dunno, I just feel like I'm starting to live again, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Shaina smiles in understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE POLICE CRUISER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and out the back, taking Thomas' head with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right in front of the yellow mini-bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a MACK TRUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch. Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in/half onto the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from the Chevette. She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but hits it broadside --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the side window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORA'S PACER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of Kat's Expedition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a huge fireball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIMBERLY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The semi's grill comes right at her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU ON KIMBERLY

She screams and we --

The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.

<DIRECTION>
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin. Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which BREAKS, exactly like before, and the Old Woman scurries after them. The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.
</DIRECTION>

THE HIGHWAY ON RAMP

Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her surroundings.

The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids ad-lib "Let's go", "Fucking freak."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin. Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges, which breaks, exactly like before and the Old Woman scurries after them.

The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.

</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
HONK! The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van, the Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile up. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial.
</DIRECTION>

The opening guitar riff to HIGHWAY TO HELL blares from the speakers. Kimberly turns to Shaina with a "believe me know?" look, but Shaina's nowhere near on the same page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HONKING behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, shaking like a leaf, pulls the SUV forwards, turning it sideways to block off all traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANO>
<DIRECTION>
Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously cruising up the shoulder of the onramp. He shoves a bag of weed, along with the joint, down his pants.

Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle.

	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<KIMBERLY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.

Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her."
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss, please step out of the vehicle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a delivery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABELLA>

Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it.

<ISABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>

(good-natured laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, quit it already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>

Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past. She grabs at Thomas for emphasis.

</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in horror and collapses against the SUV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas runs to his patrol car.
</DIRECTION>

The White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into her cell phone.

Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the SUV.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kimberly, what's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAINA>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly moves toward Shaina's window. As she leans her head into Shaina's window, an ominous BREEZE blows back their hair and we hear the BLARING HORN of a TRUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by Thomas!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From nowhere, a SHRIEK of BRAKES as a JACK-KNIFED TRUCK plow s the SUV across the frame! CRASH! Flying debris misses Kimberly and Thomas by inches!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up in the wreckage.

CHAOS. Evan, the driver of the Trans Am, impatiently speaks to DETECTIVE SUBY, late 40s, professional with an open face that makes him a great listener.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you want from me. Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there'd be an accident and there was. Big deal. Even a broken watch is right twice a day...

Officer Thomas Burke passes by, heading into --

INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kat, Eugene, Nora, Tim, and Rory sit in a large room, waiting to give statements. Unlike Evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught.

PAN OVER TO REVEAL KIMBERLY. She's still in shock, her mind far away. Thomas sits close to her, speaking softly.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me again how it started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember what triggered it all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.

</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Something clicks for Thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly, like a lawyer leading a friendly witness.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew? You just mean a hunch, right? A bad vibe, maybe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
The other drivers stare at Kimberly.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More than that. All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lookin g at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.

But the others listen intently now. Especially Kat, who spies her headset buried deep in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...

<DIRECTION>
(swallows; hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Kimberly sighs and looks down. The room becomes eerily silent, except for the FLICKER of a florescent light.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this sounds crazy...but you all heard about Flight 180, right? The kid who got off the plane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling CRASH as Rory, le aning back in his chair, tips over. Thomas rolls his eyes as Rory grins sheepishly and picks himself up.

<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is where it starts to get freaky. So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one. 'Cause when your number's up, it's up, right? Some people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EUGENE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone tenses up.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not quite all of them. Clear Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook.

Detective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable.

	Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.

	Never mind.

	I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_SUBY>
<DIRECTION>
But Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBER_LY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Which means Death could be coming for us.

<DETECTIVE_SUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way to console the witnesses Burke.

</DETECTIVE_SUBY>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket and wave goodbye to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_SUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn unlucky.

<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if it's true? What if it's happening all over again?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed, stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>

</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with you people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door, the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence. Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside. Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kimberly...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take her home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_SUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, you can all go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE_SUBY>
<DIRECTION>
By now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>

	First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea before her. Both are shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling.

</KIMBERLY>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<KIMBERLY>

INT. EVAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell. Evan appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some packages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he climbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK apparently left by some kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing Evan to lean against -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan slowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just misses it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself and continues down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small packages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it, who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to the fridge and grabs a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a grease-filled frying pan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out HEY E.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food - the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the microwave and turns it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his packages...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

<DIRECTION>
A CLICK, then hold MUZAK: AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MAGNET in Chinese fo od. SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And ugly sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He slides it over his wrist, admiring it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON KNIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about an inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond encrusted horseshoe ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is FLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION from the microwave startles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When he tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He continues yanking... Stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His fingers reach for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it threatens to turn on one of the switches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FINGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on. And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out, knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<EVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He begins COUGHING in the smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears a creak and looks up just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire completely engulfs the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape. He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest level, intact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180 "survivors".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?" "Bizarre Coincidence?" describing the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the word, "PREMONITION" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_SUBY>
<DIRECTION>
(as if entranced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department.

</DETECTIVE_SUBY>
<DIRECTION>
Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas, embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've made your point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DETECTIVE_SUBY>

<DETECTIVE_SUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas looks stunned.

Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream.

A GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting back tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV -- but she stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>

Nora swallows, trying to seem brave.

	Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all.

<DIRECTION>
But neither of them are convinced.

<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs it in.

<DIRECTION>
INT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again.

Mr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>

Mr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective.

<MR_BURROUGHS>

	You know, after your mother died...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	things I th ought about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away.

(choking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BURROUGHS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING out of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr. Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there is none. And he leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and turns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A porch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in bed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of a...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling. Shadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from the VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously turns on her computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STONEYBROOK HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to "Stoneybrook Hospital".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow her inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIGN offers a choice between "Emergency/Medica l Care" or "Psychiatric Treatment Center." Kimberly drives to the mental ward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MENTAL WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor. The Physician consults a clipboard.
</DIRECTION>
<PHYSICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYSICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and punches "4514" into the electronic lock. They continue down another corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G.
</DIRECTION>
<PHYSICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications.

Kimberly nods, hands it over.
</DIRECTION>
<PHYSICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I think we're all done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYSICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in another code.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Is she...dangerous or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<PHYSICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No honey, but she expects you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHYSICIAN>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<PHYSICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends on her, I guess. She's voluntary.

The door hisses open.

INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL CLEAR RIVERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her former self. Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic paranoia. Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. Bordering on savage. Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by something unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear Rivers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight 180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as seen in the opening title montage).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.

<CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
(snicker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gives Kimberly the once over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I doubt you'll survive that long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What list?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Clear's eyes bore into a terrified Kimberly's.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
(sudden realization)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exact order? Then I'm next! I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear backs away from Kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you said someone else died last night. That means Death skipped past you. Someone must have intervened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Kimberly's confusion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly nods, recalling the events.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That still doesn't make sense. You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear seems very disturbed by that.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's moving backwards? Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE PILE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora's Pacer folds like an accordion, then EXPLODES, followed by Evan screaming in the Trans Am, which gets CREAMED by the semi!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:

Kimberly, shaken, does the math.

<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died first, then Evan and then...my friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear is oblivious when Kimberly breaks into silent sobs.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Backwards...that's new.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Kimberly's confusion)

	<DIALOGUE>
	For the signs.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Signs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your- face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and death.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The songs on the radio.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant, we see a gentle side of Clear.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's obvious you know what you're talking about. You beat it. You have to help us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. That's the worst killer of them all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you say that? What kind of monster are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
At once, Clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My family is dead. My friends are dead. And Alex...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly. While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a gruesome picture on its own.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yes, that's the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Clear pounds on the door, apparently done with Kimberly. A GUARD opens the door. Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons her courage and turns back to Clear.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what? I think you're a coward. I think you hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to care about another
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	living soul. In my opinion, you're already dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly leaves, giving Clear something to think about.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a STRANGE CAR parked there. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the house. He guiltily backs away as Kimberly gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried calling last night but your father --

Suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a scene out of THE BIRDS, Kimberly must duck and cover as the pigeons assault her from every angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual pigeons, THEY'RE GONE. ALL IN HER HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<KI_MBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing.

Woman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of the steel side panels, untying it...

<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try, kiddo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DANGLING SHOELACE heads straight for the escalator grate. IT GETS SWALLOWED UP. As Tim steps off, Nora TRIPS forward. Her caught sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the stubby one.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>

	Sure hon. I'm fine. Let's shake it, we're late.
	</DIALOGUE>

Tim nods. The wind picks up as they continue past a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONSTRUCTION CREW

Tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass JACKHAMMERS, a CEMENT MIXER, and an EXCAVATOR.

<DIRECTION>
The RECEPTIONIST appears next to the fallen fish food with a VACUUM. She plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A startling GRIND as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. She vacuums up the fish food around Nora's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEAD FISH gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which sputters and stops. The water level RISES, spilling water over the side of the tank. The water TRICKLES closer to the outlet.

<DIRECTION>
Tim looks petrified as Dr. Lees unveils a tray full of PICS, CARVERS and EXTRACTING FORCEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The KA-CHUNG of construction outside makes it im possible to concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, Dr. Lees picks up a pic and mirror and starts examining Tim's mouth. CU of PIC gently prodding Tim's teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_LEES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little disappointed, Tim. Does your mom know you've been smoking?

Tim groans "uh-uh", then suddenly flinches.

<DR_LEES>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that'll have to be filled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LEES>
<DIRECTION>
A BANG from the window startles Dr. Lees. His HAND JERKS, but luckily the pic was removed from Tim's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Lees whips around in time to see a PIGEON flutter away from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_LEES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Every day at the same damn time. Now this'll only sting for a moment.

Dr. Lees picks up a large SYRINGE and moves it toward Tim's open mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_LEES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open big. Wiiiiider...

</DR_LEES>

Tim's eyes radiate fear. The MOUTH OPENS. Reluctantly. Tim nervously eyes the window as the needle enters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEEDLE heading toward his gumline --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! Another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. Dr. Lees' hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue. Tim squirms violently. Dr. Lees looks towards the window angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_LEES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell do they expect me to... Would you rather have the laughing gas?

BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE

BANG! SFX: BROKEN GLASS - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed through the window. In the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_LEES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_LEES>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Lees marches out of the room to investigate. Another quick electrical surge and the OXYGEN COMPRESSOR flutters off. The needle drops. But the NITROUS flow remains strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON FISH MOBILE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning from a new breeze. Suddenly, a small round PUFFER FISH FALLS directly into Tim's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soft, gurgling and choking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly right. Dr. Lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to make sure nobody saw...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they doing here? And why are they yelling "pigeons"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his mangled body visible underneath.
</DIRECTION>

As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS.

EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER

Emergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a stretcher into an ambulance.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her hand and watches it tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happening again. It's fucking
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	happening again. I hoped we'd get there and they'd be okay, that Clear Rivers was full of shit and Evan's death was just a freak accident...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas kills the engine to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses he's losing her, and softens her approach.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in. BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear stare each other down.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.

Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly.

</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is this guy, anyway?

</THOMAS>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear open the large wooden doors into a small chapel, creat ing a loud CREAK. A corpse in an open casket sits at the front of the chapel, post -wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to get to a side door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway. An ORANGE GLOW flickers from the far room. The unmistakable sounds of a furnace make it all the more eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They edge closer. They peek inside the --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CREMATORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oddly there is no one there. As they enter, passing the furnace, a momentary WHOOSH of flames startles them all!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They jump back - bumping right into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. BLUDWORTH, the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has inexplicably appear BEHIND THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an eye out for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying EVAN'S EYELESS BODY toward the firing oven. Kimberly and Thomas are scared.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear, however, seems to expect nothing less.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come to... Pick my brain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's mouth. And YANKS out a gold tooth. Kimberly recoils as he discards the bloody tooth on a metal tray.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>

(not falling for this again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend.

</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
The Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear. He crosses the room and hits a LEVER. KA- CHUNK! The oven begins to blaze.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you cheat Death once and for all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead. But still fresh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body. Clear has had about enough.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Mortician)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we drove a long way to get here. So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
The Mortician now CLAMPS THE PLIERS around Evan's NIPPLE RING.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what purpose? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door. You can't cheat Death; there
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	are no escapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. You told me Death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable. But Alex and I cheated Death not once, but dozens of times. If the design is flawed, it can be beaten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
A sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips. He yanks the nipple ring OFF! Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such fire in you now. People are always most alive just before they die. Don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can be beaten. And you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
CREEEAAAK -SLAM! The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some say that there is a balance to everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
His words hang in the air. An ominous BREEZE enters.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their confusion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about? The Mortician focuses on Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Evan's other eye POPS , startling Thomas and Kimberly.

	What the hell does that mean?

<DIRECTION>
(with finality)

	<DIALOGUE>
	To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Mortician grabs Kimberly.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORTICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Mortician finally lets Kimberly go.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One last question. Why is Death working backwards this time?

<DIRECTION>
The Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex.

From the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for signs of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY CUT-OFF VALVE

Some SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out.

	New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?

<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<CLEAR>

	I know, it worries me that I understand him.

Thomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground. Quick looks all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a match.

The words slowly take affect. Kimberly becomes centered, getting her breath back, and speaks without a hitch.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.

	So let's do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(realization)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?

INT. A/V ROOM - POLICE STATION - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas works a VCR, scanning BACKWARDS through the video footage from the patrol car camera. We see the SUV's explosive collision with the jack- knifed semi. Kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the crash.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas sees Kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh...sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly notices Clear watching her and toughens up. She forces back the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know. We need my eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear sits beside Kimberly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. I'll take watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's already buried the need to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay. Just caught me by surprise. Put it back on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Clear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taken care of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
THE MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down the onramp.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past the White Van. A clean shot of the license plate. Jackpot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame by frame.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. Why is everything happening so fast? After Flight 180. A month went by before anyone died. And now five people are dead in less than a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas' computer screen finally fills with information.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
They all get up and leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ominously, THE MONITOR shows the NEXT VEHICLE creeping behind Nora's Pacer - a white van!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRUZ HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. Thomas, Kimberly and Clear get out and start up the unlit path. It's dark, hard to see where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning the walkway.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's lay this on her gently now. The stress alone could upset the pregnancy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when AUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate from within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and purposefully to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at the last second by its owner -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's BARKING:
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Jorge Cruz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. What's this about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May we come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. What's this about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile floor. She takes in what she can see of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn. Furniture over-turned.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(a little stern)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
But by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares through the house, into a bedroom and sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge is already closing the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past Jorge's grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!!! You can't go in there!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes a closer look at Clear.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We never meant to hurt you Isa...You're not Isabella!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to sue your ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose blood is that on the floor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Defensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Isabella? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge flinches. It's time to come clean.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the fight about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're wasting time with this piece of shit. Let's just get to the meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Clear mutters something as they exit the house.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can only pray it doesn't come out retarded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Jorge hisses something at the Rotty, which CHARGES them and SPRINGS! But Thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rory sits in his Chevette outside an apartment building, staring up at the address. He quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes his nostrils free of crystals. He takes a breath and exits the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rory follows some PEOPLE into the elevator. The elevator doors close on his shoe -- trapping Rory in an awkward position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One MAN frantically pushes the DOORS OPEN button to no avail. Finally, as the elevator rises, Rory YANKS his foot free.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ. I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rory bends down and inspects his shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<RORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, is that dogshit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RORY>
<DIRECTION>
Rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the Man's face - see? - before disgustedly slipping it back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DING. The doors open. The man hurries out and the elevator DOORS CLOSE on Rory's smirking face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL - Nora, Rory, and Kat, mortified, sit on a couch. It's obvious the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. Clear and Kimberly await their reactions. Nora raises a trembling hand.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anybody have a Valium?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll want to take --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nora pops it in her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- half of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement. Across the loft, Thomas paces, phone in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly, into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any word yet on the Dodge van? Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene alone seems unafraid. He uses a GRABBER - a long pole with movable claw on the end - to OPEN THE SKYLIGHT. When done, he balances the long pole precariously against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OMINOUS BREEZE enters. Clear notices MAGAZINE PAGES blowing over the desk by the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that would mean... I'm next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<EUGENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's next. This is crazy. First death's stalking us and now premonitions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EUGENE>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can't be happening. My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<RORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RORY>
<DIRECTION>
Kat's hands ball into fists. The hatred is mutual. Clear reaches for a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing MAGAZINE PAGES blowing over until their weight tips over a PENCIL HOLDER which spills pens out. She takes the box to Nora.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not next, Nora. Nobody has to be next. That's the point. Last time, we didn't plan. We weren't organized. Now we can help each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to Nora and the others.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think what would have happened if Kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Nora's head falls. Kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is, as long as you know what to beware of, you have a fighting chance. It can be beaten. If I call you and say subway, get to a high rise fast. A place where no subway could possibly go, get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone nods in understanding. Rory fidgets, sniffling, then POUNDS the table in frustration. Startling Kat.
</DIRECTION>
<RORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the first place? That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RORY>

Clear, very alert, looks at the tipped PENCIL HOLDER. PENS ROLL toward the end of the desk, toward a large White Pages directory which hangs precariously off the edge just so.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone read today's paper? The article on Evan Shaeffer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
No one says a word.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.

<CLEAR>

<KIMBERLY>

INT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ISABELLA'S PREGNANT BELLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on the motel phone. A disturbing metallic SQUEAK SCRAPE -SQUEAK can be heard, nearly drowning out the SCREAMING COUPLE next door.
</DIRECTION>
<ISABELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ISABELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Isabella hangs up, recoiling at VIOLENT THUMPS against her wall. PULL BACK AND UP TO REVEAL the source of the unsettling SQUEAK is a rickety, wobbling CEILING FAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly whispers into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. I love you too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. Clear keeps her eyes on the pens that ROLL on the slightly canted table into the about-to -fall White Pages directory.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
The pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips over and PLOPS HEAVILY onto a GOOSE-DOWN THROW PILLOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze. Everyone in the room watches them rise.
</DIRECTION>
<RORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like Forrest Gump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RORY>
<DIRECTION>
They float across the room, ultimately landing on a MOUSETRAP! SNAP! The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a LARGE SWORDFISH mounted on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted SWORDFISH. The supporting brackets give, causing the SWORDFISH TO TIP and SLIDE DOWNWARD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs!
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The institution's made me soft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
Clear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. Eugene isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us.

<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need her. She's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot!

Kimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst. Clear, however, looks grateful.

	We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts.

MONTAGE - SAFEPROOFING THE APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp objects away, affix padding to chart corners...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box, nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. Thomas watches as he takes a hanging mirror off the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw this. I'm going outside for a smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you should? It's not safe out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAT>
<DIRECTION>
Kat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and grabs it just in case. Thomas smiles 'good job' at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when Nora rises from the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket. Kimberly looks concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going, Nora? You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Nora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim. There's nothing left for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain.

<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that. Once you lose hope, it's already too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene snickers. Nora looks up, anger surfacing.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then I can accept that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't give up. Don't accept Death's plan. Trust me, you can fight this. If we can just survive long enough until that baby is born, we can --

Nora looks more resolute than ever.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to prepare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks crushed when Nora heads for the door. Except Eugene, who stands up as well.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, why am I listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house?
	</DIALOGUE>

Eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times. Nora nervously ties her long hair back in a single braid.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RORY, standing on the couch, pulls a POLICE ACADEMY DIPLOMA off the wall - and slips - stumbling BACKWARDS into the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staggering, he accidentally knocks some COAT HANGARS and a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY from the high shelf to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas whips around and sees that Rory's not hurt. He then lowers his gaze and sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figurine of a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY is framed by a tangled jumble of wire COAT HANGARS. Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening. Oddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man with hooks emanating from his body. The sodium vapor lamp casts an OMINOUS GLOW around the image.

Kimberly and Clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp ominously FLICKERS OUT AND DIES.

The elevator finally comes. Eugene and Nora get inside, standing in front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of PROSTHETIC LIMBS.

Eugene stares blankly at the CONCAVE MIRROR in the upper corner. He's disturbed by the WARPED REFLECTION OF:

THE GAUNT MAN leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally close, he leans over and SMELLS it. Creepy.

	Um, by the way, your shoe's untied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EUGENE>

Nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). She tries tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell phone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then looks embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>

But Nora's too frightened to speak. Eugene grabs the phone, hearing unintelligible STATIC.

Nora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer... As the door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets snagged on one of the PROSTHETIC HOOKS, YANKING her backwards.

Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid. Nora desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the elevator.

Kat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<KAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You alright, Nora?

The elevator DOORS begin to close, and CLAMP around Nora's neck, her head inside, body outside the elevator.

The UP BUTTON is lit. Clear rushes to the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Elevator RISES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level - then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try to pull her back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering away as the body convulses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A bloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.
</DIRECTION>

The sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND POUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator.

He PULLS THE TRIGGER. CLICK! Eugene tries again. CLICK!

Thomas looks stunned as Eugene goes through every round, CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLI CK...

Thomas makes another phone call. In the corner, Eugene shivers to himself. Desperately looking for signs of danger. He looks over to Clear.

BRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward the accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires.

Brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK TREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a double-wide construction trailer.

To the crash site. Brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight of a guy and a girl dragging a blood- soaked man from the back seat to perform CPR on him.

<DIRECTION>
The color drains from Brian's face as the dying man on the ground coughs blood and the girl performing CPR recoils.
</DIRECTION>

The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face. Into the street --
</DIRECTION>

Brian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped leg. He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to YANK the door open with all his might.

Kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette -- which bounces along the hard dirt -- toward the oncoming gas. Closer, closer,.. The BREEZE KICKS UP, aiding the cigarette.

WHOOSH, the gas fuse catches. The blusih flame travels through pipes, over rocks, racing toward the news VAN.

Kimberly , half-traumatized, watches an ominous BREEZE rustle through the field, up to the trees, toward Thomas.

The GAS BURNS up an incline, and disappears into the ground... And pops up twenty feet closer to the News Van.

Kimberly follows the BREEZE to the dead oak tree under which Thomas stands. And blows a large branch until it snaps! A startled Thomas sees it fall just in time to DIVE to safety.

Eugene tries to watch a news flash of HIS accident on the TV across the room, but a bulky ORDERLY blocks his view.

<DIRECTION>
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him, again obscuring his view. Eugene frantically pantomimes writing.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need a pen? Sure. If you like, I'll bring crosswords for you, too.

Finally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the TV. An ANCHOR MAN taps his pages on the desktop.
</DIRECTION>
<ANCHOR_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANCHOR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
A WEATHERMAN dressed as a frog points out cloud formations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing the huge cart out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a SKIDDING CAR fills the room. It comes from the TV which shows a PSA featuring CRASH TEST DUMMIES.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez, it's freezing in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, VENTS CLOSE just below the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON OXYGEN HOSE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bursting. It HISSES softly. We follow the OBLIVIOUS ORDERLY out of the room.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hospital ADMINISTRATOR briskly strides up to the Orderly.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMINISTRATOR>

	What are you doing? The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward --

<ADMINISTRATOR>

</ADMINISTRATOR>

The Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. The Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HUGE CART. Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room.

Kimberly seems to have ditched the cops. She speeds the pick up through the medical facility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital. Kimberly, Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OXYGEN HOSE hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the TV. Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial ends. The n, a NEWS REPORT comes on. The BANNER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROUTE 18 TRAGEDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons, and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mor e tears were shed this morning in the wake of yesterday's tragedy that rocked the Tri -State area...

</ANCHOR_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the FRAYED ELECTRIC CORD of Eugene's TV begins sparking. The sound DROPS OUT, the picture SPUTTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene goes white with terror. He looks back to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The broken OXYGEN TUBE. HISSING softly. The BEEPS of the EEG machine frantically increase. Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch. Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NURSES STATION - DAY

Clear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk.

Clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and seizes the computer. Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>

Kimberly and Thomas hurry to the elevator banks...then reconsider and enter the stairwell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene scratches the top sheet of the bed, trying to inch the call- switch closer and closer to him. But it won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and disappears by his stomach!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pounds desperately on the empty food tray, his side rails, looks toward the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the door, you can't hear a thing in the bustling hallway as people rush by. Kimberly and Thomas rush past his door, lost.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry, I think she's this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO EUGENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes scream insanely, but he respirator tube prevents any sound from escaping him. And that's when the RAT appears on the floor and begins gnawing on the respirator's power cord!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Eugene sees this, the EEG machine climbs off the charts.
</DIRECTION>

The rat GNAWS away at Eugene's power cord, Eugene looks trapped, helpless, tortured.

His eyes dart from the sparking TV to the gnawed power cord to the useless call- switch.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Clear walks up and down the corridor, scanning room numbers as she passes. A -169, A- 171, A-173...

<CLEAR>

	B-187...B-187...

A HAND suddenly GRABS Clear and shoves her against the wall. REVEAL A SECURITY GUARD leering at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just where do you think you're going?

Clear struggles to get away, getting sympathetic looks from an OLD MAN walking a rolling IV STAND down the corridor.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear plays possum, offering no resistance to the Security Guard as the Old Man wheels his IV STAND along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Clear grabs the stand - and WHAMS the heavy wheeled base into the Guard's BALLS! As the Guard recoils, she thoughtfully hands the IV back to the Old Man and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELIVERY ROOM 0 CON

The Nurse is startled when Kimberly and Thomas BURST THROUGH the door. In the BG, a puzzled Steve peeks inside until Kimberly pulls the door closed.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing in here? Get the hell out! Right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to swaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking Isabella.
</DIRECTION>
<OBSTETRICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isabella, look down and see your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBSTETRICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
To the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST INTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a magical moment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EUGENE'S PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense relief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt pocket and lighting a victory cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the delivery room as Clear runs up to them.

	New life defeats death. We've done it. Death has to rewrite the list. We're safe.

</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Steve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and HUGS the others. Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her. Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNKOWN POV

<DIRECTION>
Looking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined!

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT

Kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her trance. Thomas helps her to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay? You just face planted!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how it feels to be dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Her lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably. Clear sees TWO SECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others toward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?

</THOMAS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't...what if I made a mistake?

</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible. She was on the onramp.

</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly, overcome with self- doubt.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you remember anything about it?

Kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering:

EXT. LAKE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
POV DRIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. Drowning. Horrible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And on the rearview mirror, six floral scented AIR-FRESHNERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly looks down at her grease -covered hands and looks ill.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the Same hands from the van.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally everything makes sense to Clear.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you Kimberly. The premonitions are about you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kimberly trembles, refusing to accept what she's hearing.

	No! It can't be.

<CLEAR>

<DIRECTION>
Clear leaves Kimberly and Thomas together. Kimberly verges on tears and Thomas consoles her with a hug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACKGROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor. She comes to a room with a HUGE CART parked outside, blocking the door. She looks up to see - B -187.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CLEAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eugene? Are you in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>
<DIRECTION>
EUGENE'S ROOM

<CLEAR>

	Can you hear me? I'm coming in .
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEAR>

An intense wave of relief washes over Eugene.

As Kimberly hugs Thomas, she watches Clear push the cart past the door.

<ORDERLY>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make way, make way lovebirds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly spins as Eugene's Orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a crossword book in one hand, A BIRTHDAY CAKE in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAKE reads "Happy Birthday Gregory". The THIRTEEN SPARKLING CANDLES on top ODDLY FRAME Clear's head.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Orderly speeds down the corridor toward Clear, whose hand reaches for Eugene's door handle. She leans into it --

	Thanks hon, the Henzels are going crazy for this thing.

THOMAS AND KIMBERLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watch as Clear opens the door, briefly revealing Eugene, a whoosh of Oxygen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clear's body is obscenely hurled END OVER END towards the CAMERA, heading straight for Kimberly and Thomas!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being crushed by Clear's lifeless body!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hospital erupts in total chaos. Just as Kimberly is about to break down completely, she sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly sees the nametag: KALARJIAN.

ANGLE ON CART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEFRIBULATOR PADDLES rest on top. And then Dr. Kalarjian passes them toward the area of the explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIMBERLY OMINOUSLY TURNS, the camera following her view, until she sees a small lake across the street from the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. That's it. The lake. The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, an AMBULANCE SKIDS up to the nearest entrance. PARAMEDICS jump out and run towards the blast site.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
But Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at the --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMBULANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from her vision! And it's running!
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to do this.

Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns and runs before he can speak.

Kimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost seems to swing open for her as she gets in.

Thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart.

Kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance, rushes outside.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the lake!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE AMBULANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE LAKE'S EDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

KIMBERLY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same POV as the premonition.

Kimberly turns her head to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOMAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking wet). Thomas doesn't respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS UPRIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kimberly?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved, he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>

Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital. Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an ethereal glow. There are no more doubts; they've won.

They exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic hospital.

Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer is deep in his mouth --

<MR_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone.

<DIRECTION>
(looking around, lowering voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, if you can beat Death,
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	what's he got to worry about me for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife, MRS. GIBBONS, joins.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you still never explained to us how you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, technically when we died, we gave Death what it wanted. And by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She changes the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm having the greatest day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIBBONS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons. Big props to you and Brian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<MRS_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our...pleasure. So, ready for the back-to -school season? NYU, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIBBONS>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three short glorious weeks away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<MRS_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds wonderful. I wish I were going myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIBBONS>
<MR_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mr. Burroughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, Bob. Our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks grave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Among other places.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
A chorus of friendly laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad used to call her the pincushion. From Hellraiser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
BRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, you had the spatula last, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MR_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian looks like he's having fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<MR_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure does. Owes it to that friend of yours, in a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Gibbons immediately regrets having said that.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<MR_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day...but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
Kimberly and Thomas ominously turn their heads around. In the BG, Brian fidgets in front of the barbecue.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GIBBONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never told me that, Peter. Boy, that was lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GIBBONS>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening silence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons' plate. PLOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END CREDITS.
