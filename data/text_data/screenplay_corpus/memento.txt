INT. DERELICT HOUSE - DAY (COLOUR SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again the picture is FANNED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a POLAROID CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy- breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth should be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself into the face of TEDDY (40's, moustache)and we-

<DIRECTION>
Leonard drives, consulting his Polaroid photos.

EXT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - DAY (COLOUR SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard, BROWN ENVELOPE in hand, finds the door to room 304.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - DAY (COLOUR SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard enters, looks around as if for the first time. An anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a HAND-DRAWN CHART showing the layout of some streets, and stuck to the edges of the chart are POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS, with ARROWS DRAWN from each photograph to a spot on the map.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard inspects the photos. Some are buildings, some are people. All have the HANDWRITTEN NOTES on the broad white strip underneath the image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard gets Polaroids out of his pocket. The first one is of the Discount Inn. He STICKS it onto an already-squashed lump of blue tack at the end of an ARROW drawn from a location on the outskirts of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second photo is a blurred shot of a Brunette turning in a doorway. The name NATALIE is written under the picture. Leonard flips it over. On the back are two handwritten messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over, but the other one reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. He steps back looking over the Polaroids one by one: Natalie, Burt, Discount Inn, Teddy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard sits at the desk and opens the BROWN ENVELOPE. He takes out a photocopy of a CAR REGISTRATION and a DRIVER'S LICENSE. Both are in the name of JOHN EDWARD GAMMELL, but when Leonard looks at the picture on the license, he recognizes the face. Leonard moves back to his wall chart, finds the Polaroid of Teddy and compares it to the license photo.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy told me his name was Teddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the back. It says only:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard smiles. He goes to the phone and dials the number on the Polaroid. A couple of rings, then it's answered.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Gammell?

	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE FACTS:"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard removes his jacket, then starts pulling off his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has WRITING TATTOOED ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS. MESSAGES in different styles of writing, some CRUDE, some ELABORATE. The messages run in all directions, some UPSIDE- DOWN, some BACKWARDS. Leonard examines his tattoos, methodically. From Leonard's POV, the most striking is an upside-down tattoo on his BELLY which says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"PHOTOGPAPH: HOUSE, CAR, FRIEND, FOE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one FOREARM it says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE FACTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FACT 1. MALE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FACT 2. WHITE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other FOREARM:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"FACT 3. FIRST NAME: JOHN OR JAMES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FACT 4. LASTNAME: G-------"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard pulls down his trousers. On his right THIGH, crudely- lettered:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"FACT 5. DRUG DEALER"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And immediately below this, in elegant, neat lettering:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard takes out the REGISTRATION DOCUMENT and examines it. Holding the photo of Teddy and the registration document, Leonard checks off his TATTOOED FACTS:
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White... male. First name... John. Last name... G for Gammell. Drugs. License plate.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks document against tattoo on thigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SG... 13... 7... IU. It's him. It's actually him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard looks coldly at Teddy's smiling image.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found you, you fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard turns the photo face down, takes a pen and writes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"HE IS THE ONE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard drops the pen. Thinks. He looks at his chest through the mirror and a backwards tattoo suddenly BECOMES CLEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard buttons his blue shirt, then writes on the back of Teddy's picture:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"KILL HIM"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks the GUN in the back of his waistband.
</DIRECTION>

Leonard, in his boxers and plaid work shirt, shaving foam on thigh, drops his disposable razor and cautiously picks up the RINGING PHONE.

Leonard pulls his shirt off. There is a BANDAGE on his LEFT ARM. He looks do at the TATTOOS ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS.

<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can't remember talking to you. What did we talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sammy Jankis. Yeah, I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand. Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.

<DIRECTION>
Leonard touches the tattoo on the back of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless notes. But he'd get mixed up. I've got a more graceful solution to the memory problem. I'm disciplined and organized. I use habit and routine to make my life possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason to make it work.
	</DIALOGUE>

Leonard can see his reflection in the mirror. He studies the tattoo across his chest:
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard parks the Jaguar, gets out, stops outside the door to a restaurant, checking its name against a NOTE, written on a SMALL PAPER BAG FROM A PHARMACY. The note says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"CITY GRILL, MAIN ST. THURSDAY, 1.OOPM MEET NATALIE FOR INFO"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks the note in his pocket and pulls out his Polaroid photographs. He flips through them until he finds Natalie's. Leonard flips the picture over. On the back are two handwritten messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over, the second reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN STREET - DAY (COLOUR SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard enters, walking slowly down the aisle, looking at all the customers. He makes eye contact with a WOMAN (brunette, 30's)sitting alone, wearing SUNGLASSES. Her face betrays nothing. Leonard walks past. She sighs and grabs the back of his jacket as he passes. Leonard spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Natalie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard slips into the seat opposite her. Natalie is pretty, but has bruising around one eye, and a mark on her lip.

Leonard raises his eyebrows, then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I probably told you how much I hated it. Could you take off your sunglasses? It's just hard for me -
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie takes them off to reveal her bruises.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</NATALIE>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you have information for me?

<LEONARD>

Leonard is surprised.

<LEONARD>

	It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry I can't remember you. It's not personal.

<NATALIE>

<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you shouldn't have to ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.

</NATALIE>
<LEONARD>

(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes, does it? My actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. My wife deserves vengeance, and it doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about her again.

</NATALIE>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

INT. LEONARD'S APARTMENT - DAY (COLOUR SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Random images of a woman (30's, black hair, plain). Jump cuts of details: a smile, eating, tucking her hair behind her ear, pulling on a pair of trousers, watching TV, shouting in anger. Sitting on the edge of the bed in her underwear, she TURNS as Leonard pinches her thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can only feel details. Bits and pieces which you didn't bother to put into words. And extreme moments you feel even if you don't want to. Put it together and you get the feel of the person, enough to know how much you miss them, and how much you hate the person who took them away.

Leonard watches Natalie leave. He sits at the table, looking down at the BROWN ENVELOPE and the MOTEL ROOM KEY (ROOM 304). Leonard rises, and heads to the restroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT RESTROOM - DAY (COLOUR SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard flushes the urinal, then moves to the sink and starts washing his hands. He notices a MESSAGE written on the back of his hand:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the message for a second, thoughtful, then tries to scrub the writing off his skin. To his surprise, it is INDELIBLE. Leonard looks at it, quizzical, then notices some markings on his wrists, pulling his sleeve back to get a better look. He can read the start of a message:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE FACTS:"
</DIRECTION>

Leonard is about to roll his sleeve up further when the restroom door opens and a MAN enters. Leonard dries his hands, then exits the rest room.

	I had to see through people's bullshit. It was useful experience, because now it's my life. When I meet someone, I don't even know if I've met them before. I have to look in their eyes and just figure them out. My job taught me that the best way to find out what someone knew was to let them talk.

	It's complicated. You might catch a sign but attach the wrong meaning to it. If someone touches their nose while they're talking, experts will tell you it means they're lying. It really means they're nervous, and people get nervous for all sorts of reasons. It's all about context.

<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. They collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions. Facts, not memories: that's how you investigate. I know, it's what I used to do. Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But I find something in my research: Conditioning. Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition. It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike, things you don't think about, you just get better through practice. Call it muscle memory, whatever, but it's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory. So I have the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning...

Leonard runs his finger over fact 6, then pulls his trousers up and looks around the room. He spots his suit jacket hanging over the back of a chair. He checks the pockets, pulls out his Polaroids, flips through them: a Jaguar, the Discount Inn, Natalie. He flips Natalie's picture over and looks at the back. There are two messages, but the first one has been completely scribbled over. The other one reads:

</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face, then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then wearily UNDRESSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING Dodd against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over. Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE POCKET.

Leonard STUMBLES in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around, HITTING Dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle, which does not break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his inside jacket pocket. Leonard stands above him, naked, dripping wet, catching his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a KNOCK at the door.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes "DODD" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket. He flips through them until he finds the one of Teddy, then picks up the phone and dials Teddy's number. The phone is answered:
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then a BEEP. Leonard does not look like he knows what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>

Leonard purses his lips in surprised frustration. He grabs his pen and scribbles on the back of Natalie's picture, obliterating the words:

	She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back.

	Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I look into Sammy's eyes, I don't see some vegetable, I see the same old Sammy. What do you think it's like for me to suspect that he's imagining this whole problem? That if I could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal? If I knew that my old Sammy was truly gone, then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy. As long as I have doubt, I can't say goodbye and move on.

	Yes, I will.

<TEDDY>

	No, you won't.

<LEONARD>

	When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!

<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought so too! I was sure you'd remember. But you didn't.

Beat. Leonard looks at Teddy, questioning.

<TEDDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, when we found your guy and killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, the real John G. Over a year ago. I helped you find him. He's already dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you keep lying to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your wife's death. I believed you, I thought you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife. We found him and you killed him. You didn't remember, so I helped you start looking again, looking for the guy you already killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who are you saying he was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him, I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard looks at the Polaroid of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the picture, right? I took that, right when you did it. Look how happy you are. Before you forgot. I wanted to see that face again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help. You lie to yourself! You don't want the truth, the truth is a fucking coward. So you make up your own truth. Look at your police file. It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took the 12 pages out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You took them out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name's Teddy.

<TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John G's for us to find. All you do is moan. I'm the one that has to live with what you've done. I'm the one that has to put it all together. You just wander around playing detective. You're living a dream, kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense of purpose to your life. A romantic quest which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard sticks the gun in Teddy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should kill you.

Leonard reaches into his sports bag, grabs a LIGHTER and sparks a flame. Leonard holds the PHOTO in the flame until it CATCHES LIGHT, MELTING and BLACKENING. The flames go out, having destroyed the entire image but for an arm resting on a floor. Leonard sticks the remnants into his jacket pocket. He looks in the rear-view mirror at Teddy, who scrabbles around in the bushes.

<DIRECTION>
Teddy's GREY SEDAN is parked in front of Leonard. Leonard looks at the sedan, then reaches into his sports bag for a PEN and a FILE CARD. He writes on the file card:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TATTOO: I'VE DONE IT"

Leonard looks from the card to Teddy's sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>

	In your case, Teddy... yes, I will.

</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard grabs the sports bag and GETS OUT of the PICKUP TRUCK. He goes to THE JAGUAR and OPENS the passenger door, DUMPING his sports bag onto the seat. Teddy SEES this and RUNS over. Leonard walks to the back of the Jaguar and holds up his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY>

Leonard pulls Teddy's EMPTY gun out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<LEONARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a murderer. I'm gonna hang on to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard TOSSES the GUN into the trunk. It lands on PILES OF BANKNOTES STUFFED IN THE TRUNK. Teddy REACTS to the sight of the money. Leonard glances at Teddy, then the money, shakes his head, then SLAMS the trunk. Teddy jogs back to where he was looking for his keys.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to believe in the world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there.

<DIRECTION>
Leonard CLOSES HIS EYES, driving blind. Stay on Leonard, not seeing the road ahead, hearing cars whip past.
</DIRECTION>

</LEONARD>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard OPENS his eyes, straightening up the car, BREATHING. His EYES DART from the STRIP MALLS to the GAS STATIONS, as if HE IS TRYING TO ABSORB THE WHOLE TOWN IN A SINGLE VIEWING.
</DIRECTION>
