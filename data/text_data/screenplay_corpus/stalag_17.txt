BARBED WIRE AGAINST A WINTRY NIGHT SKY

Beyond it, more barbed wire. Ice has formed on the strands. Now and then searchlight beams crisscross the pattern. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES along the double fence, SUPERIMPOSE -

<DIRECTION>
:SC: THE GREAT CAMP - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide expanse of barren ground checkered with clusters of barracks, sectioned off into compounds by double barbed-wire fences, nine feet high. Searchlights sweep over the barracks, the muddy ground with the snow patches, and the pine forest beyond the barbed-wire. The searchlights come from the goon towers -- little guard houses elevated on poles -- interspersed along the fences.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about you, but it always make me sore when I see those war pictures -- all about flying leather- necks and submarine patrols and frogmen and guerillas in the Philippines. I don't want to take anything away from those guys, but what gets me is that there never was a movie about P.O.W.s -- about prisoners of war. Now my name is Clarence Harvey Cook, -- they call me Cookie. I was shot down over Magdeburg, Germany back in 43. That's why I stammer a little once in a while, especially when I get excited and I always get excited when I talk about Stalag 17. I spent two and a half years in Stalag 17. Stalag is the Kraut word for prison camp and number 17 was somewhere near Krems on the Danube. There were about forty thousand P.O.W.s there, if...

OUR COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground the big gate. Above it a sign: STALAG 17- D. On both sides of the gate German guards in heavy coats, rifles slung over their shoulders. They stomp about in enormous boots with high cork soles to keep warm. Beyond the gate about eight low barracks form a U about the Appell- ground. They are primitive one-story wooden structures all set up on stilts about two feet high. From one of the buildings -- the Administration Building -- flies the swastika. In between the barracks are the wash latrines. A road runs through the slushy compound to the compound beyond.

A couple of German guards up there, one at the machine gun, the other working the searchlight.

<COOKIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you bothered to count the Russians and the Poles and the Czechs. In our Compound there were about six hundred and thirty of us -- all American airmen, all shot down by the Krauts -- radio operators, gunners and engineers -- all sergeants. Now you put six hundred and thirty sergeants together and boinnnnng! -- you've got yourself a situation! There was more fireworks shooting off around that place! Take for instance the story about the spy we had in our barrack. It was about a week before Christmas in '44 and two of our guys -- Manfredi and Johnson to be exact -- were just getting set to blow the joint...

THE HUNDEFUEHRER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A German guard plodding along inside the barbed wire with four mean mastiffs straining at the leash. The light from the goon tower grazes over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE OF THE BARRACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light sweeps slowly over the long shack. Catches the sign: BARACKE 4. Catches one of the doors, locked from outside with a heavy wooden bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE BARRACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunks on both sides. Tripledecked bunks. In the bunks seventy- five American P.O.W.s huddled in blankets. In between the bunks, in the little space left to them, crude tables, an iron stove, makeshift stools. Every inch crowded with whatever they have. Up above and all the way down the barrack hangs their wash. Over all of it, the heavy stench of seventy-five men cooped up. From outside through the broken, patched windows the searchlight sweeps over the bunks. The men are all asleep. Or are they?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FAR END OF THE BARRACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the strategic spot of the story. In the five tiers of bunks live our major characters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the upper bunk lies HOFFY. Little fellow. Plenty of authority. The Barrack Chief. His eyes are wide open. He is studying his wristwatch, the phosphorescent numerals shining in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the other bunks lie the others, wide awake, tense:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUKE, big bellyacher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRIZ, six-foot-three, ninety-eight pounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRICE, the barrack Security Chief. Quiet, touch of class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANFREDI, no cover, fully dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HARRY, bug-eyed, cocky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLONDIE, fair-skinned, boyish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNSON, fully dressed like Manfredi. Scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEFTON, casual. In his mouth a cold cigar butt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoffy again. Still staring at the wristwatch. This is the moment. He lifts the metal dogtags off his chest and jiggles them. This is the signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duke instantly slides out of the bunk, grabs up his blanket and moves toward the window. A searchlight beam sweeps across. Duke goes flush on the ground. The light passes on. Duke gets up again and starts hanging the blanket over the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the others go into action, silently, efficiently. Except for Manfredi and Johnson they are all in long winter underwear, some in slacks and socks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As for Sefton, he is lying in his bunk just watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blondie hangs a blanket over the window. Triz swings one over the clothesline to shield off their end of the barrack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoffy and Price light a couple of handmade lamps: margarine in tin cans with the wick stuck inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manfredi and Johnson are putting on their leather jackets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry tries to awaken STOSH in the bunk above him. The wooden boards around Stosh's bunk are plastered with Betty Grable cheesecake. Harry pokes him. Stosh does not respond. Harry interlocks his fingers, puts them close to Stosh's ears and cracks them in a SHARP SALVO. Stosh opens his eyes, dazed. Harry pats Stosh's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up, Animal! Betty Grable's on the phone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Stosh gives him a dirty look. Gets out of the bunk. He and Harry move to the little iron stove. Triz is already dismantling the pipe above the stove. Harry and Stosh lift the stove and start inching it to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoffy moving to a large bucket of water. It is a trick job: a bucket within a bucket. He lifts out the shallow inner part with the water. Hidden underneath are some civilian clothes. He takes them out, crosses to Manfredi and Johnson. (All the dialogue in this scene in whispers, of course.)
</DIRECTION>
<HOFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your civilian clothes, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOFFY>
<MANFREDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Hoffy.

Duke takes the clothes from Hoffy and starts stuffing them into a small barrack bag.

</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Sefton, propped up in his bunk, watches the proceedings with a pitying little smile. He eyes wander to Harry and Stosh. By now they have moved the stove some four feet to the side, and start carefully lifting some sawed-off planks out of the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blondie is standing watch by the blanket-covered window, peeking out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price slips a wire hook down into the crack between a bunk and the wall, fishes out a sheaf of papers and walks to Manfredi and Johnson.

	Then once in Friedrichshafen we steal a rowboat, get some fishing tackle, and start drifting across the lake -- always south -- until we hit the other side -- Switzerland.

<DIRECTION>
Sefton has gotten out of his bunk, and is picking up the margarine lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo. Once in Switzerland, just give out with a big yodel so we'll know you're there. It's a breeze, boys.

He lights his cigar butt with the margarine lamp. Manfredi and Johnson shoot him a nervous glance.

<HOFFY>

<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?

Harry and Stosh have by now removed the loose planks off the floor. A small black hole gapes below them.

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready.

<DIRECTION>
Hoffy, Price, Manfredi and Johnson move toward the trap door, Johnson carrying the barrack bag. Hoffy looks at his watch.

He does a take.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll miss you, you cruds.

</JOHNSON>

He turns and climbs down through the trap. Before Manfredi follows him, he turns away, goes down on his knee, crosses himself quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: UNDERNEATH BARRACK 4 - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson has already landed on the ground. Manfredi slips down. They look around and start crawling off in the direction of the latrine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARRACK 4 - (SHOOTING UP THROUGH TRAP)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stosh is peering after them, his head hanging down through the trap from above. Beyond him in the barrack, Hoffy, Price and Duke bend over Stosh, waiting for developments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: UNDERNEATH BARRACK 4 - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Stosh's point of view: Manfredi and Johnson have now reached the end of the barrack and are crawling into the compound towards the wash latrine some fifteen feet away. A searchlight sweeps dangerously towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARRACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stosh pulls up from the trap, his eyes closed, his fingers in his ears. He doesn't want to see or hear the two out there get shot. The others stand petrified. No shots, no screams. So Stosh bends down into the trap again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARRACK 4 - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manfredi and Johnson just manage to fling themselves back under the barrack as the searchlight sweeps past. Then, they get on their feet again and dash to the wash latrine -- just ahead of another searchlight from the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASH LATRINE - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A primitive, roofless structure, with wooden partitions shielding it from the outside. Above, a water tank with pipes running down to spigots over a trough. Under the trough, a wooden lattice to stand on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manfredi and Johnson have reached first base. They stand breathless. Then Manfredi picks up the lattice, leans it against the trough, and lifts a dirt-covered trap leading into the tunnel. Johnson has tied the barrack bag to his own ankle. They HEAR BARKING. Freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HUNDEFUEHRER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leading the mastiffs past the wash latrine. One of the mastiffs is BARKING. He seems to smell something, but the other dogs pull him along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASH LATRINE - (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manfredi and Johnson wait until the BARKING fades in the distance. Johnson, the barrack bag tied to his ankle, jumps down into the narrow vertical shaft. Manfredi follows. He pulls the trap shut over his head in such a way that the lattice falls into place on top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shaft about three feet square and five feet deep leads into a narrow, crudely shored-up tunnel. Johnson and Manfredi light their Zippo lighters and start worming their way through the tunnel, Johnson leading the way, the barrack bag dragging from his ankle.

COOKIE, a chipmunk of a kid, scrambles down from his bunk -- the one above Sefton's. Drags out a footlocker from under Sefton's bunk. The footlocker is chained to the bunk-post. Cookie opens it, starts taking cigarettes out.

Johnson and Manfredi crawling on, by the light of their Zippos. Johnson dragging the bag behind him. They are dripping with perspiration. From above comes a little shower of loose earth.

Johnson stops as he comes to the end of the tunnel. There is another shaft leading up. He picks up a rusty can and starts digging at the earth above.

<DIRECTION>
In the pine forest some thirty feet outside the barbed wire. From the goon towers, the lights sweep over the camp and over the edge of the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tin can thrusts through the ground as Johnson digs into the open. Then, when the opening is wide enough, he climbs out, his face covered with sweat and dirt. He helps Manfredi out. They lie on the ground for a moment, exhausted. Then Johnson starts untieing the bag from his ankle.

<MANFREDI>

	Let's go.

He rises. There is a SHARP BURST of MACHINE GUN FIRE. Manfredi falls instantly. Johnson, not knowing where the gunfire is coming from, tries to turn and run, the bag dragging behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a hillock about thirty feet off a MACHINE GUN, manned by three German guards, is blasting away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light from one of the goon towers picks up Johnson, running. The machine gun gets him, ripping his chest. He spins and crumples to the ground. The light swings to Manfredi. Bleeding, he tries to crawl back to the safety of the tunnel. There is another BURST of FIRE --

INSIDE BARRACK

The men have all run to the window and look out.

All except Sefton and Cookie. They stand at the table where the cigarettes are. And in back of them: Joey, sitting in his bunk, comprehending nothing.

No answer. He nods to Cookie again. Cookie carries the cigarettes to their bunks. Sefton follows him, kicks open the footlocker. Cookie dumps the loot in.

THE CAMP - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another miserable day has begun. The barracks loom in the murky light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the Administration Building -- the one with the swastika -- come a dozen German guards, Lugers hanging from their belts. They spread out and cross the muddy compound toward the barracks, BLOWING WHISTLES shrilly. They lift the wooden bars off the doors and go inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FELDWEBEL SCHULZ has arrived at Barrack 4. He is an enormous man, about fifty-five. His cauliflower ears make a good vegetable for his pig-knuckle face. He removes the bar, opens the door, stands there WHISTLING like a madman, enters.
</DIRECTION>
<COOKIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny thing about those Krauts. They hated the sight of us yet they couldn't wait to look at us again. Every morning -- at six on the dot -- they'd have the Appell -- that's roll call to you. Each barrack had its own alarm clock. Our alarm clock was Johann Sebastian Schulz. I understand the Krauts had a composer way back with the Johann Sebastian in it -- but I can tell you one thing: Schulz was no composer. He was a Schweinehund. Oh, Mother -- was he ever a lousy Schweinehund!

EXT. COMPOUND - COLD GREY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the P.O.W.s are out of their barracks by now. A mass of freezing, disheveled men. Some wear Army coats over their underwear, knitted caps pulled down over their ears. Some are huddled in blankets, their feet in wooden clogs. Only a few are fully dressed and shaven. A few are on crutches or bandaged up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They assemble before their respective barracks, forming a U facing the center of the compound. The barrack chiefs are assisting the guards in lining them up, fifteen abreast and five deep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supervised by Schulz and Hoffy the last ones from Barrack 4 emerge.
</DIRECTION>
<HOFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, men -- fall in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOFFY>
<DIRECTION>
From off comes:
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ach-tung! Abzaehlen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The HUB-BUB dies down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards march down the front line of their barrack groups, counting the lines of five in German.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Schulz passes him, Blondie spots something in the middle of the compound. He nudges Duke. Duke nudges Price, Price Harry, Harry Stosh, Stosh Cookie. Cookie nudges Sefton who is putting on his wool gloves. The glove drops. They all look off in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the compound, right smack in the mud, lie the corpses of Johnson and Manfredi, covered with a blanket. You know it's them because Johnson's foot is sticking out, with the barrack bag still tied to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stir goes through the men of Barrack 4. They are hit hard. All but Sefton. He looks at the corpses for a moment, then bends down, picks up the glove and starts putting it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the Administration Building a German Lieutenant has been supervising a couple of guards as they lay narrow planks over the mud in a line leading to the middle of the compound. He turns now to the P.O.W.s.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parade Atten-tion!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
The German guards come to rigid attention. The Americans just stand there, sullenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lieutenant comes to a heil salute. Through the open door of the Administration Building steps the Kommandant, OBERST VON SCHERBACH, followed by another Lieutenant. Von Scherbach is a big erect officer of the Potsdam School. Over his shoulder hangs a furlined officer's coat. His boots shine like polished glass. He glances over the compound, then walks down the planks, followed by the two Lieutenants, marching through the mud on both sides of him. Von Scherbach stops at the end of the plank. In front of him lies a deep puddle. He clicks his heels and raises his hand in a heil salute.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guten Morgen, Sergeants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
A glowering silence from the men. Von Scherbach lowers his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nasty weather we're having, eh? And I so much hoped that we could give you a white Christmas -- just like the ones you used to know... Aren't those the words that clever little man wrote -- you know the one who stole his name from our capital -- that something-or-other Berlin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
He waits until his nasty little joke sinks in. Schulz has come up to the Lieutenant, salutes and hands him the slips of paper with the prisoner count.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that mud. Come spring -- and I do hope you'll still be with us next spring -- we shall plant some grass here -- and perhaps some daffodils --

He turns to the Lieutenant for the tabulations.

(to the P.O.W.s)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand we are minus two men this morning. I am surprised at you, gentlemen. Here I am trying to be your friend and you do these embarrassing things to me. Don't you know this could get me into hot water with the High Command? They do not like men escaping from Stalag 17 - especially, not enemy airmen from Compound D. We plucked you out of the skies and now we must see to it you do not fly away. Because you would come back and blast our cities again. The High Command would be very angry with me. They would strip me of my rank. They would courtmartial me, after all these years of a perfect record! Now you wouldn't want that to happen to me, would you? Fortunately, those two men --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
From the ranks of the men comes the EERIE DISSONANT SOUNDS of Joey's SWEET POTATO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey, in the second row of the Barrack 4 company, is playing on his ocarina, oblivious to what is going on. Stosh turns and quickly grabs the ocarina from Joey's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Von Scherbach chooses to disregard the little musical interlude.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I was saying: fortunately those two men did not get very far. They had the good sense to rejoin us again, so my record would stand unblemished. Nobody has ever escaped from Stalag 17. Not alive, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps his fingers in the direction of the guard who stands watch over the corpses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard pulls back the blanket in such a manner that all we can see is the barrack bag tied to Johnson's leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P.O.W.s however see the corpses. There is an ANGRY BUZZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoffy marches up to Von Scherbach.

<HOFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOFFY>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<HOFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOFFY>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
Hoffy turns on his heel and walks back to his men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Von Scherbach, without even looking at the corpses, snaps his fingers. The guard throws the blanket back over the bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last time, gentlemen, let me remind you: any prisoners found outside the barracks after lights out will be shot on sight. Furthermore, the iron stove in Barrack 4, the one camouflaging the trap door, will be removed. And so that the men from this barrack will not suffer from the cold, they will keep warm by filling in the escape tunnel. Is that clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
The men just stand there, in frustrated anger. Stosh clenches the ocarina in his first.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, then, gentlemen. We are all friends again. And with Christmas coming on, I have a special treat for you. I'll have you all deloused for the holidays. And I'll have a little tree for every barrack. You will like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
Stosh, with a quick underhand flip, throws the sweet potato in the direction of Von Scherbach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lands smack in the middle of the puddle in front of Von Scherbach and splashes his boots with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
(stiffening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
Absolute silence.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will give the funny man exactly five seconds to step forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
He looks about the compound. Five seconds pass. Nobody moves.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you shall all stand here if it takes all day and all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
From the ranks of the men of Barrack 4, Stosh steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is better!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
But his triumph is short-lived, for almost instantly Harry steps forward alongside Stosh. Then Duke and Blondie and Cookie. Spontaneously, men from all the other barracks follow until all the P.O.W.s have moved forward one step.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see! Six hundred funny men! ...There will be no Christmas trees! But there will be delousing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Schulz)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With ice water from the hoses!

He wheels about and marches back up the plank and into the Administration Building. His Lieutenants after him. Two of the guards start picking up the planks again.

<DIRECTION>
The men break ranks, going off in all directions, some back to the barracks, some toward the latrines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Joey stands where he stood, his eyes fastened on the puddle. Slowly he walks toward it. He bends down and fishes out his sweet potato, dripping with mud. It is broken. He wipes the pieces off on his coat and hides them inside his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASH LATRINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Packed with men from Barrack 4, about two dozen of them. Others waiting outside for their turn. At the trough washing: Hoffy, Price, Duke, Stosh, Harry, Cookie and Sefton. No soap. A couple of worn-out towels. Except for Sefton: He's got soap, towel and tooth brush.

EXT. COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a stampede. P.O.W.s are rushing across the compound toward the Russian compound.
</DIRECTION>

Stosh, charging like a bull, gets tripped and falls flat on his puss right into a mud puddle. Harry zooms past him. Stosh picks himself up and runs after him, his winter underwear dripping with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BARBED WIRE FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dividing the American and Russian compounds. P.O.W.s rush in from all sides, about a hundred of them. They go as far as they are permitted; to a low warning wire, running parallel to the big fence some fifteen feet away. To cross the warning wire is verboten. The German guards up in the goon towers insure that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is great excitement among the P.O.W.s. Some give out with cat-calls and wolf-whistles; others just stand there staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the fence a new batch of Russian prisoners has just been brought in. German guards are counting some sixty prisoners, about twenty of them women. They all are in uniforms and wear boots, a bedraggled lot. The women are big buxom dames, not exactly Golden Circle material, but this is war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Americans jump up and down trying to attract the women's attention. They throw cigarettes, chewing gum, chocolate. One guy is dancing the Kazatski, two of his pals holding him up.

Stosh pours back his tea, a miserable man. His eyes fall on the door. An electric shock goes through him. He grabs Harry's arm. They look off:

Sefton has come into the barrack and is crossing toward the iron stove. In his hand is the incredible -- more beautiful than all the Kohinoors in the world: an egg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Stosh stand there with their eyes bulging. They start forward, drawn by the egg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cookie is at the stove, tending a can of boiling water. He sees Sefton and puts a makeshift skillet (the banged-up top of a tin can) with a dab of margarine in it, on the fire. Sefton takes some keys out of his pocket, tosses them to Cookie.

He flips the egg over in the skillet. Harry and Stosh cover their eyes and yelp in panic. To their relief they see that the egg has landed safely. The aroma of the frying egg has brought about six P.O.W.s down from their bunks. They crowd around, their mouths watering.

Cookie, at Sefton's bunk, has taken from one of the footlockers three cans, a china cup with a broken handle, a fork, a spoon, and a salt-and-pepper shaker. He slams the locker shut with his foot and sets everything up on the other footlocker. Hoffy, Duke and Price, seated at the table eating chow, eye him with disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the stove comes Sefton carrying the skillet and the can of boiling water. The other P.O.W.s, including Harry and Stosh, follow him, hypnotized by the egg. Sefton walks to his bunk, sits down on a little stool, puts salt and pepper on the egg. Cookie meanwhile has opened the cans. From one of them he measures out a spoonful of instant coffee into the cup and pours the boiling water over it. Sefton takes two lumps of sugar out of the other can and some Zwieback from the third can. The guys around him sniff the royal breakfast. The situation is tense.

Well, I'm no escape artist! You can be the heroes, the boys with the fruit salad on your chest. Me -- I'm staying put. And I'm going to make myself as comfortable as I can.

Quickly Harry flips the ball over the net at him. The guard slaps it back across the net. Again Harry pops it at him ... and slowly the guard finds himself sucked into the game.

Schulz reacts to what he has seen. he watches the last of the P.O.W.s leave, and the Germans carry the stove out of the barrack. He closes the door. His entire attitude has changed. He is serious and efficient. He walks over to the chess set on the table. Out of his pocket he takes a chess piece -- a black queen -- and exchanges it with the black queen from the set. He puts it in his pocket. Steps over to the light bulb, pulls the slip knot free and exits.

	The killer-diller, of course -- the real bonanza -- was when Sefton put up the Observatory. He scrounged himself some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror and got Ronnie Bigelow from Barrack 2 to put the whole shebang together for a pound of coffee. On a clear day you could have seen the Swiss Alps, only who wanted to see the Swiss Alps? It was about a mile away, that Russian delousing shack, but we were right on top of it. It cost you a cigarette or a half bar of chocolate a peek.

Harry and Stosh are doing dandy as they paint up the highway. Harry gets his bearings: the delousing shack is some twenty- five feet off the road. He paints a very elegant turn off the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GATE BETWEEN THE COMPOUNDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The German guard is stamping up and down. Suddenly he does a double take as he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUSSIAN COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white line leading down the middle of the highway veers off idiotically over the terrain towards the shack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GERMAN GUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there perplexed, then takes off after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DELOUSING SHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Stosh have now painted up to the window of the shack. Without even stopping, they paint right up the wall and around the window. As they paint, they peer in through the thick steam (through which we cannot distinguish anything). Now, they paint down the building on the other side of the window and toward the doorway. Into their pathway come the boots of the German guard. They paint right over the boots. Then they see the butt of the guard's rifle. They look at each other. They are in trouble. They stop painting and straighten up slowly.

Harry gives the guard's eye-glasses a couple of quick strokes of paint. Dropping paint and brush, Stosh and he run like mad back toward the gate.

The guard stands there struggling with his glasses.

The Russian women, huddled in blankets, giggle their heads off.

INT. BARRACK 4 - (DAY)

About twenty P.O.W.s lazing about. The sack rats in their bunks. Triz and Price playing chess, Joey looking on blankly. Sefton, a towel around his neck, is sitting in a chair being shaved by Cookie. Stosh, in his bunk, is carving a new ocarina for Joey out of wood. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY to:

The electric light bulb, hanging straight and innocent on its wire.

<COOKIE_S_VOICE>

The whole barrack springs to life, everyone moving towards Marko with whistles, screams and hoorays. Joey, who keeps staring at the chess board. Sefton and Cookie go on with the shave.
</DIRECTION>
<MARKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ease! At ease! First, the Kommandant is sending every barrack a little Christmas present. A copy of Mein Kampf.

</MARKO>
<DIRECTION>
He has knelt down in front of The Crutch and pulls out from the empty pant's leg a little Christmas tree.

<MARKO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Law school?! You don't want to be a stinking lawyer with a stinking brief case in a stinking office, do you, Joey?

Joey just sits there. Stosh goes on reading.

He shoves the letter into Joey's pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<STOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next time we write to your folks, Joey, you know what you're going to say? You're going to say you don't want to be a lawyer any more. You want to be a musician -- like play the flute, maybe -- eh, Joey?

EXT. BARRACK 4 - (DAY)

<DIRECTION>
Hoffy is walking across the muddy compound towards the barrack, leading a couple of new prisoners: LIEUTENANT DUNBAR and SERGEANT BAGRADIAN. They are exhausted but, by contrast to the old P.O.W.s, remarkably clean. They are followed by a P.O.W., carrying two barrack bags.

On the muddy compound there is a tag football game going on with some forty G.I.s watching.

Sefton is walking along. Behind him, Duke has come out of the barrack and is following him. Sefton becomes aware of it. Nonchalantly, he walks into a wash latrine.

Sefton comes in. There is another P.O.W. there, a colored guy, just finishing washing his hands. Sefton quickly climbs up a couple of rungs of the ladder leading to the water tank and stops there. The colored P.O.W. doesn't notice it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a funny thing about Sefton and me. I guess I knew him as well as anybody else in the camp because I had worked for him for two years. But there were lots of things I didn't know about him. Take for instance, where he would disappear to once in a while. Of course, I had a hunch, but it seemed so crazy I couldn't quite believe it -- Just as I would never have believed that Sefton was the guy that would give away Lieutenant Dunbar for blowing up that ammunition train.

Duke is still following the wrong guy. Now the P.O.W. stops to talk to a pal. Duke realizes his mistake. He dashes back into the wash latrine and comes out again. He stands there frustrated. With the football players rushing about, passes being thrown and G.I.s milling around, he has lost Sefton.

Von Scherbach enters, followed by his aide. All the P.O.W.s look on tensely.

<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Sergeants.

<DIRECTION>
(looking around)

He holds out his hand. His aide hands him a slip of paper.

<VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he salutes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay here. Why bother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
	</DIALOGUE>

(to his aide, sharply)

The aide takes Dunbar by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HOFFY>

(to the aide)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. We have some rights here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to von Scherbach)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is this man being taken out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOFFY>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(on second thought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not get them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SCHERBACH>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps his fingers. The aide marches Dunbar out. Von Scherbach follows, slamming the door after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, there is a stunned silence. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<BAGRADIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAGRADIAN>
<HOFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOFFY>
<BAGRADIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAGRADIAN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<BAGRADIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAGRADIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The men stand struck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then all eyes go to Sefton. He is closing his footlockers. He senses their look. Straightens up.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at me for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. He shoves the footlockers under his bunk. From OFF come whistles and shouts: 'Lights Out!'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go out. The barrack is in semi-darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose some jerk's going to say I did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
He crawls into his bunk. He lies there, his eyes wide open. The air is charged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long moment, the men move in on him, led by Duke and Stosh. Sefton sits up to meet them. A couple of guys grab him from behind, hold him down.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you try it one at a time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
The first blows are falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joey lies in his bunk, his head propped against the bedpost, his face still in idiotic Hitler make-up. He does not comprehend the SOUNDS from Sefton's bunk, the beating and muffled cries. In the foreground, the electric bulb, hanging straight, sways gently.

EXT. COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wintry day. Cold sun shining. Through the big gate two vehicles are driving into the compound: a 1939 Buick sedan and a tarpaulin-covered truck. The vehicles are muddy, battered, and carry the insignia of the Red Cross. They stop in front of the Administration Building. P.O.W.s converge from all sides. Out of the Buick steps the Geneva Man: a friendly type, about fifty-five, dressed in civilian clothes and carrying a brief case. He tips his Homburg to the P.O.W.s, but they are more interested in the truck. While a couple of German lieutenants exchange credentials with the Geneva Man, the Red Cross drivers roll back the tarpaulin of the truck, and the P.O.W.s (including all the men from Barrack 4, except Sefton) crowd around the goodies.
</DIRECTION>
<COOKIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, there's a lot of folks around these days that don't believe in Santa Claus. I always did and I always will. For a while there, I thought the German Luftwaffe had shot him down, reindeer, sleigh and all. But, no sir! Come the day before Christmas, he showed up with some presents for us, the Geneva Man did. He had started out with seven truckloads. He was lucky to get one of them through -- with all the bombing and booby traps and pilfering. Still, they were presents and made you feel good: coffee, a little sugar and some candy and toothbrushes and about a thousand rolls of that sanitary paper. Brother, they sure kept sending us reams of that stuff. I'll bet you if they had dropped all that paper on Berlin the first day, the war would have been over right then and there.

INT. BARRACK 4 - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is quite changed now. The wash is gone. Everything is put away. The barrack is apparently empty, except for a German guard and Schulz, who gives the place a last once-over. The German guard is sweeping dust under the bunks.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schnell! Schnell! Bevor der Mann vom Roten Kreuz inspizieren kommt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<DIRECTION>
At one of the bunks he sees a miserable plant, potted in a smelly old shoe. He picks it up and gives it to the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nehmen Sie das hinaus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<DIRECTION>
The guard takes the shoe out. Schulz, about to leave himself, sees a pair of socks hanging from the line above. He rips them down and tucks them disgustedly under a blanket. From OFF comes:
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Schulz!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Schulz turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the other end of the barrack, Sefton is lying in his bunk. He has propped himself up on his elbow. His face is battered. One eye is swollen, one ear gashed. His body is aching.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
<DIRECTION>
(crossing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? You must get out of the bunk. The Geneva Man is coming to inspect the barrack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Sefton's condition.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
(holding out a pair of silk stockings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breaking off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silk stockings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Take them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the stockings upon Schulz.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
He has dragged himself out of his bunk and is taking cartons of cigarettes out of the footlocker.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the guy, Schulz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?

</SEFTON>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not want those cigarettes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>

He pulls himself up with an armful of cartons.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make it five hundred!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<DIRECTION>
Sefton grabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk what? I do not know anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many do you want? A thousand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
He bends over the footlocker, fighting his pain, comes up with more cartons. He thrusts them upon Schulz.
</DIRECTION>
<SEFTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it! Take it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
There is a SOUND of P.O.W.s entering. Schulz looks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P.O.W.s are coming back from the compound with the Christmas presents. Hoffy, Price, Duke, Harry and Stosh stand in the door, looking at Sefton and Schulz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schulz quickly drops the cartons on Sefton's bunk. Stands embarrassed for a moment, then retrieves his poise.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen! When the Geneva Man comes through the barrack, I don't want any funny business. No mustaches. We will all behave ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHULTZ>
<DIRECTION>
He goes toward the other end of the barrack, which is by now filled with all the other P.O.W.s. Schulz stops.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHULTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And gentlemen! You will not complain to the Geneva Man. Because I have orders from the Kommandant to report everyone who complains.

INT. VON SCHERBACH'S OFFICE - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The office is in the Administration Building. It is primitive, sparsely furnished. A desk with a couple of phones on it. Iron stove. A black leather sofa. Maps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room are von Scherbach, Dunbar and the Colonel's ORDERLY. The Colonel's boots, shining gloriously, stand near the desk. He is pacing up and down in his stocking feet talking to Dunbar. In his hand is the black queen from the chess game. He tosses it into the air once in a while and catches it. Dunbar stands close to a wall. He is completely exhausted, fighting sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
START the SCENE on the chess piece in von Scherbach's hand and PAN with it as von Scherbach walks to reveal the room.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.

	Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?

</DIRECTION>
<VON_SCHERBACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you appreciate this moment, Lieutenant. You see, I am a cavalry man. All the von Scherbachs were cavalry men. Well, you know what happened to the cavalry. The young ones they put into panzer divisions. The older ones they put in the quartermaster's corps. Or they made them recruiting officers or wardens. Like me. Wet nurses to putrid prisoners. In Berlin they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists. They will remember now!

<VON_SCHERBACH>

The Geneva Man looks straight into von Scherbach's eyes. Von Scherbach doesn't like the look. He picks up the black queen and tosses it again.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sefton is lying in his bunk, dressed. Cookie above him in his bunk. At the center table, Harry, Stosh, Blondie and Bagradian are decorating the Christmas tree with their dogtags and hand-made candles. Joey sits there watching them. Blondie takes off Joey's dogtags and puts them on the tree. One of the P.O.W.s is WHISTLING Silent Night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on a stool is Triz. He is knitting a little baby's garment. He pauses as a thought disturbs him, then:

	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIZ>
<DIRECTION>
He goes on with the knitting.

Through the door come Duke and Price, followed by two P.O.W.s from another barrack. One P.O.W. is carrying an old-fashioned phonograph, the other some records.

</SEFTON>
<DIRECTION>
At the table, Price finishes cranking the machine. Harry puts on a record and Price starts it playing. The tune is: When Johnny Comes Marching Home. The guys start crowding around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Stosh has been watching the P.O.W.s from Barrack One take down the distillery. As they start out, he grabs up an empty glass jar, follows them surreptitiously and, in moving, siphons off a stream of booze into the glass jar. One of the P.O.W.s catches him.
</DIRECTION>
<P_O_W>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! That goes with it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</P_O_W>
<DIRECTION>
They pull the hose out of the glass jar and leave. Stosh, however, has gotten himself a pint of Schnapps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the table Harry and a few others start singing with the record. Everybody has gathered around except Sefton and Cookie. Price moves over to his bunk, (PAN with him). As he takes off his jacket his eyes fall on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The loop in the electric cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price. His eyes narrow for a split second. Then he takes his cap off, cases the situation. The P.O.W.s are at the phonograph. Sefton lies in his bunk, his eyes toward the wall. Cookie climbs down to join the others. Nonchalantly, Price crosses toward the lamp. He stands at the table with his back towards the barrack. Picks up the black queen, pulls the top off, palms a small piece of paper, puts the top back and places the chess piece back on the chess board. He is about to read, but -- Some of the P.O.W.s come marching down the barrack toward Price in a take-off of a homecoming parade, led by Harry and Stosh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price stands there, the note in his fist. After they have passed, he opens his hand, reads the palmed note, puts it in his pocket. He looks after the others who are now marching down at the other end of the barrack. Casually, he pulls the slip noose out of the light cord, and walks toward the center table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sefton, lying in his bunk, sees the shadow of the bulb and the light cord on the wall, swinging gently back and forth. It doesn't make too much of an impression on him. However, he definitely notices it and looks around for the cause. He dismisses it and lies back in his bunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Johnny Comes Marching Home number is over and Bagradian now goes into an impersonation of Lionel Barrymore, as the mayor of a small town, welcoming home the returning warriors -- and Jimmy Stewart answering for the soldiers. (To be worked out later). During this, Price has joined them.

INT. BARRACK 4 - (EVENING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are on. In the foreground, our bulb, with a loop in the cord again. A Christmas party is in progress. On the center table, the pitiful little tree is lit. All the P.O.W.s in the barrack are huddled around the table, most of them sitting on the bunks. They are singing Adeste Fideles. It is bitter cold. Outside the wind is howling. They are wrapped in blankets and most of them wear gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As for Sefton, he is lying in his bunk, a pariah. Duke comes over from the group, pulls Sefton's foot-locker out and starts taking out the bottles of Rhine wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the corkscrew?

<DUKE>

<DIRECTION>
He takes a cigar, puts it in his mouth and goes off with the wine. As Sefton looks after him, his eyes are caught by the light cord and the noose in it. He stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P.O.W.s around the tree are SINGING, Price prominently in the foreground. Duke has come with the wine and starts opening it. Stosh nudges Joey who sits next to him and points to a lone little package under the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<STOSH>

The phonograph, on the center table, is playing: I Love You. About a dozen P.O.W.s are dancing with each other, among them, Triz, leading Harry, Blondie, leading a bearded P.O.W. The whole thing is very elegant, with new guys cutting in, politely. One of the P.O.W.s sings into a mike, consisting of a stick stuck into a knothole in the table with a tin can on top.

<COOKIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it got to be Christmas Day in Stalag 17. As it turned out, it was more like the Fourth of July -- with all the fireworks that were to go off all at once and bust the camp wide open. It sure started off innocently enough, with a party going on in every barracks...

Sefton, propped up in his bunk, is watching the proceedings. In back of him, against the window, sits Cookie. Sefton's eyes never leave --

Price, who is near the phonograph with Pirelli and another P.O.W. They are supplying a makeshift jazz accompaniment, playing on a washboard, drumming on the table and strumming a bass fiddle string attached to a bucket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sefton. There is a look of cynical amusement on his face as he takes this in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A P.O.W. tags Triz to cut in. Harry holds out his arms. He is ready. But the P.O.W. dances off with Triz, leaving Harry flat. Harry looks over to Stosh.

Stosh lies in his bunk, drinking what's left of the booze he swiped from the distillery. He is staring at the pin-ups of Grable pasted on the ceiling of his bunk.

	I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?

Harry sitting on the table, listening to the music. He is in the identical pose Betty Grable has struck in the big pin-up photo.

Stosh's eyes go back to the big pin-up photo. He looks back at:

Harry. By now it is not Harry who is sitting there. It is Betty Grable, or rather the pin-up photo superimposed in the same size as Harry.

EXT. COMPOUND - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several hundred P.O.W.s are casually strolling about the compound. The CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the Administration Building PAST an S.S. car parked on the roadway, with the motor running. An S.S. driver stands at the car door. Harry and Stosh stand by the car, inspecting it. CAMERA MOVES ON PAST the flagpole, against which leans Duke, and ON TO the porch of the Administration Building: there stands Hoffy, reading the bulletin board. Only he isn't reading it. From one corner of his eye he is peeking through the window into the Kommandant's office. Suddenly he reacts to a movement inside. Without turning, he gives the signal: he throws one end of his muffler around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duke, at the flagpole, gets it and throws his muffler around his neck, thusly relaying the signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the car, Harry follows suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marko, leaning against the north latrine, catches the signal and, still facing the compound, RAPS with his knuckles on the wooden boards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTH LATRINE - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crutch is sitting on the wash trough. On hearing the RAPS, Bagradian pulls up The Crutch's loose pants' leg. Blondie strikes a match and lights the fuse on the smudge pot. Bagradian pulls down the pants' leg. They help The Crutch off the wash trough and he hobbles out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crutch is slowly hobbling toward the car, a thin wisp of smoke curling up from his pants' leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the Administration Building emerge two S.S. Men, leading Dunbar between them. Hoffy, standing at the bulletin board, WHISTLES a few bars of the Air Force song. Dunbar turns, sees Hoffy whistling. Hoffy doesn't look at him, but Dunbar senses that something is in the wind. He walks on between the S.S. Men. As he is being led toward the car, still some thirty feet away, P.O.W.s crowd in to watch him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crutch, hobbling on from the direction of the latrine, is some twenty feet from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duke straightens up from the flagpole casually, and starts sauntering toward the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The latrine. Blondie and Bagradian have moved out of the latrine and stand there with Marko, watching the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Stosh at the car. Stosh tightening the belt of his coat, Harry pulling the barracks cap tight on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver of the car opens the door. The S.S. Men and Dunbar are some eight feet away now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crutch, hobbling past the car, releases a string and the smudge pot drops as he moves on. He barely makes it. Almost instantly, there is a belch of fire and smoke starts pouring out of the smoke bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind billows the smoke across the car, rapidly enveloping the S.S. Men and Dunbar. There are German SHOUTS from within the smoke cloud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duke, Harry, Stosh, Blondie, Bagradian, Marko and Hoffy move into the smoke from all sides. All now is lost in smoke. Just silhouettes of men rushing about. SHOUTS, German commands, SOUNDS of scuffling. From OFF a siren starts to sound. German guards come running from all corners of the compound into the cloud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the goon towers, the guards wheel around their machine guns, but don't dare to shoot into the smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the Administration Building storms von Scherbach, followed by the two Lieutenants, Schulz and other guards. They dash into the smoke cloud, which starts lifting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMPOUND - THROUGH THE WINDOW OF BARRACKS 4
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smoke cloud starts to clear. At the car, the two S.S. Men and the driver stand with guns in their hands. Dunbar is gone. The other P.O.W.s stand around innocently. Von Scherbach is screaming his head off, but his words are not heard. CAMERA PULLS BACK INTO Barracks 4, revealing Sefton and Price at the window. Sefton turns from the window, a little smile on his face.

EXT. COMPOUND - (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the P.O.W.s are formed into a line that serpentines toward a desk set up on the porch of the Administration Building. Light machine guns have been set up around them, the guards watching carefully. Behind the desk sit the two German Lieutenants, and in back of them stands Schulz. Every P.O.W., as he passes, is screened by the Lieutenants, then dogtags and faces being checked against an index of cards and photographs on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<COOKIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Where did we hide him? Nobody knew that except Hoffy -- not one of us -- and he wouldn't talk. It sure drove the Krauts crazy looking for Dunbar. They herded us all out into the compound and put some extra machine guns on us and gave us the old picture check. You know, checking our dogtags and our pans...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOKIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Pirelli, Blondie, Hoffy and Duke file by. The next in line is Price, followed by Sefton. As Price is being checked, his eyes meet Schulz's. Schulz looks at him inquisitively. The only answer on Price's face for a split second is: "I don't know". But he's got to watch himself as he is followed by Sefton.
</DIRECTION>

A barracks: Guards with dogs are searching under it.

Another barracks: German guards throw tear gas bombs into it and close the doors.

The compound. All the P.O.W.s are now lined up in long lines facing the Administration Building. Von Scherbach, standing on the porch flanked by the S.S. Men, his Lieutenants and Schulz, lets go with a tirade. THE CAMERA SWOOPS BACK from his face over the lined-up P.O.W.s all the way to the south latrine and UP AND OVER the water tank. As it now PANS INTO the water tank, we see Dunbar. He is hiding in the water tank, up to his knees in icy water. He is weak and drawn and he has to hold on not to collapse.
</DIRECTION>
<COOKIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...against their index file. They searched under the barracks. They searched the roofs. They even searched the bathroom in the Kommandant's office, but no Dunbar. Then they tried to smoke him out, throwing tear gas bombs into every barracks, just in case he was hiding up in the rafters. Then they made us stand for six hours out there until finally von Scherbach came out and gave us his ultimatum: if Dunbar didn't come out by next morning he'd raze the whole lous; compound, stick by stick and if we'd sleep in the mud for the rest of our lives, that was okay by him. I thought he'd bust his gut the way he was screaming. He just couldn't figure how a guy could disappear from the compound and still be there, but Dunbar was there all right. He sure was there.

Price. A machine gun bullet has struck him in the shoulder. He desperately tries to evade the relentless light beams. He manages to tear off the tin cans, runs on towards the Administration Building.
