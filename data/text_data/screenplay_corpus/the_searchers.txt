The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints

EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON

We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man than Ethan and possibly a few years older.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, followed by Ben, toward where

EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND AARON - LATE AFTERNOON

Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.

<AARON>

</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Aaron...

His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him.

Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse toward their side.

He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious.

<DIRECTION>
Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.

Martin stops again.

<ETHAN>

He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it as though it contained something of value. Martin watches with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him.

Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn't care what Martin thinks, nor does he explain. Martin leads the horse off.

INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite, but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace -- in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre Ethan has brought home from the wars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father's right and Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is watching Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

</ETHAN>

The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm gong. Eight fast clangs.

Ethan doesn't like being called Uncle -- as we must know from the quick look he shoots at Martin. But he acknowledges it.

<ETHAN>

Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.

<BEN>

He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something -- and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored satin ribbon.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>

She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha takes it and reacts at its weight.

</MARTHA>
<ETHAN>

Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand.

He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- lights it at the fire.

<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you stayed out beyond all need to... WHY?

Ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it.

Martha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack, reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink.

Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' twice that in here.

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...only these got the late Emperor Maximilian's picture on 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a different interest.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He glances questioningly at Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut yourself?

She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of sadness and hopelessness is in the look.

Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.

She turns obediently and follows Aaron. Ethan looks after them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door. Martha goes into it and Aaron follows and closes the door.

Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out.

Debbie's dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly ride toward the house and dismount. A lamp goes on inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SIX HORSEMEN ARE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN, THE REVEREND SAM CLAYTON, a big man with frosty blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air of grave and resolute authority. He is a minister of the Gospel with a .44 on his hip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable, impulsive. He is in his early twenties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him "tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a time and in a region where few men lived to see their grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties; resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.

During the swearing-in, Ethan will enter the room from the inner door -- unnoticed by the other men, but not by Martha.

EXT. THE EDWARDS' HOUSE -- DAWN LIGHT

As Ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight of a couple -- Brad and Lucy -- in each other's arms, standing near the saddled horses of the posse. Clayton and Jorgensen following him out, spot the couple, who now belatedly are conscious of their audience.

He swings her up in front of his saddle. They start away.

Ethan is last to ride out. He is watching Martha. He brings a gloved hand up in a salute. She starts to raise her hand but only brings it just above her waist, a fluttering gesture with tremulous fingers. It is the last he will ever see of her alive.

Ethan and Mose are advancing at a steady walk, both men leaning slightly out of their saddles to study the terrain -- the trail they are following. Out to one side -- fifty yards distant -- is the main body of the posse: Sam, Jorgensen, Charlie, Ed, moving roughly parallel to Ethan but at a faster clip. Martin comes riding in toward Ethan from behind CAMERA.

Jorgensen doesn't even seem to hear him. Angrily Ethan whips out revolver and fires into the air. Then he swings his arm in a come-back gesture. He rides out ahead then a short distance and dismounts... and slowly the others follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun. Ethan goes to the nearest one. A feathered lance is driven into it. He pulls the lance out. Mose comes over beside him.

	Caddo or Kiowa, huh?... Ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that!

<JORGENSEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama!... Oh please... please no... BRAD!

And with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow and they take off... fast. Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry follow. Sam Clayton pauses.

Debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll.

The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes. Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway, absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn't made a sound and is sure he's got away with it.

This should be an expansive view to convey the fact that the posse has split -- the main group heading for the Jorgensen place, Martin forking off to race alone for the Edwards ranch.

Coming toward and passing CAMERA is Martin, riding all out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several hundred yards away and moving in a divergent direction are the others -- Brad and Charlie, Sam, Jorgensen and Ed Nesby. The men are not compactly bunched, but strung out, each taking his own best course and his own speed... As the riders pass and the dust of their passing, we see two other riders -- Ethan and Mose -- minute specks in the distance, possibly a mile or two behind.

Ethan and Mose are holding their mounts to a jog, in marked contrast to the all-out pace of the others. The CAMERA PANS after them as the dark fingers of the night stretch across the valley. The wind begins to rise and somewhere off in the hills a coyote pack yaps.

Nothing stirs and we hear nothing. Then, with faintest little rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals something glittering -- like beads.

Useless. Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard -- struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face is alive with hope. He gets the rifle free at last and goes running toward the oncoming riders.

The ANGLE is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan as they ride in. Little tongues of fire are licking the edges of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning is on the faces of the men as they dismount.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through the house:

The shawl Debbie had worn. It is spread out, almost as though concealing a body. Fearfully he stoops and pulls it away...

There is nothing there, but the shawl. He drops to his knees, his head bowed, his face tortured. The moonlight is clear on the face of the nearer headboard. It is of weathered wood and the chiselled letters on it read:

<DIRECTION>
Fog and heavy morning mist rise from the swamp. Some cattails in the near ground. The effect is eerie, very still except for the trilling of frogs. Then, very quietly, the men emerge from the mist swirling around them. They are leading their horses. Sam looks baffled, angry. They stand still, listening -- then slowly continue.

EXT. FLAT GROUND - ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL SHOT - DAWN MIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mist is thinning. In the f.g. is a small blackened area -- the ashes of a campfire. The men come through the mist -- wary, vigilant. It is Mose who first spots the fire. He runs to it and drops beside and feels the ashes.

The mist is thinning as the men warily move along.

Suddenly there is the faint hoot of an owl from behind and to one side... the men turn slightly, hearing it... A moment later another owl hoot, from the same side but up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the interchange of looks, we must know that the riders are aware of its significance. Mose cups hand to his mouth and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls. Clayton glares at him.

EXT. NEAR RIVER - PANNING SHOT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS from a sun-touched butte or crag to the file of men slowly walking their horses. An occasional shred of mist drifts by. Everything about the little cavalcade bespeaks tension, watchfulness. Suddenly -- and every man sees it at the same time -- we see a file of eight Comanches ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel with, but slightly converging on, our group.

EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - PAST THE SEARCHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing the gap.

Clayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the Rangers reach the bank. They rein in, wheel their horses and are reaching for the rifles as the Comanche vanguard races into view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting their horses, rifles at their shoulders.

The charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison -- and the Indians wheel to shelter.

Swinging simultaneously from their saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off.

He bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his grief. Martin turns away from him and walks back to Ethan.

EXT. ROUGH ROLLING COUNTRY - NIGHT - MOVING - CLOSE SHOT - BRAD

He comes pounding down a slope, and he takes off his hat and skims it away. He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve the rush of raging blood.

92-B

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE EDGE OF A RISE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BRAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the crest and reins in. A distant firelight is on his face. He takes one moment to look down into the Comanche camp o.s. Then he has his gun out. His eyes are wild, his face wet with sweat. Then he throws back his head and he yells -- and with the yell goes charging into the camp.

They rein in -- staring -- as from afar they hear Brad's yell echoing and bouncing off the canyon walls. There is nothing they can do. They hear his shouts, then the quick bark of his .44, and the angry shouts of the Comanche.

EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - CLOSE SHOT - SCAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched. He releases it at his running target. We hear its impact and a high gasp of pain... and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other Comanches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
92-F
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A RIDGE - FULL ON MARTIN AND ETHAN AS BEFORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The distant yammering of the Comanches doesn't quite drown out one stifled scream of pain; we can surmise a scalping knife was busy in the last instance of Brad's life. Martin slumps in his saddle. Ethan listens a moment, then turns to Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>

A study of horseprints etched in the soil -- the mark of the passage of many horses; perhaps an eagle or turkey feather fallen from a warbonnet. And then we hear and see the approach of two plodding horses, and the dusty boots of the horsemen -- Ethan and Martin -- following the trail. The Search Theme resumes and continues over the next three shots, helping us suggest the passage of time, the change of scene.

TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The time is spring. It is a year and a half later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars Jorgensen comes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their appearance and full of unspoken questions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her. Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as Ethan and Martin dismount.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception. They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen.

<DIRECTION>
MARTIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and described in the book as the "grandmother room": with narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly a fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door. It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... What you doin'...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During this:

INT. THE KEEPING ROOM OF THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots; the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the good plain Swedish modern of today.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told, a cheerful, warm-smelling room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait, listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get her mother's attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near the mantel.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>

Maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come...

The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't heard a word of it.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>

	By golly, the letter... In the chest, mama... It came for you, Ethan... last winter...

Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought it...

</JORGENSEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two- inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and looks at the snip of cloth.

He holds out the snip of calico.

She is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails the floor.

Mrs. Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with head pressed against the door. She wants to offer some word of sympathy, but doesn't know what to say. She crosses to the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee. Then we hear the drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away. Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him back.

Low, squat adobe structure, with a crudely lettered sign- board proclaiming it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
'JEREM. FUTTERMAN, TRADER'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are adjacent outbuildings and corral. Four horses are tied outside, two being pack animals. A surly-looking white man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door, whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses covetously. He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back.
</DIRECTION>

Fearfully she quickens her step. The man gets up, shoves knife into belt and heads into the post.

INT. FUTTERMAN'S TRADING POST - FULL SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables and benches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room, examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress -- Debbie's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin nods soberly in answer to Ethan's inquiring look; yes, it's hers. Both look up as FUTTERMAN crosses from the bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his fingers thrust inside the glasses. Futterman is a squaw man and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face.
</DIRECTION>
<FUTTERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FUTTERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. Martin snatches it out of his hand.

Martin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a pillow. Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry wood on the fire, making it blaze up.

He spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll, and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to suggest it is over the figure of a man. During this:

Martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. Ethan nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn't going to change positions. Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them to complete the dummy. He picks up his rifle then and quietly walks out of the camp.

At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks... and one man is knocked flat on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman, dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now.

She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a Comanche -- her father. Martin, with an armful of trade goods -- a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances shyly at her father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father points to Martin's pile of trade goods. Martin bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger: wait! Then she runs back through the other Comanches now crowding forward.

INT. THE CHAPEL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING TO DOOR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into the room -- then stops in manifest shock. Martin
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in the room -- almost an animal sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHAPEL - REVERSE SHOT - FULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures -- at least two being the bodies of children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be no more than in her mid-thirties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light hair.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie?... DEBBIE?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but do not turn.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be scared, ma'am...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at them with frightened eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KEEFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't pay any attention to her...

Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder.

<MARTIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand, like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pabo-taibo!

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other girl laughs. Martin turns away and he's sick.
</DIRECTION>
<KEEFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was your niece about their age?

Martin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan and Keefer move away. As they do, the madwoman -- eyes fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never see the dead. During this:
</DIRECTION>
<KEEFER>
<DIRECTION>
(the dispassionate pro)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to see them all... It might help us identify them... Shot in the head -- flash-burn range... The boy got his skull cracked... Here's the girl...

</KEEFER>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stiffens, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't take it. Ethan returns.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar... And where we begin to look, I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KEEFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff... trade goods... Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican... Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border... What do they call themselves?

Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead ashes of his pipe. Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a corner of her apron.

She looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys Laurie. Laurie resumes her letter reading:

That's all there is. Not a cross on it. Laurie just looks at it. Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick in his back. He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and replaces them on the mantel.

Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic, hard look about them both. The music theme segues into something livelier and Mexican as we -

EXT. A MEXICAN VILLAGE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the street. Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without a saddle -- only a blanket pad. There is something familiar about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in.

as Ethan and Martin enter. It is a dirt-floored room with a small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls. A pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. A couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic- looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper cigarette; she is barefoot. Behind the bar is the proprietor, dozing on his stool. Ethan takes a step into the room.

The proprietor awakens. The domino game is suspended in mid- play. Estrella turns... and from beside Emilio, previously obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the head of old Mose. Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers.

<MOSE>

	Ay-eh...?

He is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens and closes in words that won't come out. He grabs and shakes Ethan's arm, then Martin's.

She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored amusement.

Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar -- gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand. Meanwhile, dance and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily. Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded, and he sees what is going on.

At the head of the column ride Ethan, Emilio, and Martin. Behind them come Emilio's cargadores -- lean, hard-bitten wiry little Mexicans. One leads a handsome palomino.

It is a leading question and Scar knows it. He looks long at Ethan and the suggestion of a smile touches his lips.

<DIRECTION>
But he makes no direct answer. He looks instead to Emilio.

Emilio quickly turns and calls to one of his men. Emilio is worried.

	Co-bay tabitz-chat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning) (Very fine horse.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scar looks at it greedily, then nods. He'll accept it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Ethan. Again that faintly contemptuous smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He signals them to enter his tepee.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Martin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay out here.

</ETHAN>
<MARTIN>

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He follows Ethan into the tepee... and a worried Emilio goes along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEPEE - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft of sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two chunky squaws, who have been tending the fire or grinding corn in a rock pestle, scuttle to a side of the tepee. Two others, one half-grown and the other slightly taller, sit with their backs to the fire, huddled over some leather work or stitching. Both are shawled. As Scar enters, he barks a word to the squaws near the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pie-kay!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Clear out!) (then he turns to the white men)
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
He sits on some robes, signs for them to sit opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly they look around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEPEE - REVERSE ANGLE - AS FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT - TTE TWO OLDER SQUAWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are sitting with heads averted, slightly profiled -- but clearly Indian women, broad-faced, dark of hair and skin.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
One of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it is another Indian face. The other does not turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scar leans in, blocking the view.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two sons -- killed by white men... For each son, I take many scalps...

(in Comanche)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mayah-kay zee-eh!...

<DIRECTION>
(Bring the lance!)
</DIRECTION>

The slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn't move. Scar glares.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MAYAH-KAY ZEE-EH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAR>
<DIRECTION>
The girl gets to her feet. Ethan and Martin watch as, still with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from the tepee wall. It has several scalps on it, including one with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them, so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists. Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEPEE - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard:
</DIRECTION>
<SCAR>
<DIRECTION>
(in Comanche)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pie-kay!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Go!)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes back to her former place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin's eyes are wide and his breathing seems suspended. But Ethan is playing it like a poker player.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(his voice controlled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen scalps before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Scar's eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from his shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide string. Scar touches it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAR>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan smiles -- and he's still playing poker. He stands... and the others follow. Scar is puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to trade, not to admire his collection... Tell him we're going to pitch camp across the crick... Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow.

Scar hasn't understood all of it. He scowls and looks at Emilio.

</DIRECTION>
<SCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Puetze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCAR>
<DIRECTION>
Martin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can't help but pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - THE THREE MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not fast, not slow, and without a side glance. Scar emerges and looks after them -- glowering. A few other Comanches begin to gather near his tepee.

A mounted Comanche is on the crest of the dune above them -- rifle raised. Martin's first shot brings him down the dune in a spectacular horse-and-man fall. Debbie goes running like a deer up the creek, away from Martin; in the same instant we hear the angry yells of distant Comanches charging from the far left. Martin turns to see Debbie running away.

Clayton -- and the other Rangers -- have been hanging gunbelts on pegs along the wall. Now he shakes out his parcel -- disclosing a green-black frock coat.

EXT. JORGENSEN HOME - FULL SHOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horses, wagons fill the yard. We can hear the lively music of the square dance. As Jorgensen opens the door and sets out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and on it are Martin and Ethan. Jorgensen at first doesn't recognize them.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGENSEN>
<DIRECTION>
(hailing them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi!... You're late... hurry...

as he enters, with Jorgensen at his heels. For a moment, as he stands there, the party breezes on. Then first one, then another sees him. They gape, and the music falters and stops. Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the room. Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes a very bad job of it.
</DIRECTION>
<JORGENSEN>

Mrs. Jorgensen throws herself against his chest, sobbing.

Ethan looks past her at Clayton. And the faces of both men are grim.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GRANDMOTHER ROOM - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark. Martin is pacing, eyes constantly turning to the inside door. And then it opens and Laurie is inside, holding a lamp. She is in her bridal gown and very obviously trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Martie....
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
He just stares at her -- very lovely, strangely remote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I wrote you a letter... Reckon you didn't get it...

</MARTIN>
<LAURIE>

<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't much of a letter...

</MARTIN>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it wasn't... You mighta said you loved me... You mighta asked me to wait... At least that'd have been something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I allus loved you... You know that, without my sayin' it... I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait... the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...

She sinks onto the bench.

<LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and you know it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to cry, very softly. He is beside her and his arm goes around her shoulder comfortingly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry, Laurie... I understand how it is... I'll just go 'way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<LAURIE>

(spinning on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do and I'll die, Martie... I will! I'll just die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
And they are kissing through her tears when the outer door is flung open by Charlie MacCorry. They part as he glares.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll thank you to leave the room, Laurie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin stares at him, then at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie MacCorry!... You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She sure is!... An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AND other things... Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took... I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter. He side- steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the wall. Laurie runs between them.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! Both of you... I won't have any fighting in this house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin gently brushes her aside.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right... Charlie, let's move outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't wearing no gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt. The men head outside as Laurie runs to get help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - BREEZEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now at a run.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant MacCorry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into Clayton's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(regaining his balance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sir... pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case, give the boys room...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat. He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is a wrestler against a boxer.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fight fair, son... Use your fists!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(drily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend... Let 'em alone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling -- now trying to imitate Martin's crouch. Suddenly Martin feints a right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the order of business. Charlie staggers and Martin follows up with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under other circumstances -- be neatly and expeditiously scalped. With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife. He looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could scalp him... but I'll just count coup!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to grab a lock of Charlie's hair and neatly snip it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet -- easing the tortured arms. Clayton goes to Charlie's side. Laurie moves to Martin's side.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right, sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunno... Seems so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie frowns and looks off at where Laurie and Martin are standing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't goin' to be any weddin' -- not till we get a few things cleared up 'round here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks rather unsteadily away leaving a thunderstruck assembly, murmurous with surprise.

WIPE TO:

<DIRECTION>
The last of the wedding guests is leaving: Ed Nesby carrying his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller children preceding him out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jorgensens stand by -- trying to put a good face on the wedding debacle. Charlie MacCorry is sitting dejectedly, studying a spot on the floor. Ethan is at the mantel. Laurie is in her room -- presumably changing out of her wedding gown. Martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip. Clayton, still in his clerical coat, is near the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NESBY>

He leads her away. Clayton faces Ethan.

	This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain... Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman... Probably needed killin'... I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend... Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.

Ethan casually reaches into his pocket, takes out a gold coin and spins it.

Clayton stands in the opened doorway, Jorgensen behind him, looking out. Drawn up outside is the four-man cavalry detail, led by a young and very crisp LIEUTENANT. We may or may not see the sixth man, slouched over his horse. The Lieutenant swings off and crosses.

	<DIALOGUE>
	JOINT action?

	What information?

</ETHAN>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That maybe he's not far from here -- holed up somewhere, waiting his chance to get back over the border... He raided north about a month ago... ran into more army than he bargained for... Now he's running for cover, for keeps this time...

FULL SHOT - THE FILE OF RANGERS - DAWN LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass CAMERA one by one -- Sam Clayton in the lead, Martin behind him leading two horses, then the others -- grim- looking, capable men of varying ages; some with long drooping mustaches, some in need of shaves, some chawing tobacco.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is lying prone, his hat off, squinting down into a long reach of desert canyon at the Comanche encampment -- with tepees set up, a thin wisp of smoke rising from a fire, the horse herd penned in a draw cut off by an improvised corral of rawhide ropes.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE COMANCHE ENCAMPMENT - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - DAWN LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camp is sleeping. A dog yaps shrilly. One of the tepee flaps opens and Scar steps out. He picks up a stone or a chunk of wood and throws it. The dog yelps and runs off. Scar's air is troubled, suspicious. He heads for the horse herd. The camp sleeps on.

CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT

Martin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp, dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HORSE HERD - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SCAR

He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines. In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill, insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs.

Scar isn't satisfied but returns to his work.

EXT. THE COMANCHE CAMP - ANGLE FAVORING SCAR'S TEPEE PAST MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around him and begins walking to the tepee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LEE OF THE HOGBACK OR RISE - FULL SHOT - THE RANGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along the line of men, then mounts his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The State of Texas is payin' you boys $12 a month. Here's your chance to earn it... Now I don't want any foolin' around after scalps. We ain't got the time...

INT. SCAR'S TEPEE

INT. TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE

She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair. Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin quickly claps a hand over his mouth.
</DIRECTION>

Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie... don't!

And then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other squaws wake -- begin squawking.

INT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER P.O.V. - SCAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps in, Martin's gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet, catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the awakening of the camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs his hat and bows his head.

<CLAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For these Thy gifts which we are about to receive...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(donning his hat, he turns to the bugler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre at the "charge."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding, the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their teeth, guns in their fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in. The bark of hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have never been up against such marksmen. One charging Ranger rides down a tepee. Another, with two guns drawn, scores a running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite sides of his fast-running horse. A dodging Comanche screams as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him sprawling into the embers of the campfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche crouched near the tepee. The charge races past him. Ethan swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and glares. A squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised, but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep. He turns and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes, seeing what he has been looking for:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - LONG SHOT - ETHAN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along, while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers, regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the Comanche horse herd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND DEBBIE

Martin hears Ethan's horse riding down at them; he turns, and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>

	No, Ethan! NO!

</MARTIN>

He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - DEBBIE AND ETHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust. Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - ETHAN AND DEBBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his gun. The hammer goes back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...

The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's. We HOLD for a long moment and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks over to her.
</DIRECTION>

He looks down at her.

The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse, each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge: sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop.

EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - FAVORING CLAYTON
</DIRECTION>

It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling, applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump. Beyond them some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.

Charlie just gapes, but Clayton -- grim-lipped -- bends a meaningful glare on someone off. Greenhill looks that way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - LT. GREENHILL

He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.

EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding Debbie's hand. And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.

He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing the distant horsemen. He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, then with dawning realization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect... and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE

The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the still unseen but nearing horsemen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie looks then at Martin. He doesn't know whether to smile or not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.
