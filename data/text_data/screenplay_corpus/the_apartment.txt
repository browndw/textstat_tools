Acres of gray steel desk, gray steel filing cabinets, and steel-gray faces under indirect light. One wall is lined with glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel.

INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house in the early 1900's has been chopped up into living room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. The wallpaper is faded, the carpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture could stand shampooing. There are lots of books, a record player, stacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24 payments), unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art (Picasso, Braque, Klee) tacked up on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record is spinning around on the phonograph. On the coffee table in front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, a pitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle of vodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the bottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigar stubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts, and a woman's handbag.

Bud is pacing back and forth, throwing an occasional glance at the lit windows of his apartment. A middle-aged woman with a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk.

She is MRS. LIEBERMAN, the dog is a Scottie, and they are both wearing raincoats. Seeing them, Bud leans casually against the stoop.

Bud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on a small table, looks around with distaste at the mess his visitors have left behind. He sniffs the stale air, crosses to the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide. Now he takes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains of the cocktail party from the coffee table. Loaded down with glasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potato chips, he starts toward the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>

The doorbell rings. Bud stops, undecided what to do with the stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door, barely manages to get it open. Mr. Kirkeby barges in past him.

He carries his load into the kitchen.

<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is minute and cluttered. On the drainboard are an empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar with one olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the old-fashioned refrigerator. He takes out a frozen chicken dinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard. He rinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini pitcher into the sink, thinks better of it. He pours the contents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar, scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an imaginary companion, and drinks up. Then he pulls a wastebasket from under the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the empty vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar. Picking up the heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room toward the hall door.

The door of Bud's apartment opens, and Bud comes out with the wastebasket full of empty bottles. Just then, DR. DAVID DREYFUSS, whose wife we met earlier, comes trudging up the stairs.

INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens the oven, turns off the gas. He takes a coke out of the refrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from a drawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls the hot aluminum tray out of the oven. He carries everything out into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the living room, Bud sets his dinner down on the coffee table, settles himself on the couch. He rears up as something stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out a hairpin. He drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner. Without even looking, he reaches over to the end table and presses the remote TV station-selector. He takes a sip from the coke bottle, his eyes on the TV screen across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The picture on the TV set jells quickly. Against a background of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announcer is making his spiel.

	But first, a word from our sponsor. If you smoke the modern way, don't be fooled by phony filter claims --

Bud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station- selector, pushes the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new channel pops on. It features a Western -- Cockamamie Indians are attacking a stagecoach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's not for Bud. He switches to another station. In a frontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the furniture and each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud wearily changes channels. But he can't get away from Westerns -- on this station, the U.S. Cavalry is riding to the rescue. Will they get there in time?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud doesn't wait to find out. He switches channels again, and is back where he started.

On the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front of the crisscrossing searchlights.

<DIRECTION>
That does it. Bud turns the set off in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TV screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of light in the center, which gradually fades away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his teeth. From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on stretchers. Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf, shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of water. He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the night table is on. Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns the dial on. Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow behind him. From the night table, he picks up the magazine that arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper, opens it. It's the new issue of PLAYBOY. Bud leafs through it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine. He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it, then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion section. There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE WILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back. Illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow his mind starts wandering. He turns back to the overleaf again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject. By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he yawns. He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light, settles down to sleep. The room is dark except for the glow from the dial of the electric blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three seconds. Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living room. Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his slippers, makes his way into the living room. He switches on the light, picks up the phone.

INT. PHONE BOOTH IN A MANHATTAN BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the night is a hearty man of about forty-five, nothing gut personality, most of it obnoxious. His name is DOBISCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the booth is a blonde babe, slightly boozed, and beyond there is a suggestion of the packed, smoky joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya, Buddy-boy. I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay, Buddy-boy. Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances toward blonde)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- she's a skater with the Ice Show --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PHONE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice. Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
BUD - ON PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.

(pulling rank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
BUD - ON PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
The blonde opens the door of the phone booth, leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting lonely. Who are you talking to, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet. That's real sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
Dobisch shuts the door in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it thirty minutes. What do you say, Bud?

INT. THE APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone; resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, shuffles back into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch -- no trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch -- be my guest --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He reappears from the bedroom, pulling his trousers on over his pajama pants.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We never close at Buddy-boy's -- looks like Marilyn Monroe --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he chuckles a la Dobisch)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting on his raincoat and hat, Bud opens the hall door, takes the key from the table, shoves it under the doormat. His eyes fall on the Dreyfuss apartment, and there is some concern on his face. He picks up a pad and pencil from the table, prints something in block letters. Tearing off the top sheet, he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph, then walks out, closing the door behind him. The note reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOT TOO LOUD, THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud comes out the door, in slippered feet, pants and raincoat over his pajamas. As he sleep-walks down the steps, a cab pulls up in front of the house. Bud ducks discreetly into the areaway. Mr. Dobisch, bareheaded, emerges cautiously from the cab. Between the fingers of his hands he is carrying four long-stemmed glasses, brimful of stingers. The blonde steps out, holding his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This the place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to cab driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<CABBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy cents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, turns to the blonde, indicates his pants pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the money, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
The blonde plants the hat on top of his head, unbuttons his overcoat, reaches into his pants pocket. As she does so, she jogs his elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch those stingers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
The blonde has taken out Dobisch's money clip, with about a hundred dollars in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him a buck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
The blonde peels a bill off, hands it to the cabbie, hangs on to the rest of the roll just a second too long.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now put it back, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she does)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atta girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
The cab drives off. Dobisch and the blonde start up the steps to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure this is a good idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't think of a better one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding door open for him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
(edging past her with stingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
In the areaway, Bud has overheard them, and it doesn't make him any happier. He steps out on the sidewalk, shuffles down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blonde and Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, come up to Bud's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the key, will you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
Automatically, she reaches into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not there. Under the mat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under the mat?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up key)
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
(impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open up, open up -- we haven't got all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
The blonde unlocks the door to the apartment, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
(suspiciously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is your mother's apartment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Maria Ouspenskaya.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BLONDE>
<DIRECTION>
(sticking her head in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
Dobisch nudges her inside with his knee, kicks the door shut behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landing is empty for a second. Then the door of the rear apartment opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss, in a beaten bathrobe, sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them. Suddenly, from Bud's apartment, comes a shrill female giggle. Dr. Dreyfuss reacts. Then the cha cha music starts full blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
(calling to his wife, off-screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mildred -- he's at it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking his head, he closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud, in raincoat and slippered feet, turns in off the street, plods along a path in the deserted park. He stops at a damp bench under a lamp post, sits. In the background, lights shine from the towering buildings on Central Park South.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud huddles inside his raincoat, shivering. He is very sleepy by now. His eyes close and his head droops. A gust of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench. Bud doesn't stir. He is all in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a quarter to nine of a gray November morning, and work- bound employees are piling in through the doors. Among them is Bud, bundled up in a raincoat, hat, heavy muffler and wool gloves, and carrying a box of Kleenex. He coughs, pulls out a tissue, wipes his dripping nose. He has a bad cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lobby is an imposing, marbled affair, as befits a company which last year wrote 9.3 billion dollars worth of insurance. There are sixteen elevators, eight of them marked LOCAL - FLOORS 1-18, and opposite them eight marked EXPRESS - FLOORS 18-37. The starter, a uniformed Valkyrie wielding a clicker, is directing the flow of traffic into the various elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators. Also standing there is Mr. Kirkeby, reading the Herald- Tribune.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(hoarsely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<KIRKEBY>
<DIRECTION>
(as if he just knew him vaguely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. They are indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sniffs)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors open, revealing the operator. She is in her middle twenties and her name is FRAN KUBELIK. Maybe it's the way she's put together, maybe it's her face, or maybe it's just the uniform -- in any case, there is something very appealing about her. She is also an individualist -- she wears a carnation in her lapel, which is strictly against regulations. As the elevator loads, she greets the passengers cheerfully.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(rattling it off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Mr. Kessel -- Morning, Miss Robinson -- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby -- Morning, Mr. Williams -- Morning, Miss Livingston -- Morning, Mr. McKellway -- Morning, Mr. Pirelli -- Morning, Mrs. Schubert --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
Interspersed is an occasional "Morning, Miss Kubelik" from the passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Mr. Baxter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Miss Kubelik.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his hat off -- he is the only one. The express is now loaded.
</DIRECTION>
<STARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(working the clicker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all. Take it away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STARTER>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shutting the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the door, please. Blasting off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is standing right next to Fran as the packed express shoots up.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(studying her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do to your hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sort of like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He sniffs, takes out a Kleenex, wipes his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, you got a lulu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I better not get too close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I never catch colds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes me feel just terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dabs his nose)
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have stayed in bed this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have stayed in bed last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator has slowed down, now stops. Fran opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nineteen. Watch your step.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
About a third of the passengers get out, including Bud and Mr. Kirkeby. As Kirkeby passes Fran, he slaps her behind with his folded newspaper. Fran jumps slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(all in the day's work)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And watch your hand, Mr. Kirkeby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<KIRKEBY>
<DIRECTION>
(innocently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of these days I'm going to shut those doors on you and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
She withdraws her hand into the sleeve of her uniform, and waves the "amputated" arm at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
The doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirkeby turns away from the elevator, and grinning smugly, falls in beside Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRKEBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Kubelik -- boy! Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. She's the best operator in the building.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<KIRKEBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<KIRKEBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice. What is she trying to prove?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<KIRKEBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to him. Little Lord Fauntleroy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<DIRECTION>
Leaving Bud at the employees' coat-racks, Kirkeby heads toward his office, one of the glass-enclosed cubicles. Bud hangs up his hat and raincoat, stows away the gloves and muffler. Out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti- histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops, and still carrying the Kleenex, threads his way to his desk. Most of the desks are already occupied, and the others are filling rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once seated at his desk, Bud arranges his medicaments neatly in front of him. He takes a Kleenex out of the box, blows his nose, then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays first one nostril, then the other. Suddenly the piercing bell goes off -- the workday has begun. Being the ultra-conscientious type, Bud instantly sits upright in his chair, removes the cover from his computing machine, picks up a batch of perforated premium cards, starts entering figures on his computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few seconds, he glances around to make sure that everybody in the vicinity is busy. Then he looks up a number in the company telephone directory, dials furtively.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(cupping hand over phone mouthpiece)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mr. Dobisch? This is Baxter, on the nineteenth floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOBISCH'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a glass-enclosed cubicle on the twenty-first floor. Through the glass we see another enormous layout of desks, everybody working away. Dobisch is holding the phone in one hand, running an electric shaver over his face with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shuts off electric shaver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
BUD - ON PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DOBISCH>
<DIRECTION>
BUD - ON PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.

</DIRECTION>
<DOBISCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leafs through report on desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.

<DIRECTION>
BUD - ON PHONE
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, feels his forehead. It is warm. Clipped to his handkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and, next to it, a thermometer in a black case. Bud unclips the thermometer case, unscrews the cap, shakes the thermometer out, puts it under his tongue. He resumes work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<MESSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Mr. Dobisch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MESSENGER>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(thermometer in mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away from the messenger, unties the string of the envelope, takes his key out, puts it in a coat pocket. From a trouser pocket, he extracts Dobisch's key to the executive washroom, slips it discreetly into the envelope, reties it, hands it to the messenger.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(thermometer in mouth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Mr. Dobisch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Puzzled by the whole procedure, the messenger leaves. Bud now removes the thermometer from his mouth, reads it. It's worse than he thought. He puts the thermometer back in the case, clips it to his pocket, takes his desk calendar out of a drawer, turns a leaf. Under the date WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4 there is an entry in his handwriting -- MR. VANDERHOF. Bud consults the telephone directory again, picks up the phone, dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VANDERHOF'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is another glass-enclosed cubicle on another floor. MR. VANDERHOF, a Junior Chamber of Commerce type, is dictating to an elderly secretary who sits across the desk from him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Mr. MacIntosh --

Bud snake-hips between the desks like a broken-field runner.

At the elevator, Bud presses the UP button, paces nervously. One of the elevator doors opens, and as Bud starts inside, the doors of the adjoining elevator open, and Fran Kubelik sticks her head out.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing her voice, Bud throws a quick "Excuse me" to the other operator, exits quickly and steps into Fran's elevator.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-seven, please. And drive carefully. You're carrying precious cargo -- I mean, manpower-wise.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

</BUD>
<FRAN>

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --

INT. TWENTY-SEVENTH FLOOR FOYER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
It is pretty plush up here -- soft carpeting and tall mahogany doors leading to the executive offices. The elevator door is open, and Bud steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope everything goes all right.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so.

	Fine.

(stepping out of elevator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.

</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the carnation out of her lapel, starts to put it in Bud's buttonhole.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. That's the first thing I ever noticed about you -- when you were still on the local elevator -- you always wore a flower --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator buzzer is now sounding insistently. Fran steps back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck. And wipe your nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
She shuts the doors. Bud looks after her, then takes a Kleenex out of his pocket, and wiping his nose, crosses to a glass door marked J. D. SHELDRAKE, DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL. He stashes the used Kleenex away in another pocket, enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a sedate office with a secretary and a couple of typists. The secretary's name is MISS OLSEN. She is in her thirties, flaxen- haired, handsome, wears harlequin glasses, and has an incisive manner. Bud comes up to her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C. C. Baxter -- Ordinary Premium Accounting -- Mr. Sheldrake called me.

She indicates the door leading to the inner office. Bud squares his shoulders and starts in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Sheldrake is a $14,000 a year man, and rates a four- window office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is not quite an executive suite, but it is several pegs above the glass cubicles of the middle echelon. There is lots of leather, and a large desk behind which sits MR. SHELDRAKE. He is a substantial looking, authoritative man in his middle forties, a pillar of his suburban community, a blood donor and a family man. The latter is attested to by a framed photograph showing two boys, aged 8 and 10, in military school uniforms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Baxter comes through the door, Sheldrake is leafing through Dobisch's efficiency report. He looks up at Bud through a pair of heavy-rimmed reading glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baxter?

</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchair facing Sheldrake.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Dobisch said that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(modestly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very flattering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldrake puts the report down, takes off his glasses, leans across the desk toward Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud does so. For a moment, he is a picture of intense concentration. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind repeating the question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(in a very small voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?

</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(rises, starts pacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.

</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

	There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(a deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
	</DIALOGUE>

He whips out the nasal-spray, administers a couple of quick squirts up each nostril.

	Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --

In his vehemence he squeezes the spray bottle, which squirts all over the desk.

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is your apartment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>

	How do you work it with the key?

	Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --

	That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now put down the key --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing a pad toward him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and put down the address.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud lays the key on the desk, unclips what he thinks is his fountain pen, uncaps it, starts writing on the pad.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on the second floor - my name is not on the door -- it just says 2A --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he realizes that he has been trying to write the address with the thermometer.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Baxter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He has replaced the thermometer with the fountain pen, and is scribbling the address.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be careful with the record player, won't you? And about the liquor -- I ordered some this morning -- but I'm not sure when they'll deliver it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He has finished writing the address, shoves the pad over to Sheldrake.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how people talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you don't have to worry --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I have anything to hide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding out the tickets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>

Clutching the tickets, he backs out of the office.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is about 6:30, and the building has pretty well emptied out by now. Bud, in raincoat and hat, is leaning against one of the marble pillars beyond the elevators. His raincoat is unbuttoned, and Fran's carnation is still in his lapel. He is looking off expectantly toward a door marked EMPLOYEES' LOUNGE - WOMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the female employees are emerging, dressed for the street. Among them are Sylvia and her colleague from the switchboard.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I figure, a man in his position, he's going to take me to 21 and El Morocco -- instead, he takes me to Hamburg Heaven and some schnook's apartment --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SYLVIA>
<DIRECTION>
They pass Bud without paying any attention to him. Bud has heard the crack, and looks after Sylvia, a little hurt. Then he glances back toward the door of the lounge, as it opens and Fran Kubelik comes out. She is wearing a wool coat over a street dress, no hat.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(passing Bud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.

</FRAN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She is about three paces beyond him when he suddenly realizes who it is.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- Miss Kubelik.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he rushes after her, taking off his hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.

</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean -- like a girl-friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Like a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
She proceeds across the lobby toward the street entrance, Bud following her.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell 'em -- now and then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>

He follows her out through the revolving doors.

<DIRECTION>
Fran and Bud come out.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(putting his hat on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(stops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time does the show go on?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight-thirty.

</BUD>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at her watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bud nods happily, falls in beside her as she starts down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is your cold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(high as a kite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(does a little cha cha step)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a sudden thought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know where I live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
They have now reached the corner, and Fran stops.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning the corner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight-thirty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her walk away, an idiot grin on his face. Despite what he told Fran, his nose is stuffed up, so he takes out the anti-histamine and sprays his nostrils. Then, carried away, he squirts some of the stuff on the carnation in his buttonhole, moves off in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fran comes hurrying along the street. She is late. Her objective is a small Chinese restaurant, with a neon sign reading THE RICKSHAW - COCKTAILS - CANTONESE FOOD. She starts down a flight of steps leading to the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bar is a long, narrow, dimly-lit room with booths along one side. Beyond a bamboo curtain is the main dining room, which does not concern us. The place is decorated in Early Beachcomber style rattan, fish-nets, conch-shells, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The help is Chinese. At this early hour, there are only half a dozen customers in the place -- all at the bar except for one man, sitting in the last booth with his back toward camera. At a piano, a Chinese member of Local 808 is improvising mood music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fran comes through the door, and without looking around, heads straight for the last booth. The bartender nods to her -- they know her there. As she passes the piano player, he gives her a big smile, segues into JEALOUS LOVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fran comes up to the man sitting in the last booth.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(a wistful smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldrake, for that's who it is, looks around nervously to make sure no one has heard her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Fran -- not so loud.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gets up)
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still afraid somebody may see us together?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me take that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

<DIRECTION>
(sits opposite him, with her coat on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have a frozen daiquiri?

</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on the way.

<DIRECTION>
(sits down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you went ahead and cut your hair.

</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I liked it better long.

</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
A waiter comes up with a tray: two daiquiris, fried shrimp, eggrolls, and a bowl of sauce.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>

(showing all his teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evening, lady. Nice see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>

	Thank you.

The waiter has set everything on the table, leaves.

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long has it been -- a month?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six weeks. But who's counting?

</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed you, Fran.

	You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>

(avoiding his eyes)

	Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.

</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she is barely able to control herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't make these shrimp like they used to.

</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(not listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears in her eyes. She breaks off, downs what's left of the daiquiri.

	How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?

Sheldrake slips a bill to the piano player, who gives them a big smile, slides into JEALOUS LOVER again. Retrieving his hat and coat from the checkroom girl, Sheldrake steers Fran through the door.

It's 9 o'clock, the lobby is deserted, and standing on the sidewalk all by himself, is Bud. He takes a Kleenex out of his pocket, blows his nose, stuffs the used Kleenex in another pocket. He looks up and down the street, consults his watch, decides to wait just a little longer.

BAXTER'S DESK CALENDAR

The leaves are flipping over. Mr. Sheldrake seems to be using The Apartment regularly -- for the name Sheldrake, in Bud's handwriting, appears on the pages dated Monday, November 9, Thursday, November 12, Thursday, November 19, Monday, November 23, and Monday, November 30. Mr. Sheldrake also seems to be Baxter's only customer by now, since the other leaves of the calendar are blank.

INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a gloomy December morning, and hundreds of desk-bound employees are bent over their paper-work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud Baxter, in raincoat and hat, is clearing out his desk. He has piled everything on his blotter pad -- reference books, papers, a fountain pen set, pencils, paper clips and the calendar. Watching him from the next desk is a dumbfounded Moffett. Bud picks up the blotter pad with his stuff on it, and as he moves past Moffett's desk, Moffett takes out a dollar bill, drops it grudgingly on the loaded pad. Bud flashes him a little grin, continues between the desks toward the row of glass-enclosed offices housing the supervisory personnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes up to an unoccupied cubicle. A sign painter is brushing in some new lettering on the glass door -- it reads C. C. BAXTER, Second Administrative Assistant. Bud studies the sign with a good deal of satisfaction.

With an "Oh, " the painter opens the door for him.

INT. BAXTER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud enters his new office, deposits his stuff on the bare desk, looks around possessively. The small cubicle boasts one window, carpeting on the floor, a filing cabinet, a couple of synthetic-leather chairs, and a clothes-tree -- to Bud, it is the Taj Mahal. He crosses to the clothes-tree, removes his hat and coat, hangs them up. From OFF comes --

	Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me --

She scoots out the door. The other girls immediately abandon their posts, and dash after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a swinging party, all right. Nobody is working. Several desks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top of this improvised stage four female employees and Mr. Dobisch, with his pants-legs rolled up, are doing a Rockette kick routine to the tune of JINGLE BELLS. Employees are ringed around the performers, some drinking out of paper cups, others singing and clapping in rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and it is jammed with people. Mr. Kirkeby and Mr. Vanderhof are pouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his hands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water- cooler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in -- everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle, holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze. Since his promotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel, and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round collar, and a foulard tie. He also has quite a glow on. Detouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction of the elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors of Fran's elevator are just opening, and the switchboard operators, led by Sylvia, come streaming out.
</DIRECTION>
<SYLVIA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so I said to him: Never again! -- either get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl --

As they head for the party, they pass Bud, who is approaching the elevator with the two drinks. Fran is just closing the elevator doors.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Kubelik.

The doors slide open again, and Fran looks out. Instead of the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform, she wears a sprig of holly.

	Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --

<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't.

</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.

	Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

Bud ushers Fran in, and is confronted by a strange couple necking in the corner. He gestures them out, crosses to his desk.

From under the desk he has produced a hatbox, and out of the hatbox a black bowler, which he now puts on his head.

	He and I are like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses his fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sent me a Christmas card. See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He has picked up a Christmas card from his desk, shows it to Fran. It is a photograph of the Sheldrake clan grouped around an elaborate Christmas tree -- Mr. and Mrs. Sheldrake, the two boys in military school uniforms, and a big French poodle. Underneath it says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEASON'S GREETINGS from the SHELDRAKES. Emily, Jeff, Tommy, Jeff Jr., and Figaro.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(studying the card ruefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Makes a cute picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(touching the brim of his bowler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket, opens it, hands it to Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(examining himself in the mirror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
His voice trails off. There is something familiar about the cracked mirror of the compact -- and the fleur-de-lis pattern on the case confirms his suspicion. Fran notices the peculiar expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(with difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mirror -- it's broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
The phone has started to ring. Bud doesn't hear it. He closes the compact, hands it to Fran.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up phone from desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(throws a quick look at Fran)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(covers mouthpiece; to Fran)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Have a nice Christmas.

She exits, closing the door. Bud takes his hand off the mouthpiece.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(every word hurts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Sheldrake -- no, I didn't forget -- the tree is up and the Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator -- yes, sir -- same to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, stands there for a moment, the bowler still on his head, the noise from the party washing over him. He slowly crosses to the clothes-tree. picks up his coat -- a new, black chesterfield. With the coat over his arm, he starts out of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party has picked up tempo. On top of the desks, Sylvia is doing a mock strip tease -- without taking any clothes off. There is hollering, drinking and clapping all around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud moves past the floor show, paying no attention. Kirkeby spots him, detaches himself from the cheering section around Sylvia.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRKEBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you going, Buddy-boy? The party's just starting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching up with him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, kid -- give me a break, will you -- how about tomorrow afternoon? I can't take her to that drive-in again -- the car doesn't even have a heater four o'clock -- okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRKEBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bud ignores him, continues walking through the ranks of empty desks.

DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is six o'clock, and the joint is crowded with customers having one for the road before joining their families for Christmas Eve. There are men with gaily wrapped packages, small trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in a plastic bag. Written across the mirror behind the bar, in glittering white letters, is HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Everybody is in high spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody except Bud Baxter. He is standing at the bar in his chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, brooding over an almost empty martini glass. The bartender comes up, sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick, takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in front of Bud. Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half a dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on the counter. He is obviously trying to complete the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from the street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTA_CLAUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to bartender)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Charlie -- give me a shot of bourbon -- and step on it -- my sleigh is double parked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTA_CLAUS>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs uproariously at his own joke, nudges Bud with his elbow. Bud stares at him coldly, turns back to his martini. The laughter dies in Santa Claus' throat. He gets his short of bourbon, moves down the bar to find more convivial company.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her middle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat. Her name is MARGIE MacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw, and she too is alone. From a distance, she is studying Bud with interest. On the bar in front of her is a container of straws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tears off the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending the wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passes right in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margie, undaunted, lets go with another missile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. No reaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's cheek. He never takes his eye off his martini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her empty glass, comes up alongside Bud. Without a word, she reaches up and removes the wrapper from Bud's bowler.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You buy me a drink, I'll buy you some music.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sets the glass down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rum Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Not waiting for an answer, she heads for the juke box. Bud looks after her noncommittally, then turns to the bartender.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rum Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating martini glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And another one of these little mothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
At the juke box, Margie has dropped a coin in and made her selection. The music starts -- ADESTE FIDELIS. She rejoins Bud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their drinks in front of them. Bud removes the new olive, adds it to the pattern on the counter in front of him. They both drink, staring straight ahead. For quite a while, there is complete silence between them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of nowhere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like Castro?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a blank look from Bud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean -- how do you feel about Castro?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is Castro?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is Mickey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you can't win 'em all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
They sit there silently for a moment, contemplating the injustices of the world.

	No.

<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.

	I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.

INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is dark, except for a shaft of light from the kitchen, and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small Christmas tree in front of the phony fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hunched up in one corner of the couch is Fran, still in her coat and gloves, crying softly. Pacing up and down is Sheldrake. His coat and hat are on a chair, as are several Christmas packages. On the coffee table are an unopened bottle of Scotch, a couple of untouched glasses, and a bowl of melting ice.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops and faces Fran)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a new approach)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he resumes pacing; Fran continues crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops in front of her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(through tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.

</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Fran --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbing her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a flat, wrapped package.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He strips away the wrapping to reveal a long-playing record. The cover reads: RICKSHAW BOY - Jimmy Lee Kiang with Orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he has taken out a
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	money clip, detaches
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
a bill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the money out, but she doesn't move. Sheldrake slips the bill into her open bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have some nice alligator bags at Bergdorf's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves. Sheldrake looks at her, then glances nervously at his wrist watch.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fran, it's a quarter to seven -- and I mustn't miss the train -- if we hadn't wasted all that time -- I have to get home and trim the tree --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Fran has started to remove her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs the coat back on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought as long as it was paid for --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(an angry step toward her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing her arms)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop that, Fran.

<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll miss your train, Jeff.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat, gathers up his packages.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You run along -- I want to fix my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(heading for the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(that stops him in the half-open door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't always be like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(coming back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Fran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHELDRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the packages to one side, he tries to kiss her on the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
(turning her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful -- lipstick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment, closing the door. Fran stands there for a while, blinking back tears, then takes the long-playing record out of its envelope, crosses to the phonograph. She puts the record on, starts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER. As it plays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, her body wracked by sobs. Finally she regains control of herself, and picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroom toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag on the sink, turns on the faucet. Scooping up some water, she washes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off, picks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices in the pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a vial of pills on the medicine shelf. Fran reaches out for the vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. The label reads: SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fran studies the label for a second, then returns the vial to the shelf. She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick. As she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrake left in the bag. Her eyes wander back to the vial on the medicine shelf. Then very deliberately she picks up Bud's mouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turns on the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.

The joint is deserted now except for the Santa Claus, who is leaning against the bar, quite loaded, and Bud and Margie MacDougall, who are dancing to a slow blues coming from the juke box.

</BARTENDER>

Bud and Margie ignore him, continue dancing -- or rather swaying limply cheek-to-cheek. The bartender crosses to the juke box, pulls the plug out. The music stops, but not Bud and Margie -- they continue dancing.

<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O-U-T -- out!

	<DIALOGUE>

<MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(shuddering deliciously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you, lover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her, disappears into the kitchen. As Bud starts to remove his coat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the phonograph. He crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuck in the last groove of a long-playing record.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then puts it aside and substitutes the cha cha record. As the music starts, he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door, hangs up his chesterfield and bowler. He turns back into the room, still dancing, suddenly spots Fran's gloves on the coffee table. He picks up the gloves, looks around for some convenient place to get rid of them. Moving over to the bedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bed inside. He shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in a delayed reaction to something he saw inside. He quickly opens the door again, looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is Fran. The light from the bathroom falls across her. She is fully dressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him, walks over to Fran.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up. It's past checking-out time, and the hotel management would appreciate it if you would get the hell out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Fran doesn't stir)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like you -- I used to like you a lot -- but it's all over between us -- so beat it -- O-U-T -- out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no reaction; he puts
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	a hand on her
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
shoulder, shakes her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on -- wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't respond. But something falls out of her hand, rolls across the bed. Bud picks it up, looks at it -- it is his sleeping-pill vial, now uncapped and empty.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(a hoarse whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
For a second he is paralyzed. Then he drops the vial, grabs Fran, lifts her into a sitting position on the bed, shakes her violently.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Kubelik! Miss Kubelik!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Fran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's. Bud lets go of her, rushes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away. Bud dashes to the phone, picks it up. Then it occurs to him that he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up. Out of the kitchen comes Margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I broke a nail trying to get the ice-tray out. You ought to buy yourself a new refrigerator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud, not listening, runs past her to the hall door and out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean right now.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud arrives at the door of the Dreyfuss apartment, starts ringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Dreyfuss! Hey, Doc!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss stands there sleepily, pulling on his beaten bathrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(words tumbling over each other)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get my bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Bud turns and runs back into his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margie has settled herself comfortably on the couch, and is fixing the drinks. The cha cha music is still going. Bud comes flying in, heads for the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- over here, lover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud stops in his tracks, suddenly aware of her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's all this running around? You're going to wear yourself out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud strides over to her purposefully, yanks her up to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so rough, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(taking the glass out of her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.

<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night?

(thrusting the fur coat at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The party's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>
(easing her toward door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Dreyfuss comes hurrying in, carrying his medical bag. He stops, bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a wide-awake girl in the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this one --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the bedroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- in there, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, what's going on here, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(propelling her toward the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just clear out, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud reaches under the coffee table, where she left her shoes, retrieves them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some lover you are. Some sexpot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud shoves the shoes at her, takes a bill out of his wallet, hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shoves her through the open door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fink!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom. Halfway there, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on. He detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr. Dreyfuss is working on the unconscious Fran. He has removed her coat, and is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her pupils. Bud approaches the bed worriedly.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She going to be all right, Doc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many pills were in that bottle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Dreyfuss ignores him. Out of his medical bag, he takes a stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end. Then he starts to lift Fran off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Between them, they get Fran into an upright position.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Into the bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
They half-carry, half-drag Fran's limp form toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do, Doc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Bud starts away as Dr. Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud loses no time getting into the kitchen. He fills an aluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas burner, puts the kettle on. Then he takes a jar of instant coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes an excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon in it. He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow with a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the bathroom, looks in anxiously. From inside come the sounds of a coughing spasm and running water. Bud turns away, undoes his tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. Something on the night table attracts his attention -- resting against the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. Bud picks it up -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word, JEFF. He turns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to do with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale, still unconscious Fran. Bud quickly conceals the suicide note behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring my bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
He lugs Fran into the living room. Bud stashes the letter in his back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair. Her chin falls to her chest. Dreyfuss takes the bag from Bud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from a bottle of picrotoxin.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roll up her right sleeve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Bud does so. Dr. Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud, searches for a spot for the injection.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice veins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
He swabs the spot with alcohol, takes the hypodermic back from Bud.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to tell me what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
(making off-scene injection)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Bud just stands there, taking it. Fran stirs slightly, and from her parched lips comes a low moan. Dr. Dreyfuss grabs her by the hair, lifts her head up.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd come home half an hour later, you would have had quite a Christmas present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
With his free hand, Dr. Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously across the face. Bud winces. Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by the hair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. He crushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her nose. Fran tries to turn her head away. Dreyfuss slaps her again, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is watching tensely. From the kitchen comes the whistle of the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Bud hurries into the kitchen. He turns off the gas, pours the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee, stirs it. From off, come the sounds of more slapping and some moaning. Bud carries the coffee out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss is working another ammonia ampule under Fran's nose. Her eyes start fluttering. Dreyfuss takes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran's lips, pours coffee into her mouth. Fran resists instinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and dress, but Dr. Dreyfuss keeps at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get some air in here. Open the windows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
Bud complies promptly -- pulls up the shades, opens the windows wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
(putting the empty mug down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's her name?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?

<DIRECTION>
(Fran mutters something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<FRAN>

	<DIALOGUE>

Bud picks up the mug, leaves.

<DR_DREYFUSS>

<FRAN>

	<DIALOGUE>

Bud throws Dr. Dreyfuss a look, as if to say that Fran's mind still wasn't functioning properly.

They lift her from the chair, and each draping one of her arms over his shoulder, they start to walk her up and down the room.

<DR_DREYFUSS>

(urging Fran on)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now walk, Fran. One, two, three, four -- one, two, three, four -- that's the idea -- left, right, left, right -- now we turn -- one, two, three, four --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
At first, Fran's feet just drag along the floor between them. But gradually, as Dr. Dreyfuss' voice continues droning hypnotically, she falls into the rhythm of it, repeating the words after him and putting her weight on her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left, right, left, right -- walk, walk, walk -- one, two, three, four -- turn -- left, right, left, right -- now you got it --

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the bedroom window comes the first faint light of dawn. Fran has been put to bed by an exhausted Dr. Dreyfuss. She is in her slip, and Dreyfuss is just drawing the blanket over her. Her eyes are closed, and she is moaning fitfully. Watching from the doorway is Bud, in shirtsleeves now, weary and disheveled.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --

	Just as long as she's okay.

	<DIALOGUE>
	These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.

</DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
They have now moved out into the living room, where the overhead light and the Christmas tree bulbs are still on.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any of that coffee left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_DREYFUSS>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He goes into the kitchen. Dr. Dreyfuss takes a small notebook with a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag, sinks down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you spell her last name?

	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --

<BUD>

	It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
<DIRECTION>
(a long look at Bud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.

<DIRECTION>
He walks out, closing the door after him. Bud dejectedly turns off the overhead light, kicks out the plug of the Christmas tree lights, trudges into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fran is fast asleep. Bud picks up her dress, gets a hanger, drapes the dress over it, hangs it from the door. An early morning chill has invaded the room, and Bud switches an the electric blanket to keep Fran warm. Then he slumps into a chair beside the bed, looks at Fran compassionately. The light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the grayish room. Bud just sits there, watching Fran.

INT. STAIRCASE - BROWNSTONE HOUSE - DAY

Mrs. Lieberman, followed by her dog, is climbing the stairs to Bud's apartment, puffing asthmatically. She seems quite angry as she arrives at the door and rings the bell. There is no answer. She starts knocking impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LIEBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Baxter. Open up already!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_LIEBERMAN>

Finally the door opens a crack, and Bud peers out. He looks like a man who has slept in his clothes -- rumpled, bleary- eyed, unshaven.

INT. THE APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom, looks inside. Fran is asleep under the electric blanket, breathing evenly. He tries to shut the bedroom door, but it won't close completely because Fran's dress, on a hanger. is hooked over the top. He goes to the phone, picks it up, dials the operator.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SHELDRAKE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The decor is split-level Early American. There is a huge Christmas tree and a jumble of presents, open gift boxes, and discarded wrappings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheldrake and his two sons, TOMMY and JEFF JR., are squatting on the floor, testing a Cape Canaveral set the kids got for Christmas. Sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown, with a manufacturer's tag still dangling from it, and the boys are in pajamas and astronaut's helmets. As for the Cape Canaveral set, it is a miniature layout of block-houses, launching pads, and assorted space-missiles. Tommy has his finger on the button controlling one of the rockets.

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a thought.

	Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

In the entrance hall, Sheldrake picks up the phone, turns his back toward the living room, speaks in a low voice.

Sheldrake turns from the phone. Halfway down the stairs is Mrs. Sheldrake, in a quilted house-robe.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
As Bud continues talking on the phone, Fran, in the bedroom, opens her eyes, looks around vaguely, trying to figure out where she is. She sits up in bed, winces, holds her head in her hands -- she has a fierce hangover.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you see, the doctor, he's a friend of mine -- we were very lucky in that respect -- actually, he thinks she's my girl -- no, he just jumped to the conclusion -- around here, I'm known as quite a ladies' man --

In the bedroom Fran, becoming aware of Bud's voice, crawls out of bed and holding on to the furniture, moves unsteadily toward the living room door.

<BUD>

	<DIALOGUE>

Behind him, Fran appears in the bedroom doorway, barefooted and in her slip. She leans groggily against the door post, trying to focus on Bud and to concentrate on what he's saying.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.

He crosses to the bathroom, takes a plaid robe off the hook on the back of the door, hands it to Fran.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here -- put this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
In the bathroom, he finds an unused toothbrush in a plastic container. His eyes fall on his safety razor. With a glance toward the bedroom, he unscrews the razor, removes the blade, drops it in his shirt pocket. Then he empties the blades from the dispenser, puts those in his pocket. Now he notices a bottle of iodine on the medicine shelf, stashes that in another pocket, just as Fran appears in the doorway wearing the robe.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>

	You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?

</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.

He removes the cards from her hand, starts to add them up.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty-two and twenty-five -- that's seventy-seven -- spades is double -- a hundred and fifty-four -- and four boxes -- you're blitzed in two games.

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the score on the pad. As he starts to shuffle again, he notices that Fran has slid down on the pillow, and that her eyes are closed -- she is asleep.
</DIRECTION>

Bud rises, adjusts the blanket over her. He stands there looking at her for a moment, runs his hand over his chin. Realizing he needs a shave, he crosses to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bathroom, Bud washes his face, squirts some shaving cream into his hand, starts to apply it.

A Volkswagen draws up to the curb in front of the house. Kirkeby gets out on the street side, Sylvia squeezes herself out through the other door.

Together, he and Sylvia start up the steps of the house, Sylvia already cha cha-ing in anticipation.

He glances at the sleeping Fran, picks up the tray, carries it into the living room, pulling the bedroom door closed behind him. But it doesn't shut completely, because of Fran's dress hooked over the top.

Bud crosses to the hall door, opens it. Outside are Kirkeby, with the champagne bucket, and Sylvia.

Miss Olsen hesitates for a second, then with a quick look around, she pushes the button down, carefully picks up the receiver, listens in.

Buddy-boy is bending over a hot stove, preparing an Italian dinner. He takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire, and picking up the tennis racquet with the other hand, pours the spaghetti on top of the racquet strings. Then he turns on the faucet, runs water over the spaghetti. With the combined technique of Brillat-Savarin and Pancho Gonzales, he gently agitates the racquet, letting the water drain off the spaghetti.

</FRAN>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I want you to keep a clear head.

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
The door bell rings. Carrying his martini glass, Bud crosses to the door, starts to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I don't want to take advantage of you -- the way I did yesterday in bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
By now the door is open, and Bud is speaking to Fran over his shoulder. He turns, finds himself face to face with Karl Matuschka, who is standing grimly in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MATUSCHKA>

	Baxter?

</MATUSCHKA>
<BUD>

Matuschka shoves him roughly aside, strides past him toward Fran, who has risen to her feet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.

</MATUSCHKA>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MATUSCHKA>
<DIRECTION>
(shoving him away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Karl -- I'll get dressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRAN>
<DIRECTION>
She exits into the bedroom, removing her dress from the door, and closing it. Matuschka leans against the wall beside the hall door, eyeing Bud truculently. Bud raises a finger to remonstrate with him -- then breaks into a nervous, ingratiating smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care for a martini? Champagne?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Matuschka continues glaring at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a little spaghetti with meat sauce? Made it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Matuschka just scowls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister-in-law sure is terrific --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizes his mistake; switching abruptly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be murder driving a cab in New York -- I mean, with all that cross-town traffic --

</BUD>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures with the martini glass, spilling the contents over his shirtfront. Through the partly open hall door, Dr. Dreyfuss sticks his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>

<DIRECTION>
Matuschka lashes out with a left to Bud's jaw, and while he is off balance, catches him with a right to the eye. Bud falls back against the Christmas tree, which topples with a crash. Fran pulls Matuschka away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRAN>

She follows Matuschka out. Bud looks after her, starry-eyed.

<DIRECTION>
(nods to himself with satisfaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plain fact is, Mr. Sheldrake, that I love her. I haven't told her yet, but I thought you should be the first to know. After all, you don't really want her, and I do, and although it may sound presumptuous, she needs somebody like me. So I think it would be the thing all around --

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<SHELDRAKE>

	Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.

He removes his dark glasses reflectively.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --

Camera pulls back to reveal the sign painter we saw earlier, working on the directory. Watching him is Bud. He is wearing his chesterfield and bowler, and still has a slight welt under his left eye. It is after six o'clock, and there is very little activity in the lobby.

Fran walks toward the revolving doors. Bud watches her for a moment, then strides briskly across the lobby toward the newsstand. He goes right past the waiting brunette, stops in front of a rack of pocket books, examines the merchandise.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally.

	Don't mind what?

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.

<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very clever.

	Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?

Without taking his eyes off Sheldrake, Bud reaches into his pocket, fishes out a key, drops it on the desk.

<SHELDRAKE>

He turns abruptly, starts back into his own office.

INT. BUD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Bud comes in, shutting the door behind him, stands rooted to the spot for a moment. Then he takes some pencils out of his breast pocket and drops them into a container on the desk, closes his account book, slams a couple of open file drawers shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he crosses to the clothes closet, the connecting door opens and Sheldrake comes in, key in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.

	That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.

</BUD>

He has taken his chesterfield and bowler out of the closet, and is putting the coat on.

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's gotten into you, Baxter?

</SHELDRAKE>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.

He opens the door to the anteroom, starts out.

INT. SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Bud comes out of his office, carrying his bowler, strides past the secretaries and through the glass doors to the foyer. An elevator is just unloading, and beside it a handyman is cleaning out one of the cigarette receptacles. Bud crosses to the elevator, and as he passes the handyman, he jams his bowler on the man's head -- surrendering his crown, so to speak. The elevator doors close. The handyman straightens up, looks around in bewilderment.

INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bud is in the process of packing. In the middle of the living room are several large cardboard cartons filled with his possessions. The art posters are off the walls, the bric-a-brac has been removed from the shelves, and Bud is stowing away the last of his books and records. He crosses to the fireplace, opens one of the drawers in the cabinet above it, takes out a forty-five automatic. He holds the gun in the palm of his hand, studies it appraisingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings. Bud snaps out of his reverie, drops the gun into one of the cartons, goes to the door and opens it. Standing outside is Dr. Dreyfuss, with a plastic ice bucket in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --

<BUD>

	Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

He goes into the kitchen, opens the refrigerator, starts to pry out the ice-cube trays.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you moving to?

	Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --

<DIRECTION>
He dumps the ice-cubes, still in their trays, into the bucket Dr. Dreyfuss is holding. Then he pulls Kirkeby's unopened bottle of champagne out of the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you use a bottle of champagne?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUD>
<DR_DREYFUSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.

</DR_DREYFUSS>
<BUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

Bud closes the door, returns to the kitchen, brings out a box of glassware and the tennis racquet. As he starts to deposit the racquet in a carton, he notices a strand of spaghetti clinging to the strings. He removes it gently, stands there twirling the limp spaghetti absently around his finger.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is five minutes before midnight, New Year's Eve. Sitting alone in the last booth is Fran, a paper hat on her head, a pensive look on her face. There are two champagne glasses on the table, and the usual noisemakers, but the chair opposite her is empty. Above the general hubbub, the Chinese pianist can be heard playing. After a moment, Fran glances off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Threading his way through the merrymakers crowding the bar and overflowing from the booths is Sheldrake. He is in dinner clothes, topped by a paper hat. Reaching the last booth, he drops into the chair facing Fran.

<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.

The piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised left arm. He drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go out. At the same time, he strikes up AULD LANG SYNE.

All over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet, embracing and joining in the song.

In the last booth, Sheldrake leans across the table, kisses Fran.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELDRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy New Year, Fran.

Fran's expression is preoccupied. Sheldrake faces in the direction of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings along with the others.

As AULD LANG SYNE comes to an end, the place explodes noisily -- there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted greetings. The lights come up again.

In the last booth, Sheldrake turns back toward Fran -- but she is no longer there. Her paper hat lies abandoned on her vacated chair.

EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT

Fran, a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the Rickshaw, comes down the street almost at a run. There is a happy, expectant look on her face. She hurries up the steps of the house and through the front door.

INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Fran mounts the stairs eagerly. As she reaches the landing and heads for Bud's apartment, there is a loud, sharp report from inside.

Fran freezes momentarily, then rushes to the door.

And that's about it. Story-wise.

FADE OUT.
