<DIRECTION>
NYFD Lt. GORDY PITT strains as he works the handle of an old-time, hand-cranked ice cream maker. It's a tough job requiring strength, patience and determination. In a nutshell, that's Gordy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent, watches Gordy crank away.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear the big news, Lieutenant? It's the twenty-first century. We got electricity now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy keeps cranking.
</DIRECTION>
<JUNIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got these supermarkets, too. Big places, freezers full o' ice cream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUNIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy stops. Pops the lid. Spoons out a dollop.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks the spoon in Junior's mouth. Junior eats. Junior loves it. Gordy smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw the twenty-first century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The FIRE BELL SOUNDS.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FIREHOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone scrambles. The choreography's practiced, automatic. It's achieved without conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The channel surfer slides down the fire pole. He's followed by the man who was upstairs snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Junior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the printout to the snorer, the company's "chauffeur."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and hitched with suspenders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow jackets are whipped on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to the men over the headsets --

The ENGINE SCREAMS and HONKS through the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - TENEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy moves back to his company, who have already hooked the engine up to water.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top story's fully involved. We're supporting inside. Two lines up the stairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
He points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE SHEA, a veteran firefighter of Irish descent.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior and Mike --

He points to the chess player, SAL DIBIASE, another FD veteran, Mediterranean descent, and then to the rookie, RONNIE BOOK, a New York melting pot mutt.

The chauffeur, ART WESTPHAL, German-Irish, stays with the engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two- man hose teams into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy hoses. Rats head past in the opposite direction, deserting the burning building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRD FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water. Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants, using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and Mike, indicates "up." Begins leading the hose team up the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
FOURTH FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the fourth floor. There's fire everywhere. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see a FIREFIGHTER from the other company. He has fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages around him. To Junior and Mike --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris, can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter. Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the firefighter.
</DIRECTION>
<FIREFIGHTER_1>

<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears the FAINT sound of SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts running. He's gonna jump it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first. Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into the door at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Gordy calls down to his men.

<DIRECTION>
Gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the ceiling. Turns it on full jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure stream bites into old, decayed plaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bit by bit the ceiling falls away. Gordy's almost through to the room above, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Falling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure. He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down. He's gotta get outta there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe. Attacks the hole again furiously, until finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens, to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up. Speaks to them in Spanglish --

INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them. It's the second child he's held in the last few hours. This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child. We see the deep affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne opens the shower door. She's on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at twelve. I have a patient relations meeting at twelve- fifteen. Can you take him?

	Let's get you out, sweetie. Your father just can't keep you dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds...

Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --

EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rivalry's intense. The game close. The noise deafening. Bets are going down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NYFD goes up by one in the final minute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting, devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him to defend.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luis, get back! Pick up your man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating around them. Gordy's proud of Luis.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lose, win, whatever. But one thing we never do. We never, ever give up. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts off, when a SOUND draws his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the fence, clearly trying to intimidate him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy stalks walking toward them. Calls --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off. Reaching Luis --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<LUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUIS>

But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BODEGA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH the window, we see Gordy delivering Luis to a Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner. We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's complimenting the boy to his dad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy emerges. Checks his watch. Whistles up a taxi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Traffic jam on Park Avenue South. Gordy's anxious. Checks his watch. He's late. To the cabbie --

</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy exits the cab and takes off running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
checks her watch again. She's pissed now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g., a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A caravan of Lincoln Navigators passes Anne and turns east on 68th.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns onto 68th. As he runs, he jumps, trying to see Anne and Matt over other pedestrians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g., the Navigators pull up at a building flying the Colombian flag. Latin and American men in suits get out of the Navigators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 68TH - BETWEEN FIFTH AND MADISON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy dodges pedestrians. Still trying to get a glimpse of Anne and Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles. In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE AND MATT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hear the WHISTLE. Matt sees Gordy.

<DIRECTION>
GORDY

waves back, shrugs an apology to Anne as he starts across the street, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTENSE FLASH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly lights up the intersection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In SLOW MOTION:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOCK WAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wave rolls up 68th past Madison...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE BALL OF FLAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
erupts behind Anne and Matt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the ENORMOUS BANG of the explosion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINDOWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are sucked into millions of fragments, a hailstorm of glass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREAT CHUNK OF METAL
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
instinctively pulls her child to her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees the engine block tumbling through the air toward his wife and son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His scream is lost in the thunderous ROAR all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY'S POV - IN SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The engine block is about to hit Anne and Matt, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FedEx TRUCK, WINDOWS SHATTERED, SKIDS past, wiping out Gordy's line of sight. When the truck clears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne and Matt are gone. The corner's empty. Just Matt's spaceship, slowly falling to the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air, tumbling, then smacks to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris. Then struggles to his hands and knees.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a large shard of glass embedded in his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but can't see them, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.
</DIRECTION>

Gordy screams out his agony --

in super slow-mo, we see a cop -- the one who later bumped into Gordy -- in front of the consulate. His hat is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his tinted glasses. As the cop faces more toward the camera, the expert freeze-frames. To Phipps --

Matt's coffin is taken from Gordy. As it is lowered...

A third bagpiper, farther away still, begins playing the song with the other two. One by one the first and second bagpipers finish their rounds, until there is just the third -- a haunting, mournful wail off into the distance. And then...

	<DIALOGUE>
	In an e-mail to the New York Times, a Marxist extremist known only as 'The Wolf,' states that the bombing was, quote, 'not an act of terror but an act of war, aimed at stopping your C.I.A. murderers and their fascist puppets from committing further acts of repression against the people of Colombia,' unquote... Two Colombian officials and an American military officer died in last Thursday's blast. Also killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a New York City firefighter, and their only child, four-year-old Matt... The President has vowed that the United States will avenge what he called 'this monstrous act of barbarism and cowardice'... Intelligence sources say the identity and whereabouts of The Wolf remain a mystery. They believe he has worked closely with radical elements in Latin America for more than twenty years and have linked him to numerous terrorist bombings, including the 1983 downing of a Peruvian airliner, which killed forty-two people, eleven of them Americans... The head of the Latin America Indigenous People's Committee, a group known to be sympathetic to the radicals in Colombia, talked to News Six in Queens.

	<DIALOGUE>
	... Bottom line? The place is as dangerous as a snakepit. You've got the different guerrilla groups, C.I.A., F.B.I., D.E.A., Colombian military, U.S. military, right- wing death squads -- and the only thing they've all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people... Hey, I'm Colombian, and I'll never go back...

SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY

As Gordy closes the front door, REVEAL Mike, the firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this must have required.

Gordy doesn't react. Beat. More serious now --
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Gordo.

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hears the tone. Looks over and meets Mike's eyes, seeing the genuine concern there.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Today, at 0700 hours Eastern Daylight Time, a joint United States/Colombian strike force launched a full-scale assault at a base camp of the Army of Colombian Liberation, or E.L.C., in Southern Colombia. The purpose of the mission was to punish the people behind the brutal bombing in New York City ten days ago... We are presently evaluating after-action reports from Special Operations Group, but feel confident that we have accomplished our mission...

Big cheers now. Toasts all around. Everyone in the place is happy for Gordy, who sits there a moment trying to absorb the news, then buries his face in his hands.

INT. LIVING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike's channel-surfing again. Gordy goes by the door, carrying his tools and looks in.

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
But Gordy has charged in and grabs the remote from Mike, switches channels back to CNN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CNN_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, we now see a homemade video of a masked figure wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunter's mesh face mask with a strange-smiling face painted on it in camo earth tones. The Wolf's body is hidden shadow, the voice digitally altered to a deep bass growl.
</DIRECTION>

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought you killed me. You didn't. I'm still here...

We see Gordy's demeanor shift, retreating to the obsessive, seething hatred he showed before.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I swear that for every freedom fighter you killed, ten Americans will die. And I will pick the time and the place. And I will enjoy it...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Pitt, Mr. Brandt'll have to get back to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UPDEGRAF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GORDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's mood is dark. It's not improved by hearing the bullshit in Updegraf's reply.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him not to bother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
He slams down the phone. Rips up Brandt's business card. He's alone with his frustration, with his rekindled hatred and rage. OFF Gordy, glaring at the photo of The Wolf on his wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AEROPUERTO EL DORADO (BOGOTA) - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armed police lead Rottweilers through the newly-arrived passengers. FIND Gordy in line. He wears jeans, polo shirt, Timberlands, carries a backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy advances to an IMMIGRATION OFFICER, hands over his documents. The agent studies Gordy's passport.
</DIRECTION>
<IMMIGRATION_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business or pleasure, senor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMMIGRATION_OFFICER>
<GORDY>

<IMMIGRATION_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One moment, senor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMMIGRATION_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The agent gets the attention of an IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR, and the two of them confer out of earshot a moment. The Superior looks over at Gordy. Then approaches.

	If you would come with me, please.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better for you to visit another country. For your own sake.

</IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... You giving me a choice?

</GORDY>
<IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. But not about staying in Colombia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door, addresses two armed policemen in Spanish. Turning back to Gordy --
</DIRECTION>
<IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These men will escort you onto whatever flight you wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out Gordy's passport. Beat. Gordy takes it, starts out. As he goes --
</DIRECTION>
<IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's The Wolf you're after, yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy stops, turns back. He says nothing, but the look on his face speaks volumes.
</DIRECTION>
<IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Then I've just done you a bigger favor than you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IMMIGRATION_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy doesn't respond. Just turns and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS AREA - OUTSIDE OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's flanked by the armed policemen, one with a Rottweiler. As they walk, a PA announcement in Spanish is repeated in English...
</DIRECTION>
<PA_ANNOUNCEMENT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Avianco flight 42 to Panama City is now open for boarding... Avianca flight 42 to Panama City is now open for boarding.

<DIRECTION>
OFF Gordy, having heard the announcement --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY (PANAMA) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The highway terminates here, far short of Colombia. The idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and drugs. From this point south lies the Darien Gap, a thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cab with a Panama City logo pulls up at road's end. Gordy gets out with the Panamanian CAB DRIVER. The Cab Driver indicates a Panamanian man waiting there with a .9mm on his hip.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My cousin, Ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Ever and Gordy exchange nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far's Colombia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cab Driver indicates distant mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beyond those mountains... The trail is very dangerous, but do not worry, Ever will get you there... You can pay him then... You can pay me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy pulls out his wallet, pays the Cabbie.
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gracias, senor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver gets back inside the cab. Out the window --
</DIRECTION>
<CAB_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Que la vaya bien.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAB_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He drives off. Gordy looks to Ever. Ever smiles, motions him to follow, then turns south and starts walking. As Gordy falls in behind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy and Ever pass through pristine tropical rain forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR STREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rushing fiercely through the jungle, Ever uses his machete to cut two lengths of bamboo. He hands one to Gordy and indicates how they'll ford the stream. Gordy nods, then follows Ever's lead into the perilous, belly- deep water. They struggle to maintain their balance, even with the sticks. When they reach the opposite bank, Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELICOPTER CARCASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out helicopter, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever. Gordy and Ever stop. Gordy glances at Ever. Ever's focused on the men and clearly doesn't like what he sees. Gordy looks back. The armed men advance toward them carefully, rifles in the ready position. Gordy watches them approach, wondering who they are and what they're going to do. Ever, frightened, takes a half-step back, then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes it into the base of Gordy's head, knocking Gordy out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men run up. One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets. They take his passport, wallet, and an NYFD T-shirt. And then they're gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HUMMINGBIRD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hovering over Gordy as he comes to. As it flies off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits up. Feels the bloody lump on his head. It hurts, but it's not serious. He searches his pockets and backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy stands. Looks around. He's alone. He's in the jungle... He keeps heading south.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy trudges on. The thick jungle's hot and humid, full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He meets a man coming the other way. Alarm gives way to the realization that the man is followed by a number of people, including women and children. As they pass Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy addresses the passing people. Indicates where he's standing.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aqui? Colombia?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
No one replies. Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and gets his attention. She runs back up the trail a short distance and stops. She draws a line in the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<COLOMBIAN_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Panama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLOMBIAN_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps backward over the line.
</DIRECTION>
<COLOMBIAN_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colombia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLOMBIAN_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She does it again.
</DIRECTION>
<COLOMBIAN_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Panama... Colombia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLOMBIAN_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE, however, she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her family. Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo lighter, says something to her. Whereupon the little girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him. Beat. Gordy takes them.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gracias.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people to flee for their lives, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill. At night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Gordy walks on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a break in the trees, sees a small town ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the bandage, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and photo inside the bandage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON TRAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy heads into the town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that ply Colombia's back-country roads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the small-statured Colombians pressed in around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FINCA (COLOMBIA) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sprawling farm/estate deep in the countryside. Beyond the hacienda, we see a military compound containing tents and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters. A recently arrived Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) sits on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HACIENDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Full of manned hi-tech command-and-control and surveillance equipment. A Colombian military operations officer, ROCHA, waits with an aide.

EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT

Gordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream. He looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus, unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his bearings. The dream lingers, depressing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

An oncoming bus flashes its headlights. As the buses pass, the ONCOMING DRIVER yells to Gordy's chiva driver.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

To the Man in the Yankees Cap as they walk --

<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of these people have papers?

<MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some have the wrong papers. Some have none...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
<DIRECTION>
The man puts a finger to his lips, hushing Gordy. They've come abreast of the checkpoint, which can be seen in the distance through the trees. Colombian soldiers have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection. The chiva's DIESEL GROWLS loudly. When suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIGURES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see figures moving in the forest between the group and the checkpoint. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE being directed at the soldiers at the checkpoint. In the same instant, an RPG takes out a Colombian Army humvee in a bright, fiery EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The man pulls Gordy down as the group hits the dirt. The GUNFIRE continues. On the ground, to Gordy --
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guerrilleros.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
<DIRECTION>
The attack rages furiously for twenty seconds, then wanes to sporadic GUNFIRE. Other WEAPONS are FIRING now, too -- clearly the Army is finally mounting a defense. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound of PEOPLE CRASHING through the forest. They're running toward Gordy and the group. The CRASHING GETS CLOSER. And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS PANTING of the guerrillas in retreat. BOOTS THUD past Gordy's head. When suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the running guerrillas trips over Gordy and goes sprawling. The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes of a fierce young woman. In a heartbeat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman jumps back to her feet, and joins her comrades laying down a suppressing FIRE at the soldiers. Spent cartridges rain down around Gordy, as the AK-47 ON FULL AUTO chops loudly over his head. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guerrillas are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up, yells --

<MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vaya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
<DIRECTION>
The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them. Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and begins to run. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers do notice them and begin to FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLIAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS SHRED the foliage around Gordy, whipping past his head... He and others keep running. A man goes down when a BULLET BITES into his leg. Gordy slows, but the Man in Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help. Slams him hard on his back. Keeps pushing Gordy forward. A few moments later, we hear M-16's on FULL AUTO back where they left the man.

EXT. SMALL RIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The powerful TORRENT ROARS through the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy and the others reach the near bank, where the path drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank. The Man in the Yankees Cap is in the lead. He plunges into the fast water up to his waist. Gordy and the rest splash in behind, struggling to cross against the swift current. The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far bank. Takes two steps, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLOSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! An EXPLOSION rips into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY AND OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stop mid-stream, but one of the group, a young woman, believing the blast was caused by the pursuing military, continues struggling to cross. An OLDER MAN looks, sees the blast-hole.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mina.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine." To the young woman --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy moves to catch her. Just manages to stop her as she reaches the far bank. Gordy points to where the land mine detonated.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mina... Mina...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the unpanicked, reassuring look on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand in the rushing river. He indicates for them to hold hands for stability. Motions for them to stay.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaves the group in the middle of the river. The GUNFIRE is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC. He crosses to the water's edge on the far bank. Pulls the Zippo from his pack and leans over. Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and rock immediately in front of him. Scratches lightly at the ground with the machete, searching for mines. Finds nothing in that spot. And steps onto it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Searching the ground and scratching at it with the machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in the Yankees Cap. Three steps from the river...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds a small, round anti-personnel mine the size of a hockey puck. He inches past it. Moves past another. And another. To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move... Don't move...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Gordy reaches him. One of the man's legs is missing below the knee. He's bleeding from various other wounds as well. Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area for more mines. Then kneels in a footprint.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be okay... You'll be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet around his thigh. By way of distracting him --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guerrilla bastards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Military... To stop guerrillas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_YANKEES_CAP>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has left the group and emerged from the river in a different place to avoid the mines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground. The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Alto!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and stops... But not before he plants his next step, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trip wire bows against his shin, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen in position, his leg still bowing the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca- Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection, Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade. There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to explode at chest level... And the can's almost off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN IN YANKEES CAP - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Gordy returns, the man's dead. OFF Gordy, looking down at the NY logo on the cap...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. ANOTHER CHIVA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out his map.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - MAP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He traces a road from the town. The road runs south through the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the ELC capital.

EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FERRY'S WHISTLE TOOTS. Lines are cast off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry load and now relax their vigil. One man holds a Xerox of Gordy's passport photo. The other bites into an empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down the front of his shirt. His partner finds it funny. He doesn't. And while their attention's occupied...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence, and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERRY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's packed. Gordy picks his way through. The only other gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme hat that says "Deerborn." The geek, PHILIP ARMSTRONG, looks like a talker, and Gordy tries to avoid eye contact. He's too late.
</DIRECTION>

</ARMSTRONG>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause no one in their right mind would ever go back. Caguan's in the guerrilla zone run by the E.L.C. E.L.C. as in 'Extra Loathsome Communists.' They don't care, and they kill. I'm going there myself. But I have a 'get outta jail free' card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Armstrong doffs his cap, undoes a safety pin securing a card inside the crown. Shows it to Gordy. Sotto --
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	E.L.C. travel pass. I can go anywhere I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(by way of explanation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone needs equipment fixed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat. And now his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone --
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't have one of these, you don't want to be up there, Gordy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped deck, leaning against his father. Gordy reaches over and taps the boy. The boy looks over. Shrinks away at the sight of the large gringo. The father notices and looks at Gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Por favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The father's also apprehensive, doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Con mucho gusto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy boy on his lap. Nods his thanks at Gordy, who then gazes down at the son. A kid about Matt's age. Armstrong recognizes the look of a caring dad.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got kids, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Armstrong, as Gordy walks away...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Colombian armed man wearing guerrilla uniforms bearing a distinctive ELC patch are walking a trail, when the man in front notices something odd. He stops. Leads the other man back a few steps. Looks into the foliage along the trail. Something doesn't seem right. He extends his AK-47. Prods a hump of greenery with the rifle butt, and in a flash...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing face-paint and full-body military camouflage gear and pointing twin cocked-and-locked CAR-15 assault rifles at the heads of the startled guerrillas.

(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pass is only good for one person, if that's your idea, which I think it is... Besides, I can't risk traveling around up there in the company of a big gringo with a dumb-ass cover story about coffee beans.

Gordy looks over. Armstrong smiles back. Beat.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see the beginnings of Mompos. Two 4x4 trucks are parked on the riverbank. Lean, clean-cut men in jeans, tight shirts, cowboy boots and sunglasses lean on the truck and watch the ferry pass.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sicarios. Death squads. Avoid those dudes at all costs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - FEW MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ferry pulls up to the dock. The dock street is a culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders, of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts. There's a definite air of menace.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Federales are looking for someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy follows Armstrong's look to two plain-clothes federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock watching the boat pull up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Gordy glances back, Armstrong is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOMPOS FERRY DOCK - DAY

<FAT_FEDERALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with us, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_FEDERALE>
<DIRECTION>
He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's not gonna go down easy, though.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way. He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's four men trying to tackle a bull, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bull gets away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit.

GORDY

<DIRECTION>
jukes into a local bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered courtyard, where he's surrounded by ten-foot walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDERALES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blast through the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOP OF WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up. He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step thundering, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDERALES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
burst into the courtyard. Two men hastily build a stack of boxes, etc., against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs as fast as he can across the rooftops, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks across the rooftops... and Gordy's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans and coffee. The building is dark and dusty. He lies still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice, pulls them over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDERALE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>

sees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath. Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof. And Gordy can breathe again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOMPOS STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier town. A noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels. Everyone's packing a gun. A new Dodge City, where death squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's BLARING SALSA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TROPICALE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of local "hostesses" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly, revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but now Gordy can see the "Deerborn" logo clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap. It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts toward the girl, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving in on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy moves faster toward the girl. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab, and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's almost to the hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Armstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never met a nose I couldn't hang a spoon on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too, wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yahtzee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat Federale addresses Gordy --
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_FEDERALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come along, Mr. Pitt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_FEDERALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy --
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police catch you trying to steal my hat, you asshole?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers toward Gordy. Grabs the hat.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking hat thief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead of hitting Gordy, Armstrong accidentally-on- purpose clocks the fat detective. Then hisses into Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk --
</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMSTRONG>
<DIRECTION>
But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts surprise the Armstrong neural network.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just behind the ear... And Gordy gets to know the floor, too.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough. They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales. The Fat Federale has Armstrong's hat. He looks it over, wondering why Gordy wanted it. Then decides he could give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong. Clangs the cell door shut and locks it. Leaves shaking his head.

Armstrong just shakes his head. Beat.

<DIRECTION>
DOOR TO CELL AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANGS open. Federales lead in two men -- the two guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged infiltrators. The federales are armed with batons and stun guns, taking no chances. It's clear the rebels weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face- first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the cell. A solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and Armstrong. Armstrong's seen the patches on their uniforms. To Gordy, sotto --

Two or three A.M. Armstrong's dozing. Gordy's still listening to the MURMURING of the REBELS on the other side of the wall, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a flurry of activity outside the cell area. The door opens. Soldiers enter with some federales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy watches the soldiers move past his cell. Rocha is with them. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brandt appears at the bars, looks in at Gordy.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

In a field near Mompos, a canopied truck backs into position. Men in guerrilla uniforms with ELC patches get out and pull back the canopy, revealing mortar tubes pointing skyward on a bed of sand.

KA-BOOM! The front door and wall of the jail disintegrate under the multiple LAW attack.

Brandt, Rocha and the soldiers, approaching the front door inside, are hammered by the massive concussion of the BLAST and flung across the room, apparently dead.

The powerful, concussive shock-wave channels into the cell area. Gordy's slightly protected by a wall. Armstrong, standing at the bars, is thrown into the opposite wall and knocked unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUERRILLAS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
charge inside with AKs BLAZING. Surviving soldiers and federales SHOOT back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blasts have caused fires in the building. Severed wires spark, creating more fire. Flames begin to spread through the tinder-dry structure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guerrillas take out the soldiers and federales, with few casualties to themselves. They make their way toward the cell area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLODING AMMO and stored FUEL CANS accelerate the fire.

<DIRECTION>
The guerrillas reach the cells. Two men see Gordy and draw down on him. The others move to the next cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guerrillas plant small explosive charges on the hinges of the cell containing their two captured comrades. Beat. The HINGES BLOW. The beaten man and the rebel with him are freed, and the guerrillas quickly retreat the way they came.

Gordy sees flames spreading into the cell area.

INT. GORDY AND ARMSTRONG'S CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's fire and smoke everywhere. Gordy picks up the metal bunk and slams it against a wall. Slams it again. Breaks the metal apart. Then levers a long side rail in the cell door. He heaves. Heaves again. The fire's licking at him, but Gordy's undeterred. He heaves again, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, the door gives. Gordy picks up Armstrong's cap, then picks up Armstrong, who's starting to come around. Puts Armstrong over his shoulders in a fireman's carry.

The town's in complete chaos. There are fires everywhere.
</DIRECTION>

Still stunned and bleeding, Brandt looks from where he lies on the ground as...

<DIRECTION>
Gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying Armstrong. They're singed and smoking, but they're alive. Gordy drops Armstrong, pats himself and Armstrong down, knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and hair, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's eyes meet Brandt's. The two men hold the look for a moment. If Brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at Gordy to stop, not to go on. And Gordy knows it. But Gordy's not stopping. Picks up Armstrong again and moves off toward the waterfront.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOMPOS WATERFRONT - NIGHT

There's less chaos here. The fires are in the distance.

	No. I told you. The pass is only good for one person. And you're too dangerous to travel with.

</DIRECTION>
<ARMSTRONG>

Two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed ELC guerrillas move to intercept it.

<DIRECTION>
The Boatman slows, puts the panga in neutral and keeps his hands in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One boat of guerrillas pulls alongside. The other sheers off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass. One of them takes it. Reads. Looks Gordy over. Then starts to rip the pass in half, when...
</DIRECTION>

He stops. Grins. It's a big joke. He hands back the pass, searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on.

INT. ELC SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ELC SUPERVISOR for Caguan may be a Marxist, but the clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a big-screen Sony and leather furniture. The TV's TUNED TO CNN. A photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an ELC patch and holding an AK-47. A brass nameplate reading "Supervisor" rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself -- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his position. He's not in cammies now -- his uniform now consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat Rolex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix is a subordinate here. He and Gordy stand across the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordy's travel pass. Gordy's nervous about what could appear on the TV in the b.g., but tries not to show it.

The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same.

Felix respectfully interjects. It's almost a plea.

Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive, looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf, searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third- world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy, seeing another side of the guerrillas...

Gordy has to think of something fast. Beat. He throws a machine part against a wall angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't work with these pieces of junk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junk? These generators cost a fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then treat them that way.

</GORDY>
<FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Armstrong always fixes them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Armstrong wants your money. He makes them work, but he doesn't fix them... To do this right, we gotta order parts from Europe. In the meantime, I can make something temporary. There must be a machine shop in town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Yes.

Gordy stands.

</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Felix, forced to acquiesce...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it. But it's all he can do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMPTY STOREFRONT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass an empty storefront. A sign on the large, front plate glass window says "Cine" and "Sabado."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a bar. Felix watches it go by with something like a look of desire. Gordy registers the look and the connection to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy selects spare parts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper. He smears grease from his hands over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy finishes loading the parts into the Land Cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thirsty. How about you? Want to get something to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Felix pauses. We see the look of desire again. Gordy's definitely struck a chord. But Felix quickly stifles it.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to get back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been working all day out in the sun. I need a drink... nice cold beer? How about it? I saw a bar in town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Felix really wants to, but still hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the spare parts, I'll have the generators running in two hours... We have time for a couple beers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Finally --
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Just a beer. Maybe two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've had a lot more than two beers. Felix has, anyway. He's drunk. He's also in love with a waitress on his lap, a cute gordita named BERTA. He pats her.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is mine. This is the reason I come here... right, Berta? Me amas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<BERTA>
<DIRECTION>
(playing along)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si, amor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTA>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody whistles for a drink, and Berta goes.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... She's hot, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Long beat. Gordy makes the play he's been contemplating.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Armstrong said to watch my butt around here. I guess the fucking Americans come down and shoot everyone all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially now, since the bomb in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I heard about it. Who did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Felix is just loose enough.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Wolf, and they'll never catch him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever see him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; eyes Gordy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you know too much around here, it can get you killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's gotten all he'll get from Felix. He feigns nonchalance, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what doesn't get you killed around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy takes a swig of beer. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos. The man has just walked in with another guerrilla.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross the room. At the bar, the bartender puts out two crates of beer. The guerrillas take the beer and head out. No money's changed hands. When they're gone, to Felix --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd better get back, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Shit. It's late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two guerrillas are just driving away in a big- wheeled, high ground-clearance Suburban as Gordy and Felix emerge. Felix is weaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy keeps his eyes on the Suburban's tail lights and opens the Land Cruiser's passenger door for Felix.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too drunk. I'll drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy gets in. Felix hands Gordy the keys. Then slumps against his door and closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day, I'm going to screw Berta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy STARTS the CAR and drives after the Suburban.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles --
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'll take her to a small restaurant... We'll have lobster and drink lots of wine... I'll get her drunk... We'll drive home... I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss her... And then, I'll screw her in my bed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
The Suburban pulls up next to a house. There are armed guerrilla guards outside.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And when I am done screwing her, she'll never want to look at another man again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start carrying the beer inside. And a moment later...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix comes around with a start.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, easy... What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going the wrong goddamn way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am?... Looks different in the dark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy turns the car around. Felix keeps the gun on him.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drive where I say... Or the Supervisor will have us both shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the other way: a large propane tank next to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANTATION - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The work in the sheds continues. Heat lamps dry down the long tables of coke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUERRILLA GUARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are more vigilant at night, patrolling the grounds with posted teams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WORK LIGHTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
illuminate the two big diesel generators as Gordy continues his overhaul. He has two sentries now. One wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to the grenades hanging on the vest's front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's still working under the watchful eyes of the guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest and shirt, and runs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades. With the other guard still watching him closely, however, there's nothing Gordy can do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy grabs a grenade. Almost gets it into a tool box, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the grenade's still visible as now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover. And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's afternoon. Yesterday, you said it would only take two more hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have this one ready to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The heat lamps brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as the DIESEL ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head pound even harder.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the other one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just need another part from town, and it's five more minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Shit. Fine. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy grabs the tool box.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why're you bringing the tool box?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The old part's in there. I need to match it, and it's all greasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Felix buys it and heads off. As Gordy follows him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the "Cine" in the storefront. The ELC Supervisor's big-screen TV is being wheeled in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees an attractive woman playing with some children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY AND FELIX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drive past the bar. Gordy notices Felix doesn't even glance at it.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Berta working today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! Puta!

</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
We see that, whatever this means, it's an unexpected complication for Gordy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy chooses the spare part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clerk wraps the part in newspaper.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Gordy loads the part into the Land Cruiser. To Felix --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You as thirsty as I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Felix gets into the Land Cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy climbs in. Felix starts driving. Gordy's down to final straws.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't stop for one beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's beer at the plantation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no Berta at the plantation. I like drinking beer around pretty girls, not a bunch of guys with automatic rifles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hell with Berta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? Last night you were in love with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a beat. Felix glances at Gordy. Decides it's safe to confide.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I had a dream... I fed her lobster, got her drunk, and she rejected me for another man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Gordy's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dreams tell the future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... That wasn't a dream, that was the alcohol talking... You saying two men can't go have a beer and look at women's breasts because of pink elephants?... Nothing makes any sense down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Felix pulls out his .9mm. Gordy doesn't blink an eye.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead and shoot me, and you fix the goddamn generator. Part's in the back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. OFF Felix, thinking it all over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A replay of last night. Felix is pretty wasted. Berta's in his lap again. In Spanish --
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'm your man, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Someone whistles for a drink. Berta starts to stand. Gordy slips her twenty US dollars to stay. She does.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to piss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy crosses, exits into the bano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAR - BACK - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy drops out the bathroom window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's too short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAGUAN - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone coming. He's re-tracing the route he took the night before, when he followed the Beaten Man's Suburban.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"CINE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes the "Cine" in the storefront. A movie's beginning to play on the supervisor's big-screen TV. The place is packed. No one sees Gordy, who moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues to make his way through Caguan, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rounds a corner, and there's a four-man ELC patrol, two in a truck and two out. Gordy turns, starts heading back, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the GUERRILLAS calls to him.
</DIRECTION>
<GUERRILLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alto!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUERRILLA>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks it over. In butchered Spanish --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo trabajo con Felix. Felix --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- la cantina. Con Berta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy. A guerrilla waves them on. The woman and boy hustle by, glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as they pass. They hurry on toward the nearby "Cine."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start walking to the truck...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guerrilla patrol has taken Gordy to Felix, still sitting with Berta in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to get us both killed?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make sure he's on a shorter leash.

</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
The patrol leader looks at Felix hard. Then nods. The guerrillas go. Felix dumps Berta onto her feet, stands. Felix looks at Gordy, shakes his head.

<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...

Gordy looks down, sees the spoon of the grenade exposed. As he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix is right there supervising for himself as Gordy finishes working. Gordy stands. He stares hopefully at the MACHINE. Then pushes the starter, and... VRROOM! The heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy turns to Felix.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That make you happy?

INT. HACIENDA - STOREROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights. The room's a mess. All kinds of rubbish. There's a washtub sink. There's a cot.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This where Armstrong stays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<FELIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where you stay... A boat will take you down river at seven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
Felix closes the door. We hear a LOCK TURNING. Gordy moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked. Through a small window, he can see the lights in the sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door. THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in this direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room. We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the wall with the window. With the DIESELS covering the noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The big-wheeled guerrilla Suburban drives in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STOREROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he hears the VEHICLE arrive. He moves to the window by the door and looks out. Sees the Suburban. Four guerrillas are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to question Felix...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is being covered by the DIESELS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole. Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The Beaten Man finishes with Felix. Felix begins leading the guerrillas toward the storeroom.

Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet. And he won't, not in enough time. Under his breath --

</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
And just then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANTATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to see what's happening. At which point, the generator now BURSTS into FLAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just in time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>

The water jet breaks through. The hole's still small. Gordy begins to widen it.

Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume their march toward the storeroom.

Gordy's gone. The Beaten Man signals two men to go out the hole. To the other man --
</DIRECTION>
<BEATEN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Organize the others. Find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATEN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone --
</DIRECTION>
<FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't be far. You'll catch --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELIX>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water still streaming across the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation --
</DIRECTION>
<BEATEN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep looking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATEN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
He signals his men to come with him. They get into the Suburban. Whereupon we FIND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER SUBURBAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other, to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START, grabs the transfer case, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBURBAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROARS off with Gordy suspended below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy- duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going to be a long, dangerous ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the darkened town...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The grenade falls, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to lose it. And just as it falls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags the grenade before it drops to the road. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach, where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back. Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Suburban passes the "Cine." The movie's over, just letting out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again right away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on the side away from the house. Hides behind a large wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't looking, when he reaches one tree, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK! A coconut hits the ground next to him, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the guards comes to investigate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to roll away, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there. But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the wall. Looks into another room, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man, packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's nothing familiar about him, either. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room. He's also in ELC guerrilla camo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Gordy, looking intently at the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - SURVEILLANCE TAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The face of the cop outside the consulate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the room. His face looms larger as he ADVANCES TOWARDS us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - COP'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
when he bumped into Gordy on E. 64th Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MAN (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the room. It's the same face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's found The Wolf, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a guard appears, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy freezes. Eases into the shadows. His dirty face and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand, holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring- loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now, Gordy's going up in the blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands. Gordy squeezes out as much as he can onto them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Gordy gets the hell out of there. He finds cover. Ducks down. And waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - GRENADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle SINGING. He looks in the direction of the sound, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's eyes flash with alarm. He glances at the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - GRENADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands, which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and stretch from the pressure of the spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy looks back at the Woman and boy, closer now, walking toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - NEW YORK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne and Matt wave to him across Madison Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy sees the Woman pull the boy close to her, lovingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - NEW YORK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOMB EXPLODES, and Anne moves to protect Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GORDY (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He realizes the horror of what will happen. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy bursts from his hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Stop! Alto!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman and Boy look over in alarm, see Gordy running toward them and yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - GRENADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rubber bands are about to break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman sees Gordy. Screams toward the house --
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudio!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
see Gordy running. They OPEN FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
pile out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STOP FIRING. Gordy's too close to the Woman and Boy now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches the Woman and Boy now. Pulls them down. Covers them protectively with his body, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM! A gigantic EXPLOSION lights up the night and utterly destroys the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEBRIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rains down for what seems like forever. Dust fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
opens his eyes. Gets to his hands and knees. Sees the Woman and Boy are safe, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground, rolling him away from the Woman and child.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf's alive and unhurt. Angrily punts Gordy again.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can kill The Wolf?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
A boot in the face this time.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can kill The Wolf?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
A piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets and fluttered to the ground nearby. The woman picks it up, and we see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the photo of Anne and Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman stares at the photo a moment, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy absorbs another blow. He tries to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed my wife and son --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Whack! The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against Gordy's skull. Gordy drops hard. The Wolf reverses the AK. Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the trigger, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy. The Woman squeezes his arm. Implores him --
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf glances over. Meets her eyes a moment. Sees the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again. They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy --
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were just saved by your guardian angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked -- but the physical aches are nothing compared to the anguish he feels for having failed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards. He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the men in the jail with you in Mompos is dying. He was burned in your explosion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy just looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and frees his leg from the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to kill me? Come and kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
The bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then springs for The Wolf, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right away... and The Wolf drops him again.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Americans think you have all the answers. And really, you're so naive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... You see one peasant with a gun, and you never ask why he has to have it. You just run to give your billions to the nearest soldiers, no matter how merciless or corrupt they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
The last kick really hurt Gordy. He's slow rising.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I'm teaching America a lesson... that's why there'll be more bombs... and more families like yours will pay the price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WOLF>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard. Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall. Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen. All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys. Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to his midsection. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we hear a gentle CLACKING sound. It's unidentifiable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black becomes a BLUR. The BLUR becomes a hazy glimpse of Selena. She's sitting on the metal bed frame nursing Gordy's wounds. The CLACKING sound CONTINUES -- it's made by SEA SHELLS that dangle from a bracelet on Selena's wrist. The shells knock together as she washes Gordy's wounds.

The CLACKING sound CONTINUES. And...

<DIRECTION>
GORDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, when Gordy opens his eyes, there's no blurriness. It's a new day. He's better. Selena's walking to him with a tray. The SHELL BRACELET CLACKS as she approaches.

Selena watches him a moment, troubled by something.

Selena watches him another moment. Decides he's telling the truth. She reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends her hand toward Gordy. He looks up. She's holding the photo of Anne and Matt. Beat. Gordy takes the photo. Looks at his wife and son. Selena sits next to him. Another beat. Then, off the photo...
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudio used to be a teacher. I was a medical aid worker. We met in Guatemala, in an Indian village called Guamaunco. We were married there. Sophia, our daughter was born there. Claudio was kind and loving, and we were happy... We were there four years when the civil war broke out... The guerrillas were all around us, but left us alone... Then they made an attack on the army nearby. The next night, soldiers came to our village. They were led by American 'advisors'... They accused us of helping the rebels. Our women were raped. Our men were tortured. Our homes were burned... We crawled out into the fields, but they threw grenades, and Sophia...

<DIRECTION>
It's RAINING buckets. Most of the people inhabiting the village have been driven under roofs or indoors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guerrillas drag Gordy roughly up out of the bunker into the tropical DOWNPOUR. They march him out into the open. Throw him to the ground. A man draws his pistol as Gordy gets to his hands and knees. The GUERRILLA puts the pistol to Gordy's forehead.
</DIRECTION>

<GUERRILLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bath time... You stink, gringo.

The guerrillas laugh. Gordy throws the soap in the mud. Gets to his feet. Points his face up into the soothing rain... When he hears ARGUING and looks over to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOLF AND SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are inside a small house nearby, obviously fighting about something. Selena emphasizes her argument by slapping her hand. The Wolf storms off, and we hear a DOOR SLAM. Selena is left alone, disconsolate, framed in the window. She looks up and sees Gordy outside. Her eyes meet his. OFF their look...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CIA HACIENDA - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's POURING here, too. In b.g., assault preparations are underway in spite of the rain. Brandt checks his watch. Then lights another butt from the one he just smoked. Stares off into the distance, his thoughts intense and far away. Updegraf emerges, crosses.

Water drips from jungle leaves and the eaves of buildings. We see the bustling life of the place, the families, the women and children who live with and support the well-organized and high-tech guerrilla military. The village is simple but decidedly not primitive. These people have generators, a satellite dish and a school with a computer. At night, the school is a TV room. Right now on the tube Daffy's getting his beak blown off.

The Blackhawks, black and menacing, sit on an illuminated tarmac as:

Heavily armed troops in black uniforms and assault vests load up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Door gunners check mini-guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ground crews yank arming ribbons on rocket pods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A co-pilot in a specially rigged helmet tests his forward mini-gun: wherever he looks, the gun points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pilots finish checklists, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chopper ENGINES start WHINING. ROTORS begin to TURN. The noise mounts to an incredible ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - L.O.H.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small helicopter's rotors are also turning. Brandt stands at the chopper door with Updegraf. Slams the magazine on a Glock .45, making sure it's in solid, then slides the pistol into his shoulder holster. He checks his watch. Loud, to Updegraf --

Gordy moves to the right side of the door. Selena knocks. The door swings inward to the left. Selena exits with the tray. The guard reaches to close the door, and Gordy brings the pipe down hard on his head, knocking him out. Gordy retrieves the guard's AK-47.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy and Selena ascend the bunker steps. They stop at the top and peer into the village. An armed guerrilla approaches, unaware of their presence. Gordy fumbles with the AK-47, looking for the safety switch on the strange weapon. Selena reaches over and expertly flicks it off. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear the sound of the CHOPPERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guerrilla approaching them stops and looks up. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOM! The first wave of BLACKHAWKS FLASHES OVER the village. Selena and Gordy barely have time to duck as ROCKETS EXPLODE into ground targets, and front and door MINI-GUNS SPIT BULLET-STREAMS that RIP THROUGH people and STRUCTURES. And then the first wave's past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUERRILLAS

<DIRECTION>
In the momentary lull after the first wave, guerrillas run to pre-arranged fighting positions. Women and children are screaming.

SELENA

pulls Gordy from the steps. They start to run. But not far. Just seconds after the first wave of Blackhawks has left, the second wave hits.

BLACKHAWK CO-PILOT'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The village and all its details are visible as different shades of green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see rockets streak toward parked guerrilla vehicles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see rockets trail fire toward the TV in the school, which is then obliterated in a FIERY EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wherever the co-pilot looks, the forward MINI-GUN aims its hellish RAIN OF BULLETS. We TRACK WITH a running guerrilla and see him chopped down, then SWIVEL TO a gun pit and watch the men there eat lead.

He sees the burning school. Watches the continuing slaughter caused by the ROCKETS and MINI-GUNS.

The SAM ZIPS past the hot, bright flares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second wave's gone. Gordy and Selena start to run again. Buildings burn. The SCREAMING's endless. Gordy almost trips over the burned body of a child. And now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIRD WAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLASTS in over the treetops. These are the Blackhawks carrying the assault troops. They use a "skid 'n' git" maneuver to insert the men, coming in hot, MINI-GUNS BLAZING, barely touching down as the soldiers spill out, then tipping forward to gain speed and quick peeling out in a hard right turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy and Selena hit the dirt again as the choppers come in and land the troops, and the ground BATTLE ERUPTS.

Gordy and Selena are in his sights. They'll never make the trees. When...

BULLETS WHIP the water around Gordy, Mauro and Selena. They hide behind the cans. BULLETS PING OFF the METAL.

They're swept through some rocks, blocking them from the Soldier, who FIRES anyway. BULLETS CHIP the STONE.
</DIRECTION>

There's one more clear shot after the rocks. They're almost around a bend. The Soldier aims. BANGS! And...

Selena's hit. Gasps. Gordy looks over, calls.

Everyone's aboard and buckled in. Everyone's tired. The chopper lifts off. Selena's glaring at Brandt, who pushes a headset at her, shouts over the ENGINE WHINE --

</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Gordy hates going along with Brandt, but has no choice, nods to Selena. She takes the headset. As she puts it on, Brandt sees her pack. Takes it and opens it. He inspects it, then hands it back. Gordy glares at him. Brandt meets his eyes. A long beat. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wasn't even there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>

Brandt doesn't reply. Just holds the look a moment longer. Then looks out the window and ignores Gordy.

INT. UNION STATION (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY (AFTERNOON)

The daily tide of humanity flows through the railway terminal. We see people in business suits, tourists, families, a group of kids on a field trip. And standing in the middle of it all, we FIND...

CLAUDIO

Selena looks over at her son sleeping in Gordy's arms. She lovingly brushes the hair off his forehead, rattling her seashells. The leather doll is about to fall from Mauro's fingers. Selena takes the doll and puts it into her bag. Then looks out at the passing scenery. OFF Selena, in the land of her husband's enemy --

A man sits on a bench. He's wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap. He puts a shoulder bag on the bench, takes something out, then gets up and walks away, when...

Suddenly, two tourists and a hot dog vendor are right on him. One of 'em jams a concealed gun jammed into his ribs, while the other two hustle him forcefully to a van. He's shoved inside. His bag's tossed in. The van drives away.

Claudio GUNS the BIKE toward them.

Selena hears the BIKE. Sees Claudio coming. Uses the front edge of her hand to strike the female agent hard in the throat. The agent falls to her knees trying to suck air through a crushed windpipe. Selena whip-kicks the other agent to the ground.

Claudio brakes hard next to Selena, who takes the female agent's pistol and spare magazines as...

Claudio GUNS the BIKE down the second street, parallel to Gordy's alley. He and Selena reach an intersection with the one-way street. A right turn will complete the "U" and take them back toward Gordy. Straight ahead, the street they're on is one-way in the opposite direction. Claudio hangs right and cranks on the speed.

<DIRECTION>
He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike.
</DIRECTION>

Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too. The three of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati spins, flips and disintegrates.

CLAUDIO

SELENA

A shovel lies in the grass. Selena scoops it up and in one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly, as Gordy runs through the gate, and...
</DIRECTION>

GORDY

Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a playroom. Gordy's right behind her.

gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from falling all the way to the bottom. He sits the uninjured girl down and continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a renovation. Without stopping, she tears through the plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the rest of the house. She topples what she can into Gordy's way. Throws nails down behind her. Grabs a circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him and shattering a large wall mirror.

Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield -- this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leads into the dining room. Selena runs in. Gordy's right on her heels. Selena pulls down dining room chairs in front of Gordy. He vaults one but trips over the second and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all the noise. Both women tumble. Selena gets right back on her feet. She breaks out a window with the crowbar and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN HOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window Selena slipped through easily is small for Gordy. He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious seconds. Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the fire escape steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena's in a teenager's bedroom. The teenager's got headphones on, oblivious to everything. Selena darts through a bathroom into a second bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters the first bedroom behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN GARDENING CLOTHES and holding a digging tool stands on a stairwell landing, alarmed and confused by the chaos she hears in her house. She had started down the stairs but now has turned back at the sound of the WINDOW BREAKING on the top floor. Calls.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_GARDENING_CLOTHES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_IN_GARDENING_CLOTHES>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs, above the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_IN_GARDENING_CLOTHES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you? What are you doing in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_IN_GARDENING_CLOTHES>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees an open rooftop door at the top of a flight of stairs and charges upward without answering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the hallway a second later. Meets the Woman In Gardening Clothes, who's now come up the stairs. She screams. Swipes at him with the digging tool, making three deep scratches in his face. Gordy doesn't stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN HOUSE - ROOF/ADJOINING ROOFTOPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop flower bed. Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs to the next town house roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hits the roof behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of town houses, we see her warrior determination and discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally well-trained and determined firefighter. And he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her. Selena strains harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
vaults a gap. Moments later, Gordy vaults it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
finally runs out of roof. She looks down. A fire escape ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar, Selena takes the ladder down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands, squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where, across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate opens onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm. Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either. Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a living.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps. Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk. Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's between Selena and the only way out. And there's no way she's getting past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can. It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over, the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit. It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg. It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate. Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can across the slate pavers, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have to kill him before he'd let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses in her ear --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; with contempt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One woman, one boy -- they mean nothing next to the thousands who've been slain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hears it. It only drives him to a deeper fury.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's blind with rage. Chokes her neck hard. Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of the person who took Anne and Matt from him. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't... it's all he's wanted since he saw Anne and Matt die, but now he can't do it. He's a firefighter. He saves lives. If he kills Selena, Gordy crosses into her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes part of that sadness and death... And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe. Selena gasps for air. The impulse to murder has left Gordy. There's a new resolve...
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The killing ends here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Selena pants.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will never end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the building. He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man holding a smaller woman in a chokehold. Draws his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<EMBASSY_SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBASSY_SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun. Selena screams.
</DIRECTION>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<EMBASSY_SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBASSY_SECURITY_GUARD>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<SELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's trying to kill me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SELENA>
<EMBASSY_SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go, or you're dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMBASSY_SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He's going to shoot. Gordy has no choice. As he lets Selena go and stands --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold us both till the police get here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's too late. Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands. She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off. Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the same moment, Gordy grabs the crowbar from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SELENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flicks off the safety and points the gun again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurls the crowbar with all his might, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUN FIRES, just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling her aim. The bullet creases the guard's arm. Selena recovers. And the next BULLET...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Isn't hers. It's from Phipps' GUN. It takes Selena in the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way through her body. She's dead on her feet. Her body crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large pool that quickly spreads over the slate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER AGENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol. He walks to Gordy. The two men share a long, silent look. It's over. Gordy looks again at Selena's body in its pool of blood. Then turns and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRANDT'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out. Brandt's seen Selena. He's smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got the bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDT>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hits him. One of the jackhammer blows he slammed into Claudio in the bunker. A hard fist deep in the gut that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his knees. Beat. Gordy's voice is cold and hard --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're no better than she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
And Gordy goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIREHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker. He's wearing civvies. He stops cranking, spoons out a huge dollop into a bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIREHOUSE - TRUCK BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front seat of the pumper. Mauro tastes it. Thumbs up. Gordy smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching. To Gordy --
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be good to get you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy turns to them. Looks into the faces of these men, the people closest to him in the world. Beat. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<GORDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good to be home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son he'll never see again. But Gordy's gonna be alright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mauro's gonna be with him. There'll be fires to put out and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem see each and every day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we PULL BACK, OUT and AWAY from the old brick edifice from which the big red truck will come, bringing help...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
