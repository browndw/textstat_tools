<DIRECTION>
A modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: "1983"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked at the curb -- then turns back toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
(calls back to house)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy! I don't want you to go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
MASON STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>

Storm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her. Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve.

Storm lifts Sonny up into his arms. He gives the boy 100% of his attention, speaks just for him.

Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly -- just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him and sets him down.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMMERCIAL PIER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The limousine slowly moves up beside a stand-alone shack near the edge of the wharf. The shack is an open shelter with a broad overhang, and various kinds of equipment stored inside it. A single bulb illuminates it. The limo comes to rest, engine off, no apparent activity in or out of the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls up at a distance, deep in shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORM'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He switches OFF the RADIO, twists a telephoto night lens onto a specially silenced 8mm surveillance film camera; he primes a portable sound deck in the case he's been carrying. A quick check of the .45 in his shoulder holster, then he exits the car.

Moving carefully onto the wharf, keeping to shadow, using cover.

EXT. WHARF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stacks of huge shipping crates and Sea-Land containers from a long wall along the cluttered dock. The towering hulks of several ships loom close by. Storm finds a slot between bulk containers: a good surveillance point.

	Let's go, boys. I'm missing the Oscars.

He is less than forty yards away, looking lengthwise down the car from its rear. A beat, as Storm picks up the sound before we do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S POV - STATION WAGON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A paneled, expensive model approaches. The wagon pulls up, a short distance from the limo. A man gets out from the wagon. A beat later, the driver exits the limo. Both are armed. They check out the area, in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHACK

One man crosses under the eave of the shack -- reaches up, SMASHES the single LIGHT BULB. The spot goes dark.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the doors open on both cars. A mature man, CALABRESE, and his stocky confederate, VITALE, step from the limo. TWO other MEN -- one wearing a stylish hat, the other bareheaded -- step from the wagon. They cross to the shadowed, shack area.

Despite the shadows, it's plain the Man With The Hat is in his prime, full of vigor and impatience. Calabrese, by contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect.

Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise; he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward the line of containers.
</DIRECTION>

SHADOW MAN WITH HAT

steps forward into the light. His face comes clearly into view. Well dressed, magnetic, Bobby Kennedy-ish -- he is L.A. Assemblyman VERNON TRENT.

steps around one container (out of view of the other men) to the exact spot where Storm was. But Storm isn't there. Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. The blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's arms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his fingers. Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the big guy's hand.

They see Vitale pull up, on foot, as Storm's CAR ROARS OFF into the darkness. Vitale seems close enough to pick out the license number.

The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly spins between the Punks and behind the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL -- BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation. These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife. Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot- sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at his compadres in disbelief. He and Storm square off.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>

The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning speed at Storm's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming his forearm into the rear knee joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the leg held in Storm's arms begin to twist ... and with a blood-curdling scream we hear a LOUD SNAP.

SIRENS are heard approaching outside.

Black and whites pack the parking lot. Police ambulances make ready to haul off the three Punks. T he Counter Man, bandaged on a gurney, is wheeled out by paramedics. One medic catches Storm's eye -- flashes a gesture indicating the Counter Man will be okay.

INT. STORM'S CAR - TRAVELING - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good" PLAYS in the TAPE DECK. Storm listens for a few beats, as if letting the horn cool him out after the liquor store action. Then he ejects the tape decisively -- reaches into his camera case, pulls out the surveillance tape from tonight. He punches this tape into the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm listens. The part where the Shadow Man with the hat (Trent) says, "You'll be well compensated. Money now -- and more when I get into that office. You can take that to the bank." Storm CRANKS UP the VOLUME.

Still listening. Can't place the voice. Punches " eject," the tape pops half-out. Into the driveway, Storm activates the garage door remote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm's car stops, headlights go out. The garage door closes. Storm gets out, carrying his camera case, champagne and the big stuffed toy. He takes a couple of steps toward the door to the house, then stops, remembering -
</DIRECTION>

He leans back into the car, yanks the surveillance tape from the deck. Hands full, he tucks the tape into a inside pocket of his Versace vest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

It's late; just a courtesy lamp left on for Storm. He pulls the tapes and recorder from his case, stashes the case out of sight. He grabs a couple of champagne glasses --

Storm and Felicia forms obscure part of the screen -- standing close to each other, beside the bed. Felicia helps him off with his jacket.

Storm's hands dump his stuff onto the bedside table -- camera, tapes from case, gun. He gathers the glasses, pours champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Felicia watches her husband. She plainly loves him deeply -- and is held and excited by his contradictions. They come closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping.

	If people knew how sweet you are, they'd never be scared of you.

<DIRECTION>
Another kiss. They get their glasses out of the way, Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light. Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding her legs apart --

Not missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it -- without looking -- at the door.

The pillow strikes it, starting it swinging closed. Storm and Felicia's forms, on the bed, are eclipsed. Sound from the "CARSON SHOW" DROPS DOWN -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ANOTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN -- carrying shotguns, faces hidden by masks -- move soundlessly down a hall. A terrible alien presence within this normal American household. The men turn a corner into a different hallway --
</DIRECTION>

BEDROOM - STORM AND FELICIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their passion highly aroused now. Felicia's legs wrapped tight around Storm... their breathing, combined with the TV sound, seems like it would obscure the men's silent movement out in the hall. But:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm suddenly freezes. Listening.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
Storm lunges for his .45 on the nightstand. Suddenly LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in. Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast and smoke. In the dim light for a moment we do not know what has happened, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see one of the assassins thrown backward, jacket blown open at the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWITCH TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASSASSIN'S PARTNER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Storm hit badly at close range. He takes it in the right center mass. It looks like his right arm is torn off as his .45 is literally blown across the room. Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long -- as she is mortally wounded. We are sure Storm will collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against another, Storm has the puppet by the strings. He clamps down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for more torque. Spinning him around until he is at the peak of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's wrist and flip him violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a LOUD CRACK and scream as he lands on his head and neck, and then -- from the side, point-blank --another ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST -- Storm is blown into the air and back onto the bed from which he came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTAWAY TO:

The scene of slaughter we just left. Now in perfect stillness and quiet we HIGH ANGLE PAN DOWN the room in ...

SLOW MOTION:

Down feathers slowly float down toward the terribly sad and lifeless bodies of Storm and Felicia. Holes pepper walls; lamps obliterated; beds and pillows not even a semblance of their original form; crimson red and white smoke.

They do. Big Man collects tapes and camera from the bedside table, replacing them with large lumps of cocaine and cash. Then lie coolly places something on the night stand directly in front of the lifeless cop's face -- it is a tooth.

Little Man rifles Storm's pockets, including the Versace jacket beside the bed.

Storm's little boy stands there, in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas, holding the stuffed toy. He stares in numb horror.

LITTLE MAN (FORD)

without hesitation pumps his SHOTGUN, aims at the boy. Sonny dashes from the bedroom as the BLAST rips the door behind him!

Big Man (Dunne) boots Sonny's door open, crashes in --

SONNY'S ROOM - WINDOW

Sonny plunges out just as both men OPEN FIRE. They pound ROUND after ROUND into and through the window, blowing GLASS everywhere and ripping the windowframe and half the wall to shreds. An ALARM begins BLARING. The men glance to each other, flee.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STORM'S HOUSE - FRONT WALK - NIGHT

ALARM CONTINUING. The men emerge walking swiftly but not running, shotguns tight to their sides. They cross the street to a sedan parked in shadows. Up goes the trunk: in go shotguns, plastic bag with tapes -- and their masks, which they have just torn off.

Little Man whips behind the wheel. He is Jack Ford, an extremely bad hombre we've never seen before. He STARTS the CAR. Big Man in the passenger seat. We recognize him! He is Max Dunne -- the burly man who took Storm's phone call in the police station and passed the receiver to Karl.

side by side in the mob scene. We recognize the two Shadow Men from the wharf -- the ones who ordered Storm's murder. Under the glare of a mini-cam lamp, a female TV reporter tries to get Trent to talk.

</TRENT>

Trent's grief is so sincere, he himself almost believes it; his aides shield him from the camera, steer him away, in the direction of where O'Malley is. Holland goes the opposite way. The reporter picks up her V.O.:

Holland is clearly upset by this, but knows he can't argue with a letter from the commissioner. Reluctantly he yields. He turns his gaze back to the stretcher in the ER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now he and O'Malley are just two officers, sharing a loss.

Holland breaks his stare at Storm's body and drags away, signaling his own cops to vacate. They exit. No farewells between Holland and O'Malley. O'Malley waits silently, watching Holland and his men clear the corridor and disappear.

O'Malley's eyes flash from Storm (over whom the medics are now working) to the corridor outside, at the end of which he can see several straggling cops and news people. His mind is racing --
</DIRECTION>

He spots something on a stainless steel medical table: Storm's blood-soaked vest, apparently tossed there when the medics stripped Storm to work on him. O'Malley picks the vest up. He studies it -

Changed in seven years, softer. His shaggy hair is manicured in a sleeker, longer length and he wears a smartly short, perfectly trimmed beard. We glimpse, on Storm's chart, the identifying label: "JOHN DOE 461Z."

His hand moves! A beat ... then another. Something's happening. Another beat, and then we see him draw several sharp intake breaths, then a very deep breath. Suddenly he shudders intensely --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE - SUBLIMINAL SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm's return to consciousness. Like a disjointed dream sequence, we meld OPTICALLY DISTORTED FOOTAGE of scenes into a quick sequence depicting Storm's journey up the "tunnel" from unconsciousness and back to life:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) Storm emerging from the door of his house, the night of the Oscars. Felicia smiling, taking his arm --

INT. COMA WARD - STORM

Alone, doing paperwork, concentrating totally on her work.

A BUZZER sounds on a bank of monitoring equipment. Andy glances up; a light flashes on one screen. She studies the screen a moment, gives a perplexed look toward the ward --

INT. COMA WARD

Andy enters, scanning the area, listening. She moves down the row of patients, visually checking each. She stops at Storm and checks him, too.

Storm's eyes are closed; he's motionless.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - TRACKING STORM'S GURNEY - NIGHT

As we crash through doors WITH it. MOVING FAST. Knotted around Storm is an emergency team of doctors and nurses. A controlled chaos of AD LIB status reports and queries from them overlaps as the doors swing shut behind them.

Andy is left alone on the coma ward.

Storm back in bed. A knot of doctors finishes returning him from their emergency resuscitation work. "We'll leave him here for tonight, where they've got the full support setup." The team wraps up and begins to move off.

The TEAM LEADER instructs Andy in Storm's immediate condition and care.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

An accident case being hurried in from an ambulance. Paramedics, E.R. personnel and patients fill the scene. A bespectacled doctor in a white coat casually emerges from the crush and continues on into a hallway.

This is no doctor; it's Jack Ford, one of the killers who shotgunned Storm seven years ago!

DANNY, an aide, has Storm harnessed in a frothing whirlpool.

INT. FIRST FLOOR/MAIN DIRECTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several nurses chat and drink coffee at a clerical station. Ford comes up - nameplate, stethoscope, looking the part perfectly. We see him exchange a greeting, ask a question. One of the nurses hands him a clipboard with some papers on it. As the killer scans the clipboard -RUSS, the security man, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford averts his face subtly, continuing to study the list. Russ passes, with a greeting for the nurses -- and a (slightly unsure) nod for the killer. The killer nods back.

Danny wheels Storm through the big swinging doors. Suddenly -- he freezes.

He sees Russ's partial body in the doorway up the hall recognizable because of its security uniform trousers.

DANNY

INT. CLOSE ON STORM
</DIRECTION>

Doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter back through the swinging doors and out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative ... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
backs through the double doors at the other end of the hall, trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies she's carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full view of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly -- Ford hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy carefully heads that way -- the two corpses visible ahead and the killer poised to waste her. But she's concentrating on the overloaded tray, traveling closer ... closer ... until -- she turns off into the medicine room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT ELEVATORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to grasp the wall and push himself along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at it with the mop handle. Misses. Again. Then: bull's- eye! The light comes on!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMA WARD

Ford has found the last (Storm's) medical chart -- and the empty bed. He's heading back -- frustrated, angry out toward the hall when... the elevator BELL DINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT ELEVATORS

Storm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter, trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him as he throws a look toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - FORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stalks this way, ears tuned to the SLAPPING DOORS ahead around the corner. He breaks into a trot --

makes it all the way in with a final heave. FOOTSTEPS nearing. The doors not yet closed and --

rounds the corner just as they shut. Races forward --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUTH CORRIDOR - ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes out of the medicine room and spots blood on the floor, hurries forward -- sees Russ and Danny's bodies!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs off in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone -- finds it's been cut. Her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open -- revealing a dark, deserted seventh floor still under construction. He registers the opposing elevator rising his way -- jabbing again at the control panel ... exposed there ... doors wide open. Wild stabs. Any button will do -- just close the goddam door!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's got. The gurney wheels around and places him right next to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his gurney even farther away! He can't reach it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble strength. The doors open and --

Andy crashes into him!

Storm blinks his eyes -- groggy, disoriented. He is in bed, just waking up. Outside his window: this postcard- perfect ranch scene. Has he died and gone to heaven? He can barely absorb it: nature, sunshine, life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable. He remembers: the nurse ... Andy.

Storm braces against the cane, ready to try to stand. Andy gets up, to catch him. This infuriates Storm's pride.

He tries to get up. Andy stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey -- I don't think you get the picture here. Your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the hospital, but it's not like actually being up and bearing weight.

</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the one who doesn't get the picture. First of all, I ain't no fucking invalid! And second, I don't have time --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
He makes it upright, shaking, with a "See, I told you" look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts toward the kitchen. Andy looks very worried but doesn't try to stop him. First step -- okay. Second -- okay. Third -- blam! The cane slips and he falls flat on his face. Too weak to break the fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up. He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three, four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat again.
</DIRECTION>

Storm's face on the floor.

EXTREME CLOSEUP

Fury, frustration, despair --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake, his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode. He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins to "help" feed Storm.

INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy enters, carrying a folder, and stares in surprise. Storm has shaved and cut his hair. She obviously approves. She watches for several moments as Storm, weak but on his feet, holds on to the kitchen counter. He steps out, in wobbly balance. Not too good at first, he tries again. This time he does better, but not by much. He turns to look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy.

<STORM>

	Storm gave me his word that he is innocent of all charges preferred against him in the press -- and that he has access to indisputable proof of this. Battling the atrophy caused by seven years of hospitalization, Storm is struggling even now to regain the strength that will enable him to come forward with this evidence. He has promised me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first look at his alleged proof.

<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Clutching the cat, she strides for the door. Ford's foot slides the door shut. He and Dunne block Martha.

<FORD>

	We'll ask you again, Martha: Where is Miss Simpson?

Martha backs away -- toward a telephone.

<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm calling your superior officers to report this. I want both your names and shield numbers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the phone. Dunne's enormous hand engulfs her wrist, forces her to put the phone back in the cradle. The two cops stare at her penetratingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martha knows this is it -- life or death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hurls the cat into Ford's face; the CAT claws him, SHRIEKING. Martha knees Dunne in the balls, bolts --

Martha sprints from the door, toward the stairs, screaming.

Ford appears in the apartment doorway, his face scratched and bleeding. He aims his silencer-mounted .45 --

The front of her white uniform erupts in a bloody gush; she plunges face-first down the flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martha's crumpled form. Ford and Dunne hurry swiftly down -- pick up her body, drag it a few feet to a smackadjacent steep hillside covered with thick brush. They peer around swiftly to be sure no one has seen them, then slide the body under the brush, down the hill. In three seconds it has slithered ten feet down, out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killers take off.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm has found a zabutone meditation pillow and is sitting on his knees in formal Japanese posture with black Dugi pants and no shirt. He unravels a package with Oriental characters handwritten on the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one section: what looks like an old wax Baggie full of Chinese herbs. In the other, Storm unfolds a pouch containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny, fat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks it in deep. He then twirls and adjusts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is apparent that he knows what he's doing. We STAY CLOSE ON the needles, noting the amount in the package has greatly diminished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL UP to reveal Storm, with at least 50 needles sticking out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is now frozen deep in meditation. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND him 360 DEGREES -- he is like a Japanese statue.

A) INT. ARMSTEAD GYM - NIGHT

An impressive home facility with floor-to-ceiling mirrors, Nautilus equipment, etc. Storm ignores the machines and tentatively selects from an old set of weights, hefting them to test his own strength, then begins a slow workout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) EXT. ARMSTEAD YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm performs a series of Eastern exercises: stick, Aikido, and meditation. He's obviously pushing himself beyond exhaustion; Andy watches, growing more and more concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough! I don't care how many needles you stick in yourself or how much ginseng root you eat ... you have to sleep if you're going to recover.

Storm tries to run up a dirt hill. He's still too weak -- struggles, sweating, straining with fierce determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) INT. ARMSTEAD - GYM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm at the "sticking point" in a Scott-bench curl. His biceps bulge, veins pop as he strains with all his strength. He ... can't ... quite -- then: he Makes it! Exhausted. Lets the bar crash metal-to-metal"' into its cradle.

<DIRECTION>
Storm swims, slowly gaining power.

F) EXT. WOODED CLEARING (ARMSTEAD'S) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm with two long pieces of cut oak. As Andy watches, he lays them side-by-side on the ground and begins to dig a deep narrow hole. He tests the hole for depth. When it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension. Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy and Storm churn up the water in a splashy race. She wins but not by much. She smiles. He doesn't. She splashes water on him, but he's not in a playful mood.

EXT. WOODED CLEARING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm again approaches the Makiwara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time it is almost as if no walls can contain him nothing in his mind can represent a barrier. He has a sense of total domination before he has begun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins much harder and faster, continues driving his fist deeper and faster and harder, until even those twelve inches of solid oak are not enough for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one lightning blow the OAK SPLINTERS and flies in half. Storm walks away with a frightening calm -- stalks straight inside toward the gym...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMSTEAD GYM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is now doing some strange martial aerobic-type movements. He is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black tank top and black sweat pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS OVER TO a corner mirror and we see Andy peeking through a crack in the door. She is enjoying this immensely. She seems to be fighting her feelings, and finally she puffs up her courage. Having made some decision, she enters.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to interrupt. I, ah, well, I was just passing by and ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other in quite a different way. This time it's obvious what Andy wants, and Storm probably wants the same thing. But he tries very hard to maintain his "one objective" in life -- to get very strong and win the upcoming battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at this woman who now 'Looks more beautiful than anyone he has ever seen. Storm throws down the light weights in his hands and walks up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair back and kisses her on the mouth. She seems to explode with passion as she falls to the floor, pulling him on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll in passion growing stronger and stronger. The CAMERA PANS TO the mirror and we see Andy's feet moving in delight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYM. - STORM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone, sitting up -- bare-chested, glistening with sweat from the lovemaking. He glances across at his reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIRROR - STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing himself, just after making love. His wedding ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears in the doorway, returning from the kitchen with a tray and glasses. She wears a robe and has that mussed, after-lovemaking glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes one look at Storm and her heart sinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to him -- lowers herself gracefully to kneel beside him, setting down the tray and glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(dead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. She has a good idea what's tormenting his mind. She reaches her hand, gently touches his shoulder ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, backing slowly away from her -- seeing the pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. In frustration, he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment -- furiously venting rage! Andy flinches at the sound, the violence.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wracked with emotion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I --

(another furious punch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I still in this fucking cage?! What's wrong with my body? Why won't it heal faster?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
He slams another furious punch. Andy gets up, tries to approach Storm.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mason, please
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wants to ease his pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.

<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can't love you! Don't you see? It's seven years to anyone else. But it's only days for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Andy draws a sharp, pained breath.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I be with you ... how can I want you and take you, when --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
He can't finish, torn by guilt. He stares at Andy. Suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seduced me. You came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(defiant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no right to want me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then who does?! I've risked my life for you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who asked you to? Not me!

</STORM>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't stopped me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then don't risk it! Don't do shit for me! I don't need you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
For a second it look's like he's going to strike her. Instead he kicks the tray and GLASSES -- which smashes into the floor-to-ceiling MIRROR, SHATTERING like a bomb?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy glares at him, stalks for the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APUMSTEAD DRIVE - IRON GATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's CAR ROARS out the dirt drive past the iron gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMSTEAD BEDRROM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm stalks in, slamming the door behind him -- crosses in fury and despair to the desk. On the desktop: the news photo of Felicia, Sonny and himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm stares at the photo in agony for a moment, then rips the desk drawer open, rummages fiercely. He finds: keys!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMSTEAD GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm strides in, punches the garage door button; the door starts to open. He grabs the corner of a dusty canvas cover -- jerks it off an Army-style Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep speeds out into the night.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The Jeep parked at the edge of a cemetery road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands in the midst of the graveyard, staring at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE TOMBSTONES

In the light from the road lamp, we read the names: FELICIA STORM... MASON STORM ... JEREMY "SONNY" STORM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP - PHONE BOOTH - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethnic neighborhood, Dodger Stadium visible in b.g.

<ANDY>

No luck. Andy hangs up.

EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE STREET AND ALLEY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's car pulls past tiered hillside apartment units, enters an alley behind a row of multi-family dwellings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy at the wheel: cautious, peering around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She parks in an out-of-sight spot, TURNS OFF the ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The emotion of the parting with Mason catches up with her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a hold of yourself, Andy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She wipes her eyes, cranks the mirror around, tries to fix her face. She looks like hell.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(into mirror, sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really beautiful.

</ANDY>

She puts on shades, pulls up the hood of her sweatshirt.

EXT. TWO-FAMILY DWELLING - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy pads quickly up to a weathered wooden door, knocks. No answer. She rings the BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martha! Martha, it's me --

Andy reacts in shock and horror.

EXT. AMRSTEAD HOUSE - MORNING

Storm's Jeep enters the drive, pulls into the garage. Storm SHUTS OFF the MOTOR. As he steps to the floor, a man's silhouette MOVES INTO FRAME behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's grand theft, auto.

</O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal -- Storm looks up at his friend, too moved to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He made it to my house, the night you got shot. I hid him, played it out like he was dead -- even staged a funeral, along with Felicia's and yours. They bought it. Everyone believed he was dead.

	Where is he now? Is he safe?

Andy's car drives north, back to the Armstead house.

Ford in his car keeps a discreet distance back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - FORD'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as another car carrying three men (including Jones, the cop we remember who answered Andy's phone call from the coma ward) pulls up alongside. Ford points ahead, toward Andy's car. The new car slips in behind Ford's, tailing Andy.

INT. ARMSTEAD LIVING ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Coffee table piled with the news clippings Storm has been studying these past days.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>

	-- That night in the hospital, I found the audiotape ... in your vest. I must've listened to it a thousand times -- looking for little quirks in the voices, phrases they repeat ...

His look shows he came up with nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the tape?

<DIRECTION>
From O'Malley's briefcase comes .45 automatic, three empty clips and a box of Glazer ammo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm takes the weapon with pleasure. Checks the action, hefts it for weight. He glances at O'Malley -- two old comrades, ready to get back in action. Suddenly a bit of sadness crosses Storm's face.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, O'Mal? To you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
O'Malley begins loading the clips: grim, almost heartbroken.
</DIRECTION>
<0_MALLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was on the case, trying to find who pulled the trigger on you. But it was like swimming through shit. People kept telling me to back off. Then one morning, the phone rings. Immaculate Heart Emergency: someone ran my mother off the road, her back's broken, she's paralyzed.

He looks at Storm, tormented.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>

</O_MALLEY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did the right thing, O'Mal.
	</DIALOGUE>

Storm takes a loaded clip from his friend, slams it into the butt of the .45. He jacks the slide back and lets it slam home -- chambering a round.

INT. VESTIBULE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm poised inside the front door -- .45 in hand. In walks ... Andy!

She nearly faints at the sight of the pistol leveled between her eyes. Storm instantly jerks the weapon back. They stand there staring at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martha's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Storm takes Andy in his arms. She weeps, sobbing. Feeling all the tension and terror of the past days -- yet somehow knowing she's safe in the arms of this man she loves.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Andy ... my son's alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Andy raises her face to Storm's, her eyes welling with emotion. He kisses her. They are standing there, just inside the front door, which has a wood bottom-half and a frosted-glass top-half. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm jerks Andy sideways into the room with all his strength! He dives with her as -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TOP of the FRONT DOOR EXPLODES inward in a SHOWER of flying GLASS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three more point-blank SHOTOGUN BLASTS BLOW the rest of the DOOR to hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm hurls Andy so hard and fast it looks like she will land in pieces. He somehow ends up in front of her on the floor as a masked man plunges through the front door into the hallway, shotgun spinning to cover his advance. Too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear TWO LOUD ROUNDS and the masked man's head snaps violently back and he falls into a pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones and Ford pull masks over their faces and sprint for the other doors. Both carry assault rifles. An enormous powerful third man (Joe Bear), his mask already in place, vaults to low balcony, hauls himself up to a second story window -- his huge Bowie knife glinting in the sun.
</DIRECTION>

hurry toward a staircase, their attention focused behind them -- on the first floor.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - INTERIOR BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Bear waits concealed at the top of the stairs, on an interior balcony overlooking the living room, atrium-style. Through the mouth opening of his ski mask, we see he is smiling a sick smile -- and sensually stroking his Bowie knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - TRACKING - STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal and lunges with his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Allowing his tremendous momentum to culminate like a hurricane, Storm manipulates him in a full circle, catapulting Joe Bear unbelievably into a tall T'ang Dynasty cabinet filled with priceless Oriental artifacts!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic weapons, but before they can fire --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers! Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS!

<DIRECTION>
Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm, crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase. Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back, Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His .45 CLICKS empty!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONY - STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rips a magazine from his pocket, slams it into the butt of his .45, reloading. He has it half-raised when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ford appears -- right in his face, assault rifle leveled at Storm's guts. Storm strikes an instantaneous blow, sending the rifle flying. In one motion, he pinwheels Ford over his head, sending him flying off the exterior balcony and crashing down into the Oriental fountain below!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BALCONY AND FOUNTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm swings down to the ground. Andy leaps into his arms, he breaks her fall and helps her alight safely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches to Ford in the fountain, rips the mask off his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recognizes the man.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this fuck. He's a cop!

</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT SIDE OF HOUSE - STORM AND ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
race INTO VIEW, leap aboard the JEEP, FIRE it UP and fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MORE MASKED MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appear running down the drive -- SHOTGUN and assault RIFLE trained on Storm and Andy. They begin to FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy can't shoot and Storm can't drive and shoot at the same time, so he does what is logical for him -- he keeps the pedal to the metal and chases them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS from the two men OBLITERATE the Jeep's WINDSHIELD. BUCKSHOT RIDDLES the VEHICLE everywhere. Andy is on the floor of the Jeep. Storm is periodically ducking. He is bleeding we don't know from what or how bad -- and then blam! -- masked man #1's body is airborne. This makes #2 think... and run very fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TEAHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sprinting the 100 in 5 flat -- racing for the tea house. He makes it inside and dives for a good position to resume firing, but there isn't enough time. Storm just drives right through the front of the tea house and over the assassin's body! The JEEP ROARS out of the flattened tea house and keeps on hauling!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMSTEAD GROUNDS - JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROARS across the terrain... past the horses, ostriches, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEEP'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heavy iron gate straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAMS THROUGH the metal GATE with JEEP BLASTING it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONCOMING VEHICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Captain Holland! -- in the car as a passenger, with another plainclothes cop. The flying gate sends glass in all directions, as Storm swerves in his Jeep to avoid the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm freaks, seeing Holland as Holland's car is forced off the road. Storm SKIDS into a wild 180 --
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(gun in hand, heading back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holland! The other man on the dock --

</STORM>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy?! Get us outa here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Holland and the driver are out of their car, guns drawn. Ford races up, reinforcing them. He has an assault rifle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swerves as BULLETS SMACK into it! Protecting Andy with his body, he races off down the mountain road at high speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. O'MALLEY'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unmistakable sound of a TIRE BLOWING OUT.

<O_MALLEY>

	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Malley's car limps to the roadside, in view of a sign: "VENTURA 21." O'Malley gets out in frustration --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRINITY BOYS' PREP (VENTURA) - SOCCER FIELD - LONG LENS - SONNY STORM - (SLOW MOTION) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our first live look at Storm's son as a twelve-year-old. Wearing colorful soccer duds and TRINITY PREP athletic shirt. He looks terrific, like a young colt -- free and fearless -- his shiny hair flying as lie runs down a soccer ball in the pell-mell action of an eighth-grade game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The feel of this SLOW MOTION portrait is diametrically opposite to the corruption and duplicity in the world of the movie so far. In contrast, Sonny's world seems pure and unsullied -- youthful and untouched by the harsh realities of the world. We watch Sonny and his teammates long enough to absorb his vigorous,full-of-life energy. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK FOCUS TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX DUNNE AND NOLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Striding swiftly. Toward Sonny. Their dark plainclothes suits in grim contrast to the colorful soccer uniforms --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY (SLOW MOTION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls! The rush of soccer action sweeps past him, down the field. Sonny -- all attention focused on the game -- scrambles to his feet, legs churning to take off in pursuit of his friends. Just as he gets his traction:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX DUNNE (NORMAL SPEED)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of nowhere scoops Sonny up in his brawny, brutal arms! Sonny cries out and tries to resist, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNFIELD - SOCCER PLAYERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They don't hear, lost in their own action and cheering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunne and Nolan hustle him swiftly toward their car. Already they're well away from the field, moving fast
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNFIELD SIDELINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soccer coach turns back. We see him shout, his arm raised in a gesture of urgency --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNFIELD - SOCCER PLAYERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn back, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG ANGLE - SONNY, DUNNE AND NOLAN

Into Dunne's car. The car speeds off.

EXT. STORM'S OLD HOUSE - POV THROUGH JEEP WINDSHIELD - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the house whips INT0 VIEW and the JEEP BRAKES HARD to stop. This is the house from the film's opening -- the one Storm, Felicia and Sonny lived in seven years ago. It is undergoing a remodeling now. Carpenter's and plasterers' trucks in the driveway --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEEP - ACROSS STREET - STORM AND ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm yanks up the brake, full of urgency -- pulls out his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just made the top of the chart, Andy. Every cop in the city thinks we shot our way out of a legitimate bust --

</STORM>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no cops here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only 'cause they're too stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cocks the slide, ready to go)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need that film and we don't need any bullshit --

</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - FRONT WALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy making Storm put the gun away.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamit ... for once, do something the non-violent way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Storm is reacting to the sight of his old home -- the first time he's seen it since the slaughter seven years ago. He struggles with his pain and rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy, aware of his turmoil, takes his hand. Her hair is done up in a businesslike style; she wears a jacket and carries a briefcase. They cross to the front door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pleasant, chatty (and very pregnant) HOUSEWIFE speaks through the open door to Storm and Andy. Sounds of HAMMERING, ETC. in other rooms O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSEWIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Gee, my husband and I aren't really thinking about selling. In fact, we're adding a nursery --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOUSEWIFE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's the best time for us to see it! Then when you do come to sell, our office will know the upgrades you've made and we can market your home more effectively.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Two plasterers troop past, a carpenter with them.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSEWIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, come on in. Everyone else does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOUSEWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
Storm and Andy enter. Andy immediately begins to steer the Housewife away from the kitchen, into the living room. "Oh what a cute place!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I'd love to see what you're doing with the nursery..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm casually lingers behind, drifting into the kitchen. He crosses immediately to the alcove where, seven years earlier, he stashed the camera case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the spot has been remodeled! There's a new wall there!
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New wall ... fucking yuppies!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Without hesitation, he slams his fist through --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from the blow as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOUSEWIFE AND ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
arrive from the living room. The Housewife stares in shock at this strange man -- with his hand halfway through her new wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSEWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
(very cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just checking for termites He tucks the camera case under his arm -- takes Andy by the elbow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOUSEWIFE>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Housewife)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better have this place fumigated -- quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Andy out -- crisply, businesslike. Housewife stands there dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS FROM CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm pauses in mid-conversation, drops the phone receiver from his ear. Thinking fast, troubled. Andy beside him... both of them keeping their faces obscured as moviegoers and business people pass.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Andy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O'Malley left his mother's place three hours ago -- with the tape. He should be at the school by now, but she hasn't heard back from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Several people pass, glancing curiously at Storm. He averts his face, getting even more antsy. The camera case under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: people staring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck the tape. We gotta get this film to Esposito or I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Storm knows this, too -- puts the receiver back to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. O'Malley. Sorry ... listen. We're outside the Century Plaza now ... the hotel. Right, right. The one in Century City. Okay, listen closely ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(makes this very clear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell O'Mal to leave a message for us at the hotel desk. Leave it for Andy ... Andrea Smith. We're not gonna check in, it's too dangerous -- but the desk will hold the message if you tell them we're coming in this afternoon. Got it? Great. You're a champ, Mrs. '0.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Storm hangs up, peering around uneasily -- takes Andy by the elbow...
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna call Esposito. But not from this phone.

</STORM>

Storm and Andy hurry off.

MONTAGE

WITH SCORE. Tension, urgency increasing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) INT. REDONDO BEACH RETIREMENT - VILLA - OFFICE -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. O'Malley hangs up her phone, finishes scribbling the notes she took from Storm. CAMERA MOVES IN ON the office window. THROUGH the window, outside DOWN the block, we see ... a nondescript sedan --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) EXT. STREET OUTSIDE RETIREMENT VILLA - SEDAN - DAY

Two men inside. One wears earphones. He takes them off -- shoots a look of satisfaction to the other man.

O'Malley hurrying from his car in the lot toward the school's main administration building.

A priest and the soccer coach hurry from the building, toward O'Malley.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) INT. JEEP - MOVING - ANGLE ON STORM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Scowling, as a car passes and its occupants seem to stare at the Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) EXT. SILVER LAKE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm's JEEP BRAKES HARD at a stoplight, next to four bad- looking LATINO YOUTHS in a ragged Camaro. The dudes check Andy out lasciviously.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hermano! You want this Jeep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the keys from the ignition, holds them up.

<YOUTH_1>

	How hot is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_1>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' smoking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
The youths look to each other. Then to the piece of shit they're driving. In their heads, they've already got the Jeep stripped, repainted, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got it, my man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_1>

<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE ENDS, MUSIC DOWN --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. L.A. ZOO - PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Storm's Camaro parked discreetly. Storm gets out -- wary, camera case on a strap from his shoulder. Kids and moms, other zoo-goers coming and going.

Andy moves uneasily behind the wheel.

Storm adjusts his jacket to conceal his .45. Peering around. He passes the camera case back in to Andy.

	Don't worry. I'm a big boy.

EXT. ANOTHER ZOO WALKWAY - STO'RIM

The TV reporter we remember from earlier in the film, the one Storm is now going to meet. He stands nervously outside, smoking. We hear one of the great APES BELLOW -

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ESPOSITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Max Dunne moves INTO FRAME seizing Esposito -- subtly, not drawing any attention. Another man in a suit reinforces Dunne from the other side. Esposito shows terror, but no surprise. Clearly the men have had the drop on him for several minutes -- but there was nothing he could do about it. Dunne's posture indicates he has a concealed gun pressed to Esposito's ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunne and Storm make eye contact. The message is clear: Try anything and Esposito dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Dunne and the other man hustle Esposito from the plaza --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SECURITY-TYPE IN SUIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves into Storm's peripheral vision. Coat over his arm, concealing a short-barreled automatic weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_TYPE>

	Someone wants to talk to you, Storm.

The man gestures with his coat arm. Storm's eyes follow to:

STORM'S POV - PARK BENCH - TRENT

The Senator himself. Big, as life and cool as a cucumber. Alone and unrecognized on a bench, shelling and munching from a bag of peanuts. Behind him: a caged vulture.

After a beat ... Storm sits.

<TRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do have the film somewhere, I assume?

Like lightning, Storm lunges for Trent... whips behind him, seizing his throat and hauling Trent's body into the line of fire -- as a shield protecting Storm!

INT. POWER PLANT - EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A mesh-enclosed space above the main dynamo room. Deafening DIN of TURBINE GENERATORS below. A bulb illuminates Sonny sitting rigidly on a metal chair. Nolan, a cop we saw earlier in the film, and TURNER (whom we haven't seen before) play cards, making sure Sonny goes nowhere.

Sonny scoots to the windows, which are cracked open awning style. He peers out and down.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cab pulls into the curb outside Mrs. O'Malley's place, Sonny springs out. We see the cabbie shouting after him -- and Sonny arguing, gesturing toward the nursing home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. O'Malley emerges from the nursing home wheelchair. Sonny rushes to her ... they embrace joyfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Malley comes out too, more cautiously than his mother. He is armed. He also hurries to Sonny, hugs him tight.

Storm wheels the car at high speed -- super-intense, clutching a tiny chain-link "low-rider" steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>

Jones takes the message slip. Ford and one of the plainclothesmen join him -- the three move aside, confer briefly. Ford and the cop move off. Jones crosses back to the Desk Clerk, hands the message slip back to him.

Storm drops away from Andy, about ten feet from the desk, slips subtly toward an alcove.

Andy crosses to the desk -- we see her speak to the Clerk and the Clerk hands her the message slip. She scans it hastily, excited by what she reads -- moves quickly back to Storm.

	Sonny got away! He's with O'Malley! O'Malley's gat the tape -- they're heading for Union Station.

STORM

shields Andy. Plainclothesman #1 steps out, whipping out his badge. Suddenly Storm grabs the cop with the badge in front of his face and uses him as a human battering ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental office and out into the street in front of the hotel! Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream. Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

Storm dumps his "battering ram body" and he and Andy sprint toward the valet booth at the main entrance of the hotel, where numerous cars are coining and going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALET AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume. He is presently handing keys to a large "good old boy" -- boots, ten-gallon hat and all. Tex is just laying a bill in the Beefeater's hand, and starting to stuff his too- large frame into a sleek Gullwing speedster with its doors popped up. Before he can, we see him take a flying seat on the road as Storm and Andy shove in and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AVENUE OF THE STARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly the Gullwing is in flight -- SCREECHING away from the hotel entrance, across the median and the decorative fountain that separates the Avenue of the Stars. But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping. As the two cop cars crash into each other --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORD AND JONES

on foot, catch up to the scene. Too late.
</DIRECTION>
<FORD>
	<DIALOGUE>

0'Malley scans the monitor above the ticket seller's window. The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waiting area is quiet at this time of night except for a few travelers and stragglers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on top of a battered suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny on a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>

	Be careful you don't get any of that guck on your sweater ... let me comb your hair before your old man gets here, it's stinking up in the back.

O'Malley takes a comb out of his jacket pocket.

Nevertheless O'Malley tries to comb Sonny's hair. Sonny pushes the comb aside.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>

Just then, O'Malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the air. A foreign presence. Nolan, and Turner have followed him and Sonny from Mrs. O'Malley's house. Now they approach --
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see.

<DIRECTION>
(approaching)

	Taking a trip somewhere?

</NOLAN>

O'Malley slip the tape from his pocket, placing it under Sonny's Jacket on the bench without missing a beat, as he calmly starts to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>

(to Sonny, under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure your father gets this ...

(to Nolan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Me and my son are visiting my mother in New Mexico.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
O'Malley gets up, starts to move toward the men.
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son, huh? That's funny. He doesn't look much like you --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his partner)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he, Turner?

</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<TURNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks a lot like Mason Storm.

</TURNER>
<DIRECTION>
O'Malley and the men come to face-off point, staring at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough of this fucking around. We want the tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
CLUNK! O.S. we hear a CLATTERING ECHO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny has picked up his jacket. The tape has fallen onto the marble floor!
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonny -- run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny snatches up the tape and leaps over the bench, racing toward the rear doorway heading for the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nolan and Turner start to run after him. O'Malley throws a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing into a big, loaded luggage cart. O'Malley finds his feet first as all three struggle to get up. Nolan starts to pull his gun. O'Malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase and smashes Nolan in the face with all his strength. Nolan crashes backward against Turner, toppling them both into a huge 25-foot lighting installer's ladder -- which now starts -- to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of big industrial GLOBES plummeting to the floor and EXPLODING into thousands of tiny shards! People scream. O'Malley shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny has made his way into the parking area, amidst dozens of cars, but he has stopped -- looking back fearfully, worried about O'Malley. O'Malley bursts from the exit.

<O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Sonny -- get outta here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the station, a cab is jacked up; the driver replacing a flat. O'Malley starts to run toward Sonny past the cab, when suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is SHOT in the back by Nolan! His lurching bulk crashes into cab, knocking it off its jack to the ground. The tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose, onto the ground near O'Malley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cab driver flees for his life. O'Malley spins back, draws and tries to fire at the oncoming Nolan and Turner -- but he is SHOT TWICE in the stomach. Turner kicks O'Malley in the hand, sending the gun flying off under the cab!
</DIRECTION>
<NOLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the kid! He's under the cars!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nolan and Turner sprint off after Sonny. Sonny rolls from under one to another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nolan and Turner try to trap him, peering under the cars -- but Sonny is too agile and cat-like. Turner crouches down, spots Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<TURNER>

</TURNER>
<SONNY>

</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Turner aims his gun. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head turns to squash as: a bloody O'Malley stands over him, bashing him with a tire iron!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd of bystanders scream in horror at this horrendous sight.

Nolan comes around the end of the car, sees O'Malley -- standing over the dead Turner with a tire iron in his hand. It is clear O'Malley is about to die. But still he staggers toward Nolan, raising the tire iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nolan, gun in hand, watches incredulously. O'Malley staggers another step. Sonny has crawled out from under the car; he sees this. O'Malley staggers another step.
</DIRECTION>
<O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nolan, dying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't deserve to wear your badge. with his last failing strength, O'Malley raises the tire iron. Nolan PUMPS him once, square in the chest, killing him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_MALLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Sonny screams and flees in fear for his life. Nolan races after him. Between the maze of parked cars. Sonny, dodging, in between the endless rows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile a small crowd has gathered around the mortally wounded O'Malley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, O.S. we hear the SCREECHING of TIRES. The crowd reacts as the Gullwing blasts into the lot, ROARING straight toward Nolan and the terrorized Sonny. Finally, unable to get any closer, Storm leaps out of the Gullwing, onto the hood of a car and races across the rooftops of one vehicle after another, closing in on Nolan and Sonny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken O'Malley.

<DIRECTION>
unaware of Storm -- trying to escape from his pursuer.

NOLAN

cursing and unable to gain ground on the fleet-footed -- now actually raising his gun. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from the roof of the next-to-last car roof in a line of parked vehicles soars through the air like a night eagle- setting what looks like a new world record in the long jump -- surprising Nolan from the rear! Slamming the cop to the ground in instant death. Cracking his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops. Gasping, breathless -- seeing the father he hasn't seen in seven years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. They hold each other with all their strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However their moment is incomplete, as Sonny is visibly distraught about the stricken O'Malley, beginning to sob at the loss of his surrogate father. Storm turns and starts to move toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'MALLEY - ON GROUND

Holland grabs his shoulder holster off the back of a chair, stalks angrily toward a rear door.

The others glower as Holland pounds off into the rear of the house. Dunne slings a cue ball the length of the table, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot.
</DIRECTION>

The balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in a futile expression of rage and frustration. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Holland just left by. He is dripping from the rain and has a .45 pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he holds a finger to his lips as if to say, "Shhh, don't wake the baby."

Glances from the men toward the couch at the rear of the room, on which rest their jackets and shoulder holsters. Storm: totally aware of every aspect of the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you guys are thinking. You're thinking I couldn't play with this gun in my hand. Right?

Pause as the men stand in extreme anticipation. Then: Storm holsters his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well? Somebody hand me a cue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
There is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of disbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries to hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball and the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the pool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes toward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool -- and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table. Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's midsection. With the other hand he raises the sharpened end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat via the windpipe!
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>

	That's for my wife. Fuck you and die.

Holland as he moves toward the sporting room and his support team. He enters the area of carnage and the smug confidence on his face starts to change to a slight worry. He then starts carefully making his way back to the indoor pool to inform Trent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDOOR POOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holland enters the area and finds no one. Now the look on his face is one of fear and confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonofabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLLAND>
<DIRECTION>
But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking has turned into panicked blundering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does it feel to know you're about to die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his .45 pointed at Holland.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again. As he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALL BEHIND HOLLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's head. They are both out of ammo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide and seek with a childhood friend.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet seat, and then proceeds into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(loud enough
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	for Trent to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
hear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see ... where could that bad boy be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or what. He approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MASTER CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside -- looking for something that's probably not there. Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the Bahamas by now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section. Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM AND TRENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent and flips him backwards head-first into the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm turns away --
</DIRECTION>
<FADE_OUT>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are not sure where we are yet. In the distance, we see a procession of marching men, all wearing kilts, and all the accoutrements of traditional Scottish garb. In the front, several paces ahead of the neatly marching lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER. Behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by mounted police.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET begins playing "Taps." The coffin is slowly lowered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with subtitles including each speaker's name to make every word and identity clear. We see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The "pushed" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland. We see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENT>
<DIRECTION>
Our SHOT starts to WIDEN, revealing that the TV monitor is in a news studio. The nightly news is being broadcast: what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out over the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES, we begin to see the actual news set -- including Esposito who got his well- deserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople, crewmen, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<CALABRESE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well, the next time I read about him, it better be in the obituaries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRENT>
<DIRECTION>
CONTINUE MOVE as the wharf scene keeps playing. The TV monitor passes OUT OF FRAME, SOUND goes DOWN, we're MOVING PAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to go back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on UP TOWARD --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding. The screen starts to bleach out ... it goes white and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT - SUN (MARINA DEL REY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
above a perfect peaceful sea. A small powerboat (the kind that you rent from the dock) moves INTO FRAME. Storm steers it, standing up. Andy and Sonny in the back cockpit seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN ANDY'S LAP - PORTABLE TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She switches a channel: up comes the same footage we just saw on the news set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a beat before she realizes what it is. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey ... Seven year Storm!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you you'd be famous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Storm takes a step so he can see the screen. Views it for a short beat, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
picks the TV up from Andy's lap and, while it's still playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OCEAN SURFACE - TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
splashes ... bobs for a few moments... then sinks beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Why'd you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching the last ripples from the sinking set. A moment between him and himself -- when the past is allowed to slip away, sink out of sight, making way for the future.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and to the woman he loves. He sits (letting the boat drift wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him with a playful headlock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension, wondering what Storm will do or say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sonny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock, knock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
For a beat, the boy is taken aback. Then he break's into a broad smile.
</DIRECTION>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<DIRECTION>
Storm glances to Andy, pulling her tighter to him.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<SONNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boo who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SONNY>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to cry about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Storm hugs his son with great affection, pulling Andy to him with his other arm. This is their beginning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drifts its happy way across the sun-shimmering sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
