EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAHAM DALTON, twenty-nine, drives his '69 Cutlass while smoking a cigarette. One could describe his appearance as punk/arty, but neither would do him justice. He is a man of obvious intelligence, and his face is amiable. There is only one key on his keyring, and it is in the ignition.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Garbage. I started thinking about what happens to all the garbage. I mean, where do we put all of it, we have to run out of places to put it eventually, don't we? This happened to me before when that barge with all the garbage was stranded and nobody would take it? Remember that?

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANN BISHOP MILLANEY, twenty-six, sits opposite her therapist. She is an extremely attractive woman, dressed in a mature preppy style. There is a wedding ring on her left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ann, do you see a pattern here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.

<DIRECTION>
JOHN MILLANEY, twenty-nine, sits at his desk talking on the telephone. He is dressed very well, sporting real suspenders with his striped pinpoint oxford shirt and cotton suit. He fingers the wedding ring on his left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As soon as you've got a ring on your finger, you start getting serious attention from the opposite gender. Seriously, I wish I had Super Bowl seats for every time I had some filly just come up and start talking to me without the slightest provocation. That never happened before I got married. Shit, if I'd known that, I'd have gone out and bought me a ring when I was eighteen and saved myself a lot of time and money.

</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.

	What upsets you about that?

<ANN>

	I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.

INT. CYNTHIA BISHOP'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CYNTHIA BISHOP, Ann's SISTER, opens her door to reveal the freshly coifed John Millaney. They kiss passionately and begin to disrobe. Cynthia bears a slight resemblance to Ann, but is not as overtly attractive. She does, however, have a definite carnal appeal and air of confidence that Ann lacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you begin having this feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over, to Ann)

	Oh, yeah.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I m curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.

</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
John and Cynthia are now having sex.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(voice over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?

Graham has parked in the Millaney's driveway. He opens the trunk, revealing a Sony 8mm Video rig and a single black duffle bag. He grabs the duffle bag and shuts the trunk.
</DIRECTION>

Graham knocks at the door. He is stubbing out a cigarette with his beaten tennis shoe when Ann answers the door. She is unable to hide her suprise at his appearance.

Graham sits, his manner pleasantly animated. He gets his Gitanes from inside his scuffed black leather jacket and looks around for an ashtray. Ann swallows uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no problem. It can wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of silence. Graham looks at Ann directly. It is not a challenging stare, he's just trying to ascertain what kind of person she is. Ann, to her credit, somehow meets his gaze. Something subtle passes between them.

	Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.

<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not really.

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You play an instrument?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really .... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(caught slightly off guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I like it. I like it very much.

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well.....well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Ann looks at Graham and stops. He smiles again.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...free-lance. You know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(if you have one).
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ann is fascinated, if a bit overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean like "time flies"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long has it been since you've seen John?

</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine years?

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Didn't you know him well?
	</DIALOGUE>

A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you drop out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were...very much alike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>

Graham gets up and heads for the toilet. Ann watches him go, a bemused smile on her face. After she hears the door close, she can't resist the impulse to take a closer look at Graham's bag.

<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

</ANN>
<JOHN>

	Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were prying before?

Ann's smile fades. John resumes eating.

<ANN>

Graham eats in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Graham)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham thinks a moment, then puts his keyring with its single key onto the table.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, see, right now I have this one key, and I really like that. Everything I own is in my car. If I get an apartment, that's two keys. If I get a job, maybe I have to open and close once in awhile, that's more keys. Or I buy some stuff and I m worried about getting ripped off, so I get some locks, and that's more keys. I just really like having the one key. It's clean, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.

</JOHN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like having the car, the car is important.

<JOHN>

Graham also stands, empty plate in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Everyone but Ann is asleep. She gets up from her bed and sneaks quietly into the guest bedroom where Graham is staying. She walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he sleeps. Moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully. Exhaling, he turns over slowly, his back to Ann.
</DIRECTION>

She picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels the surface. She brings the jacket to her nose, inhaling his presence. She then sets the jacket down.

<DIRECTION>
Graham and Ann are having lunch. Ann looks to have had a lot of wine. Graham drinks club soda with a twist.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard to explain. It's like... John treats everybody the same, you know? I mean, he acts just as excited about seeing somebody he hardly knows as he does when he sees me. And so I feel like, what's different about me, if I'm treated exactly the same as some acquaintance? If I don't like somebody, I don't act like I do. I guess that's why a lot of people think I'm a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a sip of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?

Ann smiles.

	Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I think...I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I'm getting confused.

<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.

	Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.

	Why is that?

	Do you want me to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(exhales)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...are you self-conscious about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self-conscious person I've ever seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.

<GRAHAM>

	Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't believe in therapy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.

	Well, my therapist knows me intimately.

I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different.

	What do you mean? I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?

INT. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a television monitor we see images originating from an 8mm Video deck. Graham sits naked in a sheet-covered chair facing the screen. He watches the tape, which is footage of himself interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences. The photography on the tape is handheld, relentless. As the questions get more detailed, Graham becomes more aroused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock on Graham's door. He calmly shuts off the videotape player and stands, wrapping the sheet around himself.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's open.

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheaper that way. And cuts down on the clutter.

</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ann walks to the table where the video gear is set up. Graham watches her closely. She looks into a large box of 8mm videotapes. On the side of each tape is a label. The labels look like this:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DONNA / 11 DEC 86 / 1:07:36

	I was...eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?

	<DIALOGUE>
	How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?

</GRAHAM>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.

</CYNTHIA>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you disappointed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.

	Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.

	My sister, for one. Is that who it is?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that supposed to comfort me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<JOHN>

	I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.

INT. JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann, dressed in some of John's work clothes (old cotton shirt, khaki pants) is cleaning the house. Not cleaning like a normal person, but like an obsessive/compulsive person. Scrubbing spots that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over and over, etc. Suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise. Shutting the machine off, Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthia's diamond stud earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann stares at Cynthia's earring for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having sex with John. The earring slips out of the pocket and bounces under the edge of the bed.

<DIRECTION>
Ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins to pound it with the bottom of a water glass, trying to smash it to pieces. She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a diamond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann looks down at herself. Suddenly realizing that she is dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and pants from her body as though the material were burning her skin. Popped buttons skid across the floor.

Clothed only in her bra and underwear, Ann sits in the middle of the bedroom floor, arms around herself.

	It's open!

</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. Graham gets up and opens the door himself. Ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her breathing deliberate. Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead her inside. Impulsively, she hugs him tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly at his side. Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits down. Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of water. He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. Ann holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The previous afternoon. We are no longer looking at Ann on the monitor, but watching her and Graham AS THEY MADE THE TAPE. For instance, we can now see Graham from Ann's point of view, or the two of them at the same time, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you weren't always impotent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you have had sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was the last person you had sex with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her name was Elizabeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem was me. I was...I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you lied to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non-verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now you can?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you get lonely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her...eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Subtlety?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you feel the same way with John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of...craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting analogy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I m so mad at him!!

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so...deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!

<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not in love with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I can't answer that precisely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very flattering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.

</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've told you.

</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't understand--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig--

	I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you're still in contact with her?

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're planning to be?

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Possibly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not entirely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like maybe a big part?

</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Possibly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(has to laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham says nothing. Ann looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, Graham, this is so...pathetic. You're not even what you pretend to be, you're a lie, you're a bigger lie than you ever were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham sets the camera down, though it continues to record. He is visibly upset.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
<DIRECTION>
(heated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Ann moves in closer, burrowing, her eyes on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you. You have wasted nine years. I mean, that has to be some sort of weird record or something, nine years. How does that feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham says nothing. Ann picks up the camera and points it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham reaches up for the camera. Ann knocks his hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not until I get some answers. Tell what you feel. Not what you think, I've heard plenty of that. What you feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham is on the verge of completely falling apart.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Graham regains his composure somewhat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you ashamed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not answering me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(heated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know why you are the way you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind...the way my brain works...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
[frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you re...inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much...there's no protection. And...somebody could say, or do something to you while you re in this...state of...nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Ann)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the camera down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves in front of Graham and kneels.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to touch you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to touch you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ann reaches out, and Graham instinctively begins to move away.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graham.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Something in her voice makes him stop. Their eyes lock. Graham slowly moves back toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann's hand eases out to him, her eyes still burning into his. Graham closes his eyes, accepting Ann's touch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She caresses him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delicately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She touches his arms, his face, his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to lie him back on the couch. When he offers light resistance, she gently persists.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your eyes closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
Graham lies back, silently obeying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann touches his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to unbutton his shirt. She watches his face, hoping that he will remain calm. He does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rubs her hand on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face. She moves his hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon each hand is exploring the other. Fingers search for and find hidden areas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed. Ann moves onto the couch with Graham.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest. They move forward and back, like a lazy tide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Graham. His face is tranquil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching his features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him. She waits for a negative reaction. Getting none, she moves lower and kisses his eyes. Still receiving no discouragement, she moves to his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A subtle movement from Graham. Ann waits for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have reached her neck. He slowly pulls his face to hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes more passionate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Graham seems about to evaporate in a state of ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which continues to record.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Ann's embrace. Reality slowly envelopes him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graham...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<GRAHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ann reaches for his hand. He allows her to take it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
(almost dazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Graham looks at Ann for a long moment. She sees the acceptance and gratitude in his eyes. She smiles lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham moves forward and shuts off the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John watching the tape. There is video snow on the monitor now. The tape timer reads 46:02. John gets up slowly, ejects the tape from the player, and heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graham, hearing the footsteps approach, backs away from the inlet. His eye is swollen, and he holds one of his hands in a curious position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John opens the door. He looks at Graham for a moment before reaching into his pocket for Graham's keys. He dangles them in his hand as he stands over Graham.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never told you this, because I thought it would crush you, but now I could give a shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fucked Elizabeth. Before you broke up. Before you were having trouble, even. So you can stop making her into a saint. She was good in bed and she could keep a secret. And that's about all I can say about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John drops Graham's keys to the floor and leaves. Graham stands, fighting back tears, and walks into his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls Ann's tape from the videotape player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape itself out, ruining it forever. He does the same to every other tape in both the boxes. Calmly. Deliberately. Methodically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of videotape behind him. He breaks the lens off the camera body, and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table. He then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape, where it disappears.
