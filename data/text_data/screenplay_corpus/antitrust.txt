Milo sits on a bench. He tries not to look, but his childhood hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face.

Gary heads back, carrying something spherical.

<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's more to life than computers? I'm looking into it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks vaguely afflicted. He mutters:
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Once I start looking into something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, detailed metal object: model satellite.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Milo takes it, carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.

</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Low enough to relay internet traffic.

<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles: exactly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips his own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?

<DIRECTION>
As they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary seems to read his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what people say, and not just the Justice Department. We clone ideas, inflict our second-rate versions on the world, we haven't done anything original since 1.0.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Milo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put some of our apps up against anybody's. But is there some truth to it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo watches Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --

A block of floodlit "tract mansions," Taco Bell palaces of the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is parked nearby. Milo is excited.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not just Gary that makes you wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big place. You might not even see him again.

A brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>

	Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.

</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
The rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV, the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the Justice Department.

<DIRECTION>
(gives Barton the water)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about the glass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ, Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTON>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... What's that mean again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BARTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.

She kisses him. They head out. We linger. On TV a graphic says: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: MASS SUICIDE - LIVE. Emergency Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new Mediterranean mansion. Footage shows bodies (including a few children) on bunkbeds, uniformly shod in black Nikes.

The Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A Teacher leads her little charges inside.

	Gary's put millions in there. And the people with kids? They're not hotshot geeks, they're just payroll clerks or whatever.

Two Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations.
</DIRECTION>
<REDMOND>

	Everybody has the same office, there's no dumbass corporate hierarchy.

He bows deep, with mock-obeisance. Milo blushes, Redmond laughs, he snags Milo's elbow. They walk again, passing a service hall with a Civil Defense sign.

ANOTHER HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

Up the hall, a young woman (LISA) is about to go into her office. She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in. She's beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<REDMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDMOND>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<REDMOND>

	Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.

</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seems a little -- tense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<REDMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Geeks pull his chain cause he's non- tech. Ex-cop or something. They moon cameras, or use ATM's as swipe cards. The cameras're our real security so he's a little demoralized.

Blond wood, smoked glass -- a room as sleek as the Geeks who lunch here are nerdy. Milo and Redmond push trays.

Lisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo. At a table, Randy and Phil note the "interaction." Meantime:
</DIRECTION>
<REDMOND>

Milo's grinning as he takes in the house.

THE BEDROOM - MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Windows give onto a garden with a small studio. Milo's still beaming, Alice is pleased. Till he says:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo! What about --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures at what she hopes will be their home.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, It's great. It's great!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Think I should tell him I learned everything using 1.0? Maybe I could show him one of my early programs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls him back into the kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE W/ MUSIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1.) MILO types intently in his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled on it. Gary seems touched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is reading from a document:
</DIRECTION>
<DOJ_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Infotek's urgent need to license Outpost Office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you wrote the word "tool," what'd you mean by it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOJ_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DOJ_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What d'you think you meant by it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOJ_AGENT>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm confused. Am I supposed to speculate under oath?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, while offering nothing).
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since you didn't have an answer to that question, Mr. Boyd --
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHER_AGENT>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
("confused" again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't remember."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to hide his annoyance:
</DIRECTION>
<DOJ_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOJ_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your protege's moving so fast we can barely keep up with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is good. Who did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.

	Maybe we should all get on it.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'm going too fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply; incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even when I had a hand in every aspect of the company I knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more engrossing than Skywire?)
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching into his pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did this -- overnight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making me young again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled, smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWS_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...A graduate of MIT, he was on the antidepressant Prozac, and had been warned not to drink and drive.

Lisa watches the news report, knowingly.

Milo's typing.

He looks. He stands.

	Lisa.

</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know my name.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're famous around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(winces)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Something like that. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to jolt her. She pales a little. What a mysterious girl. But this only adds to her allure.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I say something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to wish that. All the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
They're looking at each other: he gets self-conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the CD-ROM)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What've you got there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
They sit. As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking at her. On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the logo appears. It's struck by a bolt from the sky. The outpost comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its windows, a ringing phone. Finally, the word SKYWIRE burns into it. It's neat, she's really good.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Simultaneously, they reach for the mouse. Their hands touch. They look at each other. Something happened.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Sh-Show me the next one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, manipulates the mouse. He stares at the screen strenuously, fighting the impulse to stare at Lisa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANTEROOM - GARY'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary's SECRETARY types as Milo enters. She smiles at him.

<SECRETARY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary's face is red. The two Lawyers who sat in on his deposition are with him again.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we bundled it, the judge is threatening to enjoin the whole --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm confused, Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter 12 by the time they could hope to enjoin? I'm very confused, because you said they'd be ready to settle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo hears Gary yelling behind the closed door. It's indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit!" Milo flips through a copy of Wired, trying to ignore it. The Lawyers come out, passing swiftly, rather grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(when Milo looks dubious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's always happy to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, pens, etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open doorframe.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo. What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- you sent for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives it to Milo. Once again, Milo marvels.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really wrote this just today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(dark, unsmiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you implying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(knits his brow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Milo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide his discomfort. Gary watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It scales, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely.

He smiles. For the first time it looks forced.

INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse. Alice looks great. The Waiter pours wine.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>

	This feels fairly grown up, I'd say.

Milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass.

	That's what I need to ask you.

(when he says nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you can't keep anything from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She just looks at him. He grows a little defensive:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(just confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.

He looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches.

	I'm so stupid.

He throws the roll back into the basket.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that -- extreme?

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.

We see the rolls: covered in seeds.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --

</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
	</DIALOGUE>

He smiles. But his heart's not in it. She hates to see him suffer. She picks up her glass.

Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot) give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be having been found in bed with a girl.

<BRIAN>

</PHIL>
<GARY>

Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary.

EXT. BUILDING #20 PARKING LOT - EVENING

Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems to be -- apologizing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is waiting for him. She's white.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What's wrong?

</MILO>

She doesn't know how to say it.

A mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have gathered. In the BG, Teddy's Dad weeps volubly.

INT. TEDDY'S WORKSPACE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit, peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<NELSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They trashed his hard disk, all his back-ups. Nothing's left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELSON>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They caught the guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin- headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's.
</DIRECTION>
<NELSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an airtight case. They found the weapon with Teddy's blood on it and their fingerprints. They'd been arrested twice for beating-up Asians. How come they weren't in jail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELSON>
<DIRECTION>
Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me about the break-in. He didn't seem to take it that seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<NELSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys don't take anything seriously do you? That's not on a hard drive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELSON>
<DIRECTION>
Milo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's time to go to scatter the ashes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know he was working with fiber optics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>

But when he looks up, Nelson's gone.

As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the filament in his suit pocket.

EXT. BLUFF OVER THE PACIFIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's Prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUFF - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LARRY>

	You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I don't miss you.

<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just thought his work should go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LARRY>

	He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?

</LARRY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.

	Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.

</LARRY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those really weird, short lines.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

As Milo comes up the hall, Lisa is standing there. We get the feeling she's been waiting for him.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, perhaps hearing Teddy's words ("what're the chances?"). He nods, moves on. She watches him head up the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo types. There is a rapping on the doorframe. Gary.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were the flags for Teddy?

</MILO>

Gary nods. Spontaneously Milo stands, hugs Gary.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had you talked to him much lately?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.

Milo eats alone. Through the window, he sees Lisa inside. She's eating alone, too. Gary comes trotting up.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of like -- Teddy's.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(an uncertain smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wrong place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the very ground is going out from under him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the words Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling, saying "See you later." And he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo? You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
It strikes him she always shows up at these moments. He gathers his wits before looking up.

	Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something.

</MILO>

INT./EXT. MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded on the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws it down like it's contaminated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children. Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle.

EXT. INT./FRONT DOOR/FOYER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
He fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>

	Alice? Alice!

</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window, painting in the studio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. BACK GARDEN/STUDIO - MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK GARDEN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but doesn't want to appear unsympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>

	Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.

<ALICE>

	I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They hack into people's programs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>

INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>

Milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket. He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic strand (from Teddy's floor). Shows it to her.

<MILO>

(almost silently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a camera.

They've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging his paranoia.

	It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice, wearing dishwashing gloves, ties the alarm clock to a small Tupperware container with copper wire.

Milo (wearing latex gloves) is at the sink, mixing chemicals from the toy chemistry set. Alice approaches with the container affixed to the clock. As she holds it out Milo pours the mixture into it.

Milo stands in the open door of a refrigerator, as if searching for a soda. He's looking up the hall, waiting for someone. He consults his watch. 10:53.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.

Here comes a GUARD; he nods to Milo as he passes. The Guard opens a door with his card. Milo rushes through the door on the Guard's swipe -- "tailgating."

Milo sits, watches Shrot encode a new card for him, finding his info on a terminal. On a monitor behind Shrot, Milo sees Programmers being ushered out of the building.

	Every geek has to try this once to show me how smart he is --

	There was an explosion in a Y-sector closet, we're evacuating the whole sector.

Shrot comes to his feet, grabs a holster (with gun) off a shelf. Milo, looking flummoxed, stands.

Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing the system with his unique concentration.

Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the debris, puts them in a tray.

Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a room under construction...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty hallway), stops the tape.

Randy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's innocence, he isn't.

He walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs.

Milo reads a warning message. DOWNLOADING PLAYBACK STREAM TO RECORD CYCLE WILL CAUSE BIT OVERLOAD. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED? Y/N. He types Y.

They've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling nervously with the dummied swipe card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his James Bond BMW...
</DIRECTION>

Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm?

He slides the card, the door clicks.

INT. BLDG. 21 - INNER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls, bare floors, unconnected wires. The only illumination is from construction lights on the concrete floor. Opening doors, he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bare rooms. Wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment, bundles of wire hanging out. In other words: the building is as advertised, so far.
</DIRECTION>

Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean- swept path that leads to #21.

INT. BLDG. 21 - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo nears a set of double-doors at the end of the hall. He hears a low ominous hum from within. Convinced he's found something, he quickens his pace. He's about to swipe his card when a beam of light bounces along the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses himself into an alcove. Through a chink in the unfinished wall he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delbert come in the front door. His rounds consist of shining his torch up at the cameras, making sure the red lights are on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the humming gets louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MILO: pressing himself into the alcove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall... exits the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall. Using the card, he enters
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BIG SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed in but not plaster-boarded. The portentous hum comes from around a corner. He approaches, convinced the answer lies here. Clearing the wall he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A squat emergency generator sitting on the floor, powering construction lights. Something you'd buy at Sears.
</DIRECTION>

QUAD - TIGHTER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo sags onto the bench. He stares out, perplexed, suffering. Then he knits his brow. He seems to be studying -- the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up, turns around. REVERSE ON:

The whimsical canine. Push toward it's ears cocked to the sky... Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete, but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal: satellite dish.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, into the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMPUTER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings are of desks or tables with computers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. Milo passes it. And comes back to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his frustration evident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All of them show variations on a theme:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug- shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being interrogated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. "DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without audio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He types some more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: "Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter Type PBX-R17."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.

On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in the 2nd window: a steel hasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of a serene, eminently sane female:
</DIRECTION>

Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.)

It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel.

Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard.

The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow: he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost urgently, till the narration crackles back on:
</DIRECTION>
<MULTIMEDIA_NARRATOR>

	-- Rebecca P, a Connecticut art stu- dent facing Federal drug charges, whose records were supplied to us by N.D. 47.

</MULTIMEDIA_NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again:

The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, Milo jams the card in deeper:
</DIRECTION>
<MULTIMEDIA_NARRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...she planted the sesame seed both to test the extent of his proclivity and to provide a bonding experience, since she would quote "save his life."

The screens show the children's contour images, again. Where's Milo?

Randy takes a seat at the same console Milo was at, and begins to type. Camera booms slowly down beneath table-level to find:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white, as he clings to metal table braces. The toes of his sneakers are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower and the table bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward Milo's back. Milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work, zooms in on his screen to begin collecting his code.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow and, worse, on his hands. They're giving way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY: clicks. A printer across the room start making a hard- copy of the purloined code.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from its ports. He tries to lift it back up with heels of his shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY: knits his brow as his screen flickers. He keeps typing, but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels, while trying to maintain his balance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits keys. Just as he is about to clear the level of the table -- the screen re-illumines. He comes back up.

MILO: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels his hands slipping...

MILO: flops to the carpet(!) just as --

RANDY pushes away from the table... From the floor

Milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes.

Milo traces Randy's steps. He sees the door with the Civil Defense sticker, intuits how Randy got here, i.e, how one moves, unobserved, between the Day Care and #20.

	My goodness.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Alice is on the phone in the front room. Agitated, she puffs on a pencil (surrogate cigarette). We hear Phil through the receiver:
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(ON THE PHONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>

	No.

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll tell me when he gets home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be a test, won't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.

</PHIL>
<ALICE>

	Prick.

EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo comes up the path. He pauses as he nears the door: he's not sure he can pull this off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Milo enters, Alice rushes to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost nine, I've been so worried!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she takes his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you see in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him as he collapses onto the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember Lyle Barton?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guilt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor baby. You know that's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly. He closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch. Then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he can't stand it. He gets up, looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought, instead of indulging all these paranoid delusions, risking my job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I should do something useful with my grief. Help them find Teddy's killers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't see her smile: is that all. Assuming an appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him:
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was so worried about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns him around, kisses him. Her eyes are closed. His remain open. He's looking at her. Trying to comprehend the treachery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She touches him, breathes heavily. She wants more than kisses: to prove to herself how wrong Phil was, her professional pride insulted. Or perhaps it's more personal than that, especially with Lisa as a potential rival.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(through their kisses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...been such a long night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
But she doesn't stop. She moans as she presses herself to him: wants proof of his devotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's on top of her in the moment just after. Her eyes are closed. He stares at her -- glares at her -- with what we recognize as spent anger.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was -- different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Different?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Shit. She knows.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't feel it? So intense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
What's clear is, she liked it. A clap of thunder takes us to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's pouring. Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking in the window at someone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIZZA PLACE - MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa reads a paperback at a table, a slice of pizza on her plate, an umbrella hooked to her chair. Sensing someone standing over her, she looks up. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're not avoiding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Milo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He speaks very quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I snuck into #21.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you do a thing like --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Day Care?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Two Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a laptop case slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we go someplace else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why would they --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She's peering at him. He reads her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not one of them. Not trying to "suss you out."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She wants to believe him.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They killed my best friend! I'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me. Can't you trust somebody just once? I don't wanna be alone here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she can't quite do it.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles sadly as she backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(forcefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what he did to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's in my -- file?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She shakes her head: no.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that my -- scenario?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(when he hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'd frame him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's out of prison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(he nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses, tries to back away.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
But he holds on.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's gonna hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he wraps his arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell. After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Milo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm.

Alice nods. She sits in front of leather-bound books.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich√© about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wasn't acting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think he knows how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Phil looks convinced. Gary doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY/GAS STATION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up in the next lane. Ostensibly, they have run into each other on the way to work. They are smiling, casual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear no connection to their words.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the FBI?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.

</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who can we trust?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She defines it:
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless female." He comes over to help her.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't tell anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she's puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We tell everybody. At once. So there's no secret left to protect. When everybody knows, they don't dare touch us.

	No, Tony can't fill in for you, he's not at your authorization level.

</SHROT>
<LEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?

<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>

	We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.

	Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.

	What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Milo thinks: he's testing me.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Worse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.

<DIRECTION>
(mimicking a voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

EXT. LIBRARY/PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking it through.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they'd still get the idea, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.

</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
The complications pile up. They walk. They think.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go look.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll just have a few more pictures of me snooping around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the park, stop walking.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why were you so careless?

</MILO>

<MILO>

</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

<DIRECTION>
(she gets bashful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked you. I was checking you out.

He kisses her. There are no constraints now, there's no "adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred.

<MILO>

	"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, rather bashfully.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --

It's painful for him: losing a second father.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Larry used to say how the guys who wrote the first cool operating systems, like the UNIX guys at Berkeley? They just gave it away. They figured it was human knowledge, it belonged to the world, like Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what I'm gonna do after we broadcast the incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire code. Then nobody can have a monopoly.

<DIRECTION>
(holding his gaze)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you can't keep anything from me.

	Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(is she buying it?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...

Of course she buys it: it's in the file.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morning TV is on in the kitchen. A Seattle station airs a puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in formal clothes (including Gary & his Wife) hold drinks and eat canap√©s on the terrace over Lake Washington. (Gary's haircut is different: it's file footage.)
</DIRECTION>
<TV_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last years' party-goers pledged over $2 million to the Museum; this year's event promises to raise even more. Lured in part by the chance to see the stunning Boyd house...

But he's out the door. She's not entirely displeased by such a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her.

EXT. BUILDING 21 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable. The needle on the meter dances.

Milo types madly on a four-year-old PC. It takes him a moment to notice SISTER BEATRICE.

	This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed just before finals.

	I needed t'see it up close for a graphic. The outpost with a dish on top? I climbed up there to get it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>

She hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish. He looks at her, at the drawing, at her again. She's scared, but tries to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHROT>
<DIRECTION>
(hands back the drawing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time you ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHROT>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, she gets up. The meter tumbles to the floor, thud. She goes white. But when she looks up, she sees
</DIRECTION>

Shrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving a printout.
</DIRECTION>
<LEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Might of found something.

</LEN>
<DIRECTION>
Lisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len. As she goes out, she hears:

Milo looks up as his train comes into a station. Lisa enters the car, carrying a stack of comix. He stands, they kiss, he takes the comix.

<MILO>

	Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.

	They know I broke in. Alice helped me.

	He doesn't know about the Day Care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>

	Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?

A busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Programmers, including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room.

Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation instantly drops out.

Milo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation.

</SHROT>
<DELBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>

Shrot hands Delbert the printout. Delbert looks at it: dense with coded entries. He stares at it.

Milo sits with Lisa as she brings up the graphic interface she's designed for the Skywire broadcast. It's an Outpost desktop, with recognizable logos, fonts, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One window'll be obits I downloaded, based on the scenarios you described. The other windows'll accommodate the surveillance stuff you told me about. The idea is, this works with anything, since we can't edit.

<DIRECTION>
He nods. [It's not necessary for us to understand what she's saying, just so Milo does.] She holds up an audio copy of Gary's book, The Next Highway.

	Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.

He already looks nervous. We begin to hear live music.

EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music echoes from inside. Push past a line of cars and limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of it.

Milo and Alice get out. As they go inside, she pulls a tag from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

As Milo and Alice enter, he sees a Balthus painting re- digitize to a Mondrian.

	They called the house to ask who's your favorite painter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>

Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to sneak away, now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep guests from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass through to get to Gary's workroom). A Guy in a pretentiously hip tux tries to peek in.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence is restricted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOUSEMAN>

Milo looks a little more tense...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARTY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is full of people. A long windowed wall has been opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more Guests drink and chat, and an orchestra plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A giant Mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest ID card. Milo sinks a little more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Gary, his Wife (a blandly pretty blond) and two Men are grouped around a Monet set on an antique easel (thus clearly the real thing; Mrs. Boyd has prevailed.) Gary notices the giant digital Mondrian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray. He hands one to Alice as Gary et. al. approach.

speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSEMAN>

He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door.

<MILO>

</HOUSEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman watches, Milo goes into the

<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo makes his move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom door, assumes Milo's still inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital art, now a Bosch again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, tastefully decorated rooms are blending together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly- appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich, professionally-decorated taste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a direction, keeps moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled with a Mondrian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He and Alice share a look as he moves off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he hardly hears them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC screen:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALTITUDE - 426 MILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different Mondrian, in a different room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo still working...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her face sets grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Milo senses something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(reading the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left my party to send E-mail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Gary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music floats in from afar as the moment stretches.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could've handwritten it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
This hangs there.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
The Second Houseman sticks his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<HOUSEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything OK, Mr. Boyd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOUSEMAN>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(when he's gone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see what's hanging on the wall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the art books, vaguely looks through one.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will you have a Beta version?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you have to remind yourself: it's just the process. Something's always lost along the way to anything worthwhile. Some little bug, some glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in that, you're doing something other people could never do. They lack the imagination, the brain, the nerve. Let them fret about every unforeseen consequence. You have to solve the problem. That's who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT DRIVEWAY/MILO'S CAR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the car, Milo and Alice pull away from the lights and limos in icy silence. Several beats.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna tell me where you went?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. She stares ahead, out the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you having an affair, Milo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(fighting tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just shut up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Or is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them? He's afraid, now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INT. DAY CARE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the children's shouts OS. Short, with a fingerprint kit, is dusting the keyboards. Len stands over him.
</DIRECTION>
<LEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around, perplexed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would Milo want in here, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEN>
<SHROT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHROT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIBRARY PARK - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he know you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he breathes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(knows she won't like it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've gotta go home for an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the interface.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
He takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her hair is askew.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook, since we're always afraid for you to eat in Chinese restaurants. I've been mincing things into teeny-tiny pieces all afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture?
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
When she turns away, we see the fear on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice pulls into a dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too fine to discern one ingredient from another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label on a jar, the label on a can...

Alice applies blush-on.

<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN

Milo goes through the spice cabinet...

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Either she's the most cold-blooded woman in the world, or...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard -- as if his life depended on it. When he releases her, she pretends to swoon. She backs toward the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big bowl as Alice spoons the food into it... She sprinkles on some final ingredient, also minced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo's fingers drum the table top...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice picks up the dish. We don't see her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DISH - MOVING - CONTINUOUS (ALICE'S POV)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold the dish out in front of us. The food shines in the light, a poisonous yellow gleam. We move from kitchen to dining room, slowly, deliberately...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile. We come all the way to the table with the dish, where Alice sets it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits. Milo, still vamping, pours wine. He picks up his fork. Stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
His mind churns furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't we have any chopsticks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right. Hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
When she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the tines of his fork against it, making score-marks, like those used by allergists to test for sensitivity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean. He stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN DRAWER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice roots through ladles, bottle openers, cheese graters, spatulas. At the bottom of the drawer, she finds two pairs of take-out chopsticks, wrapped in white paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo looks from his watch to his arm -- no reaction yet.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
But here's Alice. She slips into her seat.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...wanna savor this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna get cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Wait. A toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just afraid to eat it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, picks up her glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the artist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
They toast. She sips her wine. He sips his. He wants desperately to glance at his inner arm once more. But she's watching him, waiting for him to eat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite. She watches keenly. He brings the food to his mouth, passes it between his lips, swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact bracing for a paroxysm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict on the food, or for the first fatal spasm.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(his voice cracks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's great. It's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
She grins. She takes a bite. The moment she looks away, he turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tracks are still flat, there's no redness. He shovels a large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive. Then another bite, greedy with life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shrot and Len are in a high-tech office. On a monitor, we see a blown-up image of a fingerprint taken from Milo's keyboard; Milo's name is printed under it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a second window, other fingerprints flash by: thousands of prints lifted off keyboards in the Day Care.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shrot waits for a match to click in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo scrolls his Skywire code, concentrating intensely. Till he feels some stickiness on his thumb and forefinger. He rubs them together, peers at his keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

Milo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bumps into Gary's Secretary.

Len is at the console. On a security monitor, he has called- up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost running into Gary's Secretary.

Shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SHROT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's left his office, we think he's gone back to the Day Care for some reason. Can you tell me why, Gary?

	Whatever you say.

Shrot looks skeptical.

<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They let me break into 21. 'Cause there's nothing in there. You know they've been keeping things from you. 'Getting in the way when you try t'do your job. That's why you never told 'em your suspicions about me. Right?

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1. MOVE PAST ROWS & ROWS OF PC's playing surveillance footage, a crash-scene upload, and an obituary, in a college computer lab. Students watch, agog.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY_S_VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We work hard to stay ahead because we know any kid working in his garage can put us out of business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY_S_VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop. In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear).
</DIRECTION>
<GARY_S_VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first rule of the software business is: those who don't innovate are doomed to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY_S_VOICE_OVER>
<DIRECTION>
3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration:
</DIRECTION>
<GARY_S_VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications. Consumers don't care where new ideas come from, just so long as they're offered at competitive prices. Isn't that what the free market's about? Sure, we like being #1, but it's pressure, too. This business is binary: you're a zero or a one.

Paintings are gone from the wall, clothes flung around. Move in on a note pinned to the pillow, as the TV plays.

In one window, the Skywire code scrolls slowly past. In the other, it says: "Here's the code for the operating system that made this braodcast possible. Take it. Use it. Make the new convergence technologies as free as the Web."

Under the windows, these words scroll continuously: HUMAN KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE WORLD.

Watching, Gary knits his brow: he looks wounded.

Larry switches off the TV as he comes to his feet. A Mover passes by, hauling out a monitor. Larry explains:
