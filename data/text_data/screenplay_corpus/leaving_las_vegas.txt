INT. SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go to pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents and executives of all ages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into this bar comes Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has any of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he is much the worse for wear with drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben is not looking at him.

They shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and Peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie.
</DIRECTION>
<MARC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you. I think I spoke to you on the phone a couple of years ago. Weren't you both at MGM with Laddie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARC>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Are you still at ICM?

</BEN>
<MARC>

	No, I'm at Tri-Star now.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great. Say hello to Mike for me. That's a beautiful dress, Debbie, and those are fabulous earrings, Sheila.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and is not invited to join them. The girls smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MARC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta tell you, I'm a big fan of your writing. I loved Bay of Pigs.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot. I didn't actually write it, I just got the credit. I was fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I talk to you for a moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Peter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together. Peter speaks very quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Ben, I can't help you any more. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the last time. Promise. I just need some cash tonight. I lost my credit cards. The money'll be on your desk first thing tomorrow morning, Scout's honor. How's the new one coming along? I here you got Richard Gere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The two men look at each other for a while. Peter's friends are looking at them, as are other people in the room. Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some notes.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all I have in cash. Please don't drink it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's fine. I'll messenger it over to you tomorrow.

INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense of activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an insane New Age symphony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credit sequence ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the lobby from the street comes Sera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between twenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American girl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears catalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt and matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. She could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many execs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language is a bit different, though.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up and down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking. We hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls focus and we see reflected in the glass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a group of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and sandwiches. The TV is on at a sports channel and two boxers pound the shit out of each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in the elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens her lips. Some people get out and the elevator climbs higher. We see from the indicator that she has punched the Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we see that she is nervous but concealing it well. The elevator stops, the doors open and she steps right into the Penthouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. He is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, a big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair is greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, all gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late thirties listen to him.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but please, my friends, call me Yuri. It is my American name... I picked it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>
<DIRECTION>
The three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in the way that they speak to Yuri.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you from, Yuri? I mean, you sure don't talk like you're from this neck of the woods.

Yuri smiles at them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough place.

	Yes, I hear this too. But I am not a tough man. I am a simple man who is here to learn from my new American friends.

The door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.

The second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from his inside pocket.

YURI(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sera is my gift to you, my friends from New York City. You may do with her as you wish in this beautiful room, which is also my gift for the night to my friends. You will find her a very willing girl, for all of you…just as we arranged.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the envelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the idea of her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SECOND BUSINESSMAN Of course, Yuri. I think you'll find this just as we discussed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, my friends... I have other business to attend. Enjoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>

He heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm as he passes.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuri... please! Can I talk to you for a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>

Still smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the bedroom.

(seductive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are pretty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>

Sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal her buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other hand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks gently, like a father to a daughter.

YURI(cont'd)

Sera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning her jacket.

INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is a very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los Angeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five customers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is sitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress and the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. Barman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit from the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the TV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles to himself.

The talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the audience the prizes available in today's game show.

He looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to what is known as ”normal”. He finishes his drink and then an attack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls his neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink. Ben looks at his own hands…which are steady.

Ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup of black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed with scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says 'yes' or 'OK', but it becomes clear that there is no one on the other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes up to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of messages down on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but what's the back end like? By the time we're through with P and A, the above-the line is going to take it to about fifteen and with something like this... I don't know if Disney will go for it... can I call you back on this? OK... chow for now.

He slips a tape into the player and we hear ”Lonely Teardrops”, by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs. At a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and Ben takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the word ”hot”. The cop nods back at him, the light changes and they both pull away.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful, not just the shape which is nice, but the whole walk, the feeling, the movement. This girl is pleased with herself. Maybe this is the only art I can appreciate... I don't know if this is good or bad, but right now she is really beautiful. When I was a boy it would have been really important that she have a pretty face, to go with this body, I mean. I still would like to see her face, but her beauty is not dependent on her face.

Ben takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of shape. He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his hands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.

Ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. The house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up the glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles Davis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable. He turns on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. He puts the machine into the record mode. He kneels down next to the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the second track without any problem. The music starts and continues through the next sequence.

Showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks handsome and normal. He selects another record and again sets up the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo up full and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. In slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor. He smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a while...

He drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes it and then orders another. He looks around the bar and sees a woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive. She looks and sees Ben, and he smiles at her. She smiles right back. Ben talks across the bar.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get you another one... and me too. Mind if I join you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him walk to the bar. He gets the drink and walks back to her. He sets the drinks down on the table and sits down. As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she smells the booze on him.

<PRETTY_WOMAN>

</PRETTY_WOMAN>
<BEN>

She looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. She is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this much is clear to Ben.

Ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the bar. It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben... when they're up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all falls apart. She starts to speak but then doesn't. A look of great sadness comes over her.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_WOMAN>

A tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious to the men who stare at her. The trio grinds out a dirty blues. A man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between her legs an winks. The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and a bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him.

He looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up fast. Ben panics for a second. There is a bottle between his legs. The cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a while, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, doing a U-turn.

The TV is on, some game show as before, and Ben watches carefully, looking for a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 'normal' fashion.

Long-lens shot of Ben, very drunk on the street. He falls and lies still for quite a long time before getting up. He falls into the road and tries to hail a cab, but none stops. A cop car cruises to a halt and Ben more or less imitates a normal person as he walks out of shot.

EXT. THE POOL, MOTEL - DAY

Ben dives in and swims a length under water. He pulls himself out and sits next to the large Midwestern family. The father says hello and introduces his family to Ben. They are all very friendly. It's a nice atmosphere around this pool and for a moment Ben even looks healthy.

Ben sitting at a bus stop, drinking out of a cocktail glass. When he sees her he gets up, a little unsteadily.

</SERA>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri sits on the bed. He looks unwell and disoriented. His face is covered with a thin film of sweat. He seems to be listening for something, because he stops her talking by putting his fingers to his lips. He looks at her and then beckons her to the bed. Sera is nervous. As she walks to the bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. Yuri stops her with a wave of his hand. Sera is puzzled and frightened now. Yuri seems to be deranged.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>

	This is very important... and I must listen. Now go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YURI>

They face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an almost comic gesture to tell her to go. He hustles her to the door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her blouse. He slams the door.

<YURI>

(through the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Sera. Don't come back here. I will not see you again.

Sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she begins to walk. The camera follows her as she makes her way down the endless corridor of doors. Ahead of her, three men are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they make their way. Sera doesn't take them in. They pass and turn a corner. We recognize them as the men from the black towncar.

	It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, sand that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part.

	Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?

</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.

</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.

</BEN>

She reaches into her purse.

<SERA>

	Gift number one.

And she gives him a newly cut key. He takes it and tries it in the lock, then drops it into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to carry a lot of keys, but one by one they all fell victim to the great condensation. Now I have just this one... which is...

He shakes his head.

He sees the parcels.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah... more gifts. I have to sit down for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa. She follows.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
And he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen until this matter is resolved.
</DIRECTION>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
She is uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit in silence for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
	</DIALOGUE>

<SERA>

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever that means. Open your presents.

She hands him the larger of the two parcels.
</DIRECTION>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open this one first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. A genuine smile comes on to his face.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the shirt against himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should work very nicely with my suit, which, by the way, is the only item of clothing I brought over from the motel with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sera raise an eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I threw them into the garbage., which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty-five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the last present.
</DIRECTION>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, try this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... looks like I'm with the right girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must say that I'm very impressed that you would buy this for me. I know you wouldn't do this without thinking about it. Funny... you did just what I would have done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is fine. He walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to fill it right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit pocket and has a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hadn't planned to gamble... but if you would keep the bulk of my money here, then I could safely blow a couple of hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and then gives her the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Giving you money makes me want to come.

</BEN>
<SERA>

And she leaves. There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben is not sure if he offended her or not. He watches through the small angle of the door as she changes.
</DIRECTION>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am planning to go out and do some work.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<DIRECTION>
And she stops and looks at him, smiling but serious.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I only have eyes for you. And we both know that you would never become romantically involved with a trick, right?

INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk around the huge space, which is full of people and energy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a slot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and then she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some change, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to the bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more. They break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar. As he waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SERA>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)

Ben wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed. A night-light gives a soft glow. He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on the floor. He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. With difficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a drink. He swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just in case he has to vomit.

</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well - I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and what did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me - not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's impressive. How did you do that?

</BEN>
<SERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.

</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to m, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?

She turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.
</DIRECTION>

He thinks about this. He gently pushes her until she is lying on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes her naked back. He kisses her in the small of her back.

A very drunk Biker Couple argue noisily in a corner, slurring their words. There ins not much gambling taking place at the eight slot machines.

The Biker is about to hit Ben then holds back. He leans in and puts his face next to Ben's.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.

	Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.

Sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving board. As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out near Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends down and kisses Ben for a long time. Ben responds and kisses back. There is no one else around the pool.
</DIRECTION>

The kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, making him wet from her. He pushes the top of her suit down and kisses her breasts. She picks up the glass and drinks, letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. Ben drinks from her.

She stands up, covering herself. Ben stands up, laughing, loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. He falls backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on to the glass table. The table goes over and it and the glasses all shatter on the concrete. Ben falls on the broken glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. Glass goes into the pool. Blood mingles with the water on the steaming cement.

Sera comes to an elevator and waits. She is wearing a thin black top without a bra. Her bruised face makes her suddenly very conspicuous and vulnerable. A big man in a white stetson stands next to her. He looks at her and grins. She smiles, coldly. He takes from his pocket two black, hundred dollar chips, places one in each hand and deliberately places each one against her nipples. Other people see this and stop and watch. Sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man becomes uncomfortable.

For a moment it looks like Ben. The camera comes in tight on to her face. She looks more lost that we've ever seen her. She drinks coffee from a styrofoam cup.
