Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened...

Birkheim pores over spreadsheets, taking notes and comparing numbers. CLOSE UPS on headings like "INTEREST EARNED" and "DEPOSIT" indicate he's looking for something
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious until something catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the margin of one of the pages is a DOODLING of a SMILEY-FACED PENIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Birkheim doesn't quite know what to make of this... but it seems to stare at him mockingly.

Steven whistles happily and takes a draw off his coffee mug. As he passes an office, something catches his ear.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven runs into Birkheim's office and scans the papers on his desk. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his attention to Birkheim's briefcase, but he can't get it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it closely. He grabs a pencil and does the old detective trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written on the now missing page above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The embossed text reads, "837,502.12"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at it a moment. This number looks familiar. He grabs the phone and dials. An AUTOMATED VOICE answers.
</DIRECTION>

	Hello, you've reached the Automatic Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please enter your personal account number followed by the pound sign.

It's the SAME NUMBER as on the pad. He hangs up. And turns his attention to the calendar. He spies an entry that reads, "Harris County Police, 12:30"

<DIRECTION>
He leaps out of the chair and exits the office.

Through the glass wall outside the phone room, we watch as Steven continues to absorb the bad news.

He hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the CACOPHONY of the prison masks any sound of his grief.

In the REAR, Steven nervously and quietly prepares an INSULIN SYRINGE and inexpertly INJECTS IT in his belly.

He gives a quick look around and prepares another syringe. After another injection, he prepares another.

And then ANOTHER and ANOTHER...

Steven wakes up in a hospital bed. A little bleary at first, his eyes scan the room. He's alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up, pleased and very excited. He pulls out his IV, hops out of bed and heads for the window when-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANG! He stops short to find his ankle is shackled to the bed.

The judge finishes filling out the form and PLACES IT AT THE EDGE OF HIS BENCH for Steven to see.
