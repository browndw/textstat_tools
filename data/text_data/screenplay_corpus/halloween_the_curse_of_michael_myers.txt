:SC: HALLOWEEN 6 THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS fills the SCREEN. SUPERIMPOSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
October 30, 1995
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a labyrinth of winding underground tunnels. Glowing torches light the way. Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a gurney. Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door is SLAMMED. Wooden. Heavy. Muffling the SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW. Long black duster. Widebrimmed fedora. Lit cigarette dangling between gloved fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted rack. A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, it's coming! It's coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water. Jamie lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mary's face is frozen in horror. Jamie's SCREAMS build to an unnerving crescendo. The paiin too much for her to bear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her terrifying childhood ordeal:
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
A) LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous SHAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Now he wants her daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
B) Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) struggles to open the door. She flings it open. The Shape is standing there, knife poised to kill!
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael Myers is here to kill that little girl and anyone else who gets in his way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
C) RACHEL (Ellie Cornell) dies in anguish as the Shape plunges a pair of scissors through her chest. TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives right into the path of the Shape's knife. "Jamie, run!!!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its hand in her own. CLOSE ON the Shape's hand. Fingers flexing to life. A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock. A jail cell blown to oblivion. FIRESTORM rages. The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitiful wails of death. OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood. In the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie struggles against her bonds. Pushing. SCREAMING. Lapsing in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of labor. Haunted by low, moaning VOICES. CHANTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the smoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy chains -- into the back of a white van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another figure, obscured by smokescreen: the Mysterious Stranger!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like the Angel of Death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare. Crushed under the boot of the Stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van. Doors SLAM. Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOCK CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY. Jamie sobs uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please ... give him to me ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
The infant is wrapped in black swaddling. The wooden door CREAKS open. Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger fills the room. Standing at the threshold. Waiting to receive the child.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please ... my baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her desperate pleas. Torches lighting the way.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you!! Damn you all to hell!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the SLAMMING DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of flame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLOWEEN 6
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar. Ringed by eleven stones engraved with cryptic markings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hooded, faceless figures. Torches held aloft. Disembodied VOICES. Whispering. Invoking a dark spell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner. Eyes glazed with horror. Watching. Spying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The newborn SCREAMS. The flattened blade of a dagger smears a triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME. It burns off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOCK CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIGN POST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing askew in a matted patch of lawn. WIND and RAIN. INTENSE FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch. Leftover gallons of Sears Best. Brushes soaking in turpentine. A dozen or so 2 x 2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice. Address reads: 45 Lampkin Lane. Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard. New shutters on the narrow windows. A jack-o'-lantern grins behind filmy curtains. The Myers house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it did in "Halloween I."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back door. Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen. A drawer is opened. LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door. A bedroom. P.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in the throes of a nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in bed, looking right into the P.O.V. Sweating. Shaking. Petrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a 24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic monsters. Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW DANNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into the hallway. LIGHTNING FLASHES. With the next THUNDER CRASH comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny freezes. Slowly turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by LIGHTNING. Long duster and brimmed hat. The Stranger! In his outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!
</DIRECTION>
<WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill for him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny screams! THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY. Lights flash on. Doors fly open. Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms of his mother, KARA, 22.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
The little boy holds onto her for dear life. Crying hysterically. Eyes clenched tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh. Mommy's here. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The voice man! He's here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kara looks in the direction he's pointing. In the light there's just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and old silver-tipped umbrella.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, no one's there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer shorts and a well-worn undershirt.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of us have to get some sleep around here. What's with that kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me take him for you, Kara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBRA>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, Mom. Go back to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Debra sighs resignedly. TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his Walkman headphones and returns to his room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara opens the closet and switches on the light. Satisfying Danny that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away from Danny. You jerks know the rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crossing to Danny's bed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy, when can we go home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kara sighs. They've been through this one before.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house. At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did, did they? Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've seen him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been watching too much TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says things. Bad things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny is afraid to tell her.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, ignore him. Once he gets to know you he'll come around ... Let the bad things you hear slide right off your back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead. Then she goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up; panicked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mom -- keep it on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay ... But just for tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school drawings to fly off the wall. She picks it up on her way out.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-night, Danny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kara softly closes the door. Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up to his chin, eyes wide. Still very much afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's drawing on a pile of open books. Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke cans. Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love him. I write to him every week. I think I even want to have his child --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY SIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight, Debi. Now you're saying that not only does this guy get you sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his offspring?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair. Beneath her studious exterior, she is quite attractive: delicate features with an enviable, naturally-toned figure.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just needs someone to understand him. Someone to love him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're talking about one of this nation's most notorious serial killers like he belongs in some kind of Est seminar! What planet have you been on, lady? Michael Myers has been dead for six years!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
A CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a face -- in the mirror!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARA'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street. Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in the uppermost window -- looking right at her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON KARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing. A child's scribbling in red Crayon: The triangular symbol of Thorn!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street. An ornate sign on the front door reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Blankenship House - Rooms Available"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands. An insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged helterskelter on a wall: "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM." "HORROR IN HADDONFIELD: MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES." "REIGN OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system. A cassette tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we've got someone who claims he's actually seen Michael Myers. Does this whacko caller have a name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, cradles a cordless phone.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Tommy. I was only eight- years-old when I saw him. But I was lucky. I survived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic apartment. Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, knives, and survivalist weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like you're a candidate for electroshock therapy, Tommy. Don't tell me after all this time you still believe Myers is alive?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield. Now it's just a matter of time before he comes home to kill again. But this time I'll be ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age: "November 1, 1978. TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH." Directly beneath this: "November 3, 1989. JAMIE LLOYD FEARED DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets. Eyes closed. Deathly still. Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE pierces the darkness:
</DIRECTION>
<WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamie? Jamie?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her straps.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me if you want to save your baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie can't believe her eyes. Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- revealing the baby inside!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern. Jamie leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God ... He's coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to move. Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUNNEL GATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys. A massive iron gate rises, revealing a pair of filthy work boots. Legs planted in bold stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless flight through the winding network of tunnels. Haunted by the ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs. Slow by determined. Sensing the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! It's that way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save your baby -- go now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel. Mary quickly removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
surges around a corner. FINDS Mary. MOVES IN on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary turns in small circles. Fear mounting as she falters into darkness. Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her. THE SHAPE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her up by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large metal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its relentless pursuit. Eerie under the lighted torches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie runs frantically. Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her. She chances a look behind. The Shape is coming!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell. A trap door above. It won't budge. Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape mounts the stairs!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open. Tumbles onto muddy ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles with her baby through an ugly, charred forest. Sharp branches whip at her face. RAIN falls. LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack. She picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth. The Shape is right behind her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up glasses. Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next up is Dwayne. What's on your feeble excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTORIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTORIST>
<DIRECTION>
Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd just like to say that I listen to your show every night, Harry. I think you're the best. I can't tell you how excited we are that you'll be paying a visit to our little town tomorrow night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or should I just keep practicing my wrist exercises?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(chortles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, you're too much. I'd just like to say that I understand how things have changed in the 90's. Gays in the military, cut off your husband's do- jigger, become a national hero. But I just can't see any sense in bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
The Motorist looks up. Eyes go wide with panic. Startled GASP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

	Drive! Goddamnit, drive!

Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the outline of a quickly-approaching man. Unrolling his window, he rubbernecks a look outside.

	Hey, what do you think you're --

</MOTORIST>
<DIRECTION>
CRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!

Jamie SCREAMS! Lunges for the steering wheel. Slams her foot down hard on the gas.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin. This is a man's retreat and has been for years. Dark wood, worn leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques. Floor-to-floor ceiling shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of awards and degrees, all bearing the name: SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 Bremer-Tully.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to that psychiatrist of his? Loomis, I think was his name. I heard the old quack was dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_CALLER_4>
<DIRECTION>
Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee. For the first time ever, we actually see him smile. The burn scars on his face have all but faded away. Last traces of the horrid past.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not dead. Just very much retired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper article. As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.

	Christ, what a night! Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!

	That's the whole idea of living in the country. I thrive on the seclusion.

Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his golden years. I don't buy it for a single second, Dr. Loomis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in all these years, I've never known you to make house calls, Dr. Wynn. Especially at this hour ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses. Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said: 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.

	I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.

</LOOMIS>
<WYNN>

	Retiring.

Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why -- congratulations! I can think of no one better suited for the position.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion. But Wynn's angle soon comes to the helm.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone who can bring new life -- and some old blood, if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our program ...

Loomis prepares himself for the bomb.

<LOOMIS>

	You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left. I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country. Old colleagues. This is your change to finally make a difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire. Now things have changed. I've changed. The ghosts have been buried. Why on earth would I want to dig them up again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing at the desk, looking through his scrap book.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's still lurking in your closet.

INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN. Bone weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, the other on the CRYING infant.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	God ... Help us, please ...

Something up ahead. Jamie's face fills with expectancy.

A lighted sign appears out of the darkness. Glowing salvation. Familiar red-white-and-blue logo. "GREYHOUND."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights. SKIDS to a stop in a deserted parking lot. Jamie staggers out, cradling the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie blasts through double glass doors. But the bus station is devoid of life. Empty benches. Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE signboard. The low hum of vending machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie moves toward the ticket counter. A handwritten sign left by the attendant: "BACK IN 20."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone booth. Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911.
</DIRECTION>

Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the door. The radio program still squawking in the b.g.

<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules. Just think it over.

	Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.

As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bus has arrived. The ATTENDANT returns to his post. Jamie hangs up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside. A strung-out ROCKER. A pair of stern-faced NUNS. A PRETTY TEENAGER greeted in the loving arms of her BOYFRIEND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a TALL MAN, back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand outside the booth! Jamie freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door. Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path!
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right, young lady?

Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away. Backing down a narrow hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water runs into a grimy basin. Unable to contain her tears, she washes the newborn. Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub the triangular blood mark off his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the lights go out. Jamie gasps. Clutching her baby, she turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door CREAKS open. FOOTSTEPS echo inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE

<DIRECTION>
has locked herself inside one of the stalls. Heart pounding. The FOOTSTEPS grow louder. Jamie's eyes dart frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STALKING P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, revealing that they are all empty. A CRASH from the last stall. P.O.V. moves toward it. RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside.

<DIRECTION>
A HAND pushes on the door. An open window above the toilet. Jamie is gone!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and dashes around the side of the depot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, disappearing down the highway.

Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack. She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition. The engine REVS to life. She guns it, peeling out of the parking lot. Back toward the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat. Then she turns and looks forward with concentrated attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
A sign looms ahead: "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi."

Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as --

HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of blackness! Jamie's eyes flood with terror.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently against the pickup's rear bumper.

JAMIE

The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double yellow line, scraping sides with the truck.

Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck profile. SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour.

The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder. It leaves the road, tearing branches from trees. Jamie SCREAMING.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - THE CHASE

<DIRECTION>
A quick-cut MONTAGE, events ticking out in fractions of a second like a nightmare:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field. A pumpking patch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van reappears in a glare of headlights. Its engine screaming with fire-breathing rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed. Eating up pumpkins and spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing past the pickup, cutting right in front of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PICKUP

Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the windshield!

Glass EXPLODES! Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to protect her face. Swerving wildly out of control.

She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her. Wide, cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary!

<DIRECTION>
The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong into the trunk of a huge oak tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent. Like a phantom in the night, the van is gone. The Shape nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered glass and mangled steel. Pinned against the base of the tree is a shape in human form -- a scarecrow!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel. Coughing on the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life. Slowly, painfully, she shoulders the door. Falls onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SPARK ignites. BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting the truck ablaze. Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror. Debris rains down on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field. The Shape -- wielding an enormous butcher knife!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of SUNLIGHT. Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" sign. Stage blood spells out the words: "He's coming!"
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument that's been left on his front lawn during the night. Puffing on a cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a large axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween costumes -- stand a safe distance away. Gathered on the sidewalk. Gawking, whispering, tittering.

John angrily swings the axe into the signpost. The kids jump with a collective start.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the hell off my property! One, two --

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
That's all it takes. The kids scatter, tripping over one another as they tear off down the black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters the house. Uttering oaths under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed. SUPERIMPOSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Haddonfield, Illinois. Halloween."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and picturesque morning. CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of paint, somehow manages to look invite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white van slowly rolls up the street. WKNB logo, streamers and a large orange banner proclaiming: "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31." A now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:

A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing curtain of security gates. A large sign reads: "SMITH'S GROVE - WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an infrared scanner. Surveillance cameras perched on the walls.

Gold insignia on mahogany doors: "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF."

Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area. DAWN, an attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>

	Cancel all my appointments. Get Dr. Loomis anything he needs -- files, tests, records of every treatment ever administered to a former patient of ours -- Michael Myers.

Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding.

CORRIDOR

Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor. Wynn uses his key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages. A retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove medical transport helicopter awaits them. The deafening WHINE of spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.

The doctors step inside. The doors close and the helicopter lifts off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate Yoo-Hoo, banana yogurt and chewy Gummi-worms as Tim, wearing Levi's baggies and a "Harry Simms Kicks Ass" T-shirt, raps on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city. Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got everything arranged. Get with me tonight at the fair and I'll hook you up. Peace.

</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.

<DIRECTION>
John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>

Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd better get Danny to school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She don't show her face for five years, then expects us to roll out the red carpet. You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl?

Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume. ROARING loudly. Startling John.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back door.

<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, Danny.

</KARA>
<DEBRA>

Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash. While you're at it, why don't you just give her all our goddamn money?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the floor. Debra recoils. Kara steps in. Danny is terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from her, you bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(re Danny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only see one bastard in this house.

Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage. John instantly grabs her by the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.

<WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISPERING_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny moves across the kitchen. Mesmerized. Through the screen door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat. Choking her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill you, you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his groin. Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless. Ever so slowly, John releases Kara. Debra and Tim watch in horrified astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door. Kara dives toward Danny. The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs her book bag and hurtles outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make way for the Hardin County Express.
	</DIALOGUE>

(following them across the yard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where's Tim? We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight --

Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck.

</KARA>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pig. What the hell happened this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>

Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms around Beth, attacking her with kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, hot lips. We got work to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times o I have to tell you? It's not about Halloween. It's about being political. There are too many people with corn-cobs up their ass in this town telling us what we can and can't do. If we want change, it's up to us to set an example.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in her purse. John stares coldly out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want her and that kid out of here tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Debra rises, facing him scornfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought inheriting your father's house ... the business ... moving out here might change things. But you're still the same, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with finality)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let you turn her away again.

Debra storms off. John bores holes into her with his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper stickers. Kara and Beth in front.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever happened to women in back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reality check, dillweed. This is 1995.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>

The old woman just stares forward. A gardem hose in hand as she waters a garden of long-dead flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARA'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white van that is following them.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You interested?

</BETH>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean Tommy. Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven. Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid. Messed up his head. He's harmless, though. Probably just lonely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or horny.

</TIM>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tim, do you always have to act like such an asshole?

<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, chill, sis. I'm just doggin' ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off. Beth lays on the HORN. Slams on the brakes. Narrowly avoiding a collision.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speed kills, asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on. For a breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the intersection. Idling. A tense stand-off.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is that ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver. A momentary glimpse of a pale white face behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(bravely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got my pepper spray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Danny sits frozen in the back seat. Suddenly the van shoots forward, tires SCREAMING. Startled GASPS. The van turns off sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy fuckin' Halloween.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.

Beth drives on, grimly determined. Kara looks back at Danny. He returns her frightened gaze.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tommy paces in his cramped apartment. Dark circles under his eyes. A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's Harry Simms broadcast:

	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Frustrated, Tommy plays it again. Adjusts the speed. Tries to make out something else in the b.g. Jamie's voice comes through. Slow. Eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (continuing; slowed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber jacket and bolts straight out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor. Headlines read: "November 5, 1989. JAMIE LLOYD STILL MISSING." "November 19, 1989. MYERS' NIECE PRESUMED DEAD."

The Explorer pulls up to the depot. Tommy makes a beeline for the entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles.

INT. BUS DEPOT (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy wades his way through a small crowd up to the ticket booth. A cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him.

The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth in the corner. Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to dial a number. Makes a cursory inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY'S P.O.V. - PHONE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, tiny droplets of what appear to be blood form a dotted trail out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY

follows the crimson path around the corner down a dim hallway, stopping at the door marked "Ladies Room." Checking first to make sure the coast is clear, he steps furtively inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy walks past the sink. Water drips into the filthy basin. He touches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE. Muffled, indistinct. Like CRYING. Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the long row of empty stalls. The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the final stall. Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hole in the wall behind the toilet. Tommy reaches in, his hands locking onto something. Shock and amazement overcome him when he lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.

DEPOT HALLWAY

SHOCK CUT TO:

HELICOPTER P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of THWACKING BLADES as we FLY past a winding rural highway over a dense grove of oak trees -- massive, ancient guardians of the sprawling pumpkin patch that lies beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we circle the field, red-and-blue gum machines -- police cars, fire engines and ambulances -- can be seen through gauzy veils of rising BLACK SMOKE, dissipating with the strong WIND.
</DIRECTION>

Charred in the ground, three intersecting lines stretch a hundred feet across the plan to form a vivid geoglyphic. The symbol of Thorn.

The helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth. Loomis and Wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW them through EMERGENCY CREWS and a few CURIOSITY-SEEKERS toward the center of attention. A charred body is lifted from the eviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.

Loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.

Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation. The Deputy whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that give new meaning to the term "bad ass."

Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.

As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated.

EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laden with her book bag, Kara exits the library and heads across the campus green. All around her, the sights and sounds of the impending carnival come to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rides assembled. Paper witches hang from broomsticks. Goblins lurk behind syrofoam gravestones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara waves at Beth in the distance, making last-minute preparations. Student volunteers scurrying in every which direction. Donning costumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ducking for apples booth. Homebaked goodies set out on picnic tables. Long rows of pumpkins lined up for a jack-o'-lantern carving contest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The centerpiece of all this is a huge, magnificently decorated HALLOWEEN TREE. Tim and a gaggle of WORKERS stream up ladders, stringing lights, hoisting up colorful bunting filled with mounds of candy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kara walks along, her hair being tossed about in the brisk WIND, she becomes aware of the magical, almost out of time quality that seems to hang in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara walks past the crows of "Harry-ites" gathered outside the campus gates, now extending half-way around the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WKNB van rolls by, exhorting the crowd with the voice of the man they've all come to see:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY_SIMMS>

(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost that time, all you kiddies and women with big -- hey, what rhymes with kiddies? So let's count it down as we get down to the witching hour!

Kara walks on, smiling to herself as the crowd bursts into gales of wild, exuberant CHEERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAMPKIN LANE / MYERS HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The setting sun glows behind the trees, casting long shadows as Kara rounds the corner onto her street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIDS already pouring out of their homes, some accompanied by PARENTS, others joining groups of friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara ambles up the walk of the Myers house, shoes clapping up the porch steps as she digs the keys out of her overstuffed bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unbolting the door, she finds that it's secured with the chain-lock. Kara pushes on it, calling inside.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I'm home ... Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Puzzled, she steps off the porch and makes her way around the side of the house, CAMERA FOLLOWING as she peers into the windows along the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara walks along the billowing clotheslines, passing the blank spot where the blood-stained sheets were -- and are no longer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the back door. Standing ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom?

</KARA>

Casting one last glance across the yard, she steps inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Everything in its proper place. Kara drops her heavy bag on the kitchen table and proceeds down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM / FOYER - DUSK INTO NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is quickly falling into darkness. The eeriness almost palpable. Kara advances into the living room, eyes roaming.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom? ... Danny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Kara moves into the foyer. Her mother's suitcase still sitting there. Beyond, the cellar door stands wide open. Kara moves toward it, peering into blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden CRASH from upstairs. Kara jerks the door closed and looks up the deeply-shadowed staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom? Are you there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
A muffled ROAR. Kara mounts the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara reaches the second floor landing and moves slowly toward the door at the end of the hall. Danny's room. An orange glow flickers around the edges of the closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARA'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand grabs the doorknob, turns it. The door swings open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone sitting on the edge of Danny's bed. A man. His back turned. Dinosaurs ROAR on Sega Genesis. Danny squatting on the floor, engrossed in his game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara stares at the intruder in horrified disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
The man watching over Danny turns toward Kara. It's Tommy.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-I'm your neighbor from across the street. My name's Tommy. Tommy Doyle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked, Kara makes a wall of herself between Tommy and Danny. The little boy isn't the least bit fazed.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing with my son? Where's my mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>

Tommy backs off a tick, calmly trying to explain.

Danny finally looks up, exasperated.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy's my new friend. We've been playing 'til you got home. He knows all about dinosaurs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

One look at Danny's black eye and Kara goes ballistic.

	My, God! What have you done to him?

<TOMMY>

Kara starts to drag Danny away by the arm. He resists angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't Tommy! It was the voice man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

Kara sees Tommy hunkering down in the corner, lifting something out of a crate -- a makeship crib. He turns, his expression very grave. Holding the baby.

<DIRECTION>
Jamie lies comatose, ensconced in the dim GLOW of monitors. Sustained by I.V.s and a breathing apparatus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN on Jamie. EKG registers rapid heartbeat. MOVE IN TIGHT on her eyes, darting beneath closed lids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - DISTORTED VISION (DREAM SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood-chilling SCREAMS as we MOVE rapidly through a BLINDING TUNNEL OF LIGHT. Blurred, indistinct images. FIGURES wearing long white coats flash along sterile walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we BLAST around corners, we realize we are seeing from the P.O.V. of a girl being pushed forward on a gurney. It is Jamie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her arm injected with a sedative. Eyes lolling. Succumbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMIE'S P.O.V. - MOVING (DREAM SEQUENCE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even more DISTORTED now, images swirling at random. Cold, staring FACES. Flashing lights on a wall panel: "3-2-1-B" -- an elevator. Going down. Down. Beneath the basement level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. The gurney SLAMS out into DARKNESS. VOICES ECHO. Lighted torches flicker on craggy walls.

SHAPE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pacing back and forth behind iron bars, agitated, disturbed. SEEING Jamie strapped to a table. Surrounded by robed figures. CHANTING. Weakly, Jamie reaches out toward the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Michael ... Help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a long SHADOW fills the room. The P.O.V. becomes more restless as the Stranger glides toward Jamie and disrobes. The figures close the circle. Jamie SCREAMS in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape's hands SLAM violently against the iron bars, a horrific SHUDDER of metal as we

Gloved hand covers Jamie's mouth. A switchblade FLICKS open.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your work is done, Jamie.

The glinting blade SLASHES across Jamie's throat, cutting off her soundless scream!

Then the Stranger flows out of the room. Spurs CLANKING. Like a thief in the night. The shrill sound of a BEEPER going off as we

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - NIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark blanket of night envelops the little town. The LIGHTS of the fair twinkle in the distance, bright and beckoning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Families -- men, women and children alike -- turn out from their homes wearing COSTUMES, joining a growing procession along the peaceful streets of Haddonfield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large group of PROTESTORS carry PICKET SIGNS in front of the campus gates. Rallying against the celebration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haddonfield's finest out in full force, squad cars sweeping alongside a black STRETCH LIMO as it makes its way through town. Tinted windows make it impossible to see inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT / HARVEST FAIR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Beth, standouts as punk versions of Frankenstein and his bride, stride purposefully toward the fair entrance. Beth is a jumble of nerves as she runs down her checklist of events.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!

	Relax. Everything's cool. Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?

Tim and Beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful movement.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIDS waving signs and T-shirts. Throwing themselves at the windows. Frenzied CLAMORING. Harry-mania abound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WKNB van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned with HAREM GIRLS and a large golden throne. The side door opens. A red carpet is rolled out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the steps. Spurs CLANKING on black boots. "Jesse James" style duster. Hat cocked slightly.

	Hellllo, Haddonfield!!!

</HARRY_SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd turns in a mass of confusion. Standing above them, waving from a microphone, is HARRY. Dark sunglasses. Gaunt, glacial features and an outrageous mane of black hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright orange boxer shorts that say "HAPPY HALLOWEEN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids go insane.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOOMIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Making his way through the teeming crowd. Walkie-talkie in hand. The helicopter zooms overhead. Wynn's voice squawks over garbled RADIO CHATTER. Conducting a surveillance by air.

Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff Holdt. Loomis meets his fiery gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way. You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge now. And I'm not about to stand by and watch you turn this night into some kind of sadistic witch hunt.

Carrying the CRYING baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby of the vintage boarding home. Polished wood. Framed old paintings. Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps.

Mrs. Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the GRINDING and SCREAMING on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon.

Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her. One we've seen eariler: "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?"
</DIRECTION>

The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload. Tommy dashes to the recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.

As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse.

Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby. Despite his clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.

Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a Power Ranger over an invisible race track. On the floor. Across the windowsill. Glancing across the street.

Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a moonlit tree. Looking right at Danny.

Danny backs away, terrified. Tommy and Kara are too concerned with the baby to notice.

For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at one another. Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door. Tommy's expression darkens once again. A man possessed.

	Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago. They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood. Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.

Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door. Leaving her alone with the children.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSES / STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind MOANS. Dead leaves blow across the WINDY lane as Tommy flies down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer. The Shape suddenly RISES INTO FRAME. Watching him peel off down the block. Taillights disappearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving erratically into the driveway of the Myers house.
</DIRECTION>

The Shape watches.

The car parks. Sits in silence. Suddenly the driver's side door opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem.

John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling. Picking himself up, he staggers out of the garage. Laughing. Singing.

John slams his weight against the door. It doesn't budge.

Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself steady. Skirting along the side of the house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

	Work all day and not even any supper ...

Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner. Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave. Then he flounders down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM / FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern. John stands there, listing. Bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his lumpy old recliner.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right ... You can all come out now ...

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Still no reply. John sneers, flicks on the television with the remote control and settles back into his chair.
</DIRECTION>

Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS. A shrill BEEP from the kitchen startles him. The microwave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils. Then he reaches for the microwave, opens it. But his dinner is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out on the kitchen table. John double-takes, mentally retracing his steps. Shrugs.
</DIRECTION>

John shakes the remote. Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you, you little brat? Danny?!

John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- and the entire house is plunged into blackness.

With that, John steps down into the basement.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John tentatively descends the stairs. Barefoot. The flashlight beam preceding his every step. A RUMBLING below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the single dusty window. John probes around, shining the flashlight over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet. Now flooding the entire floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which is running at full tact.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet. It drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- landing right at the Shape's feet. John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife. A loud WHAP as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box. Sparks wain from the wall. Electricity courses through John's writing body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Lights flash on and off in the windows. Suddenly the entire house is plunged into darkness.

Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air. Boots selling food and crafts. Children carving jack-o'-lanterns. Parents beaming with pride.

Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon. Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows.

Mrs. Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant, humming a lullaby.

If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the hazy shadow of the Shape looking in.

Walking, searching, hunting. Past a large tent where children are gathering. A sign reads: COSTUME PAGEANT.

<DIRECTION>
Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed. The PHONE RINGS. Tim ignores it, consumed by passion. Beth sits up nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>

Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, taking a candle with him.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. You answer it. I'll make friends with my soap on a rope.

BATHROOM - SHOWER (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lighted candle flickers. Tim waits for the running shower to warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from the mirror. He gasps. The Shape is standing right behind him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards. The chilling SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.
</DIRECTION>

Kara can SEE Beth on the phone. Sitting by the window.

Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife into her back. She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.

Beth SCREAMS unholy terror. But the Shape isn't through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's vicious murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes shoot down. A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily across the street toward the Myers house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No, it can't be true. Kara wheels around. Danny is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW

Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room. The knife repeatedly, mercilessly SLASHING down at her.

Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.

KARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the Myers house. Disappearing inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoots across the lawn. Up the porch steps. Right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara dives through the front door. THUNDER shatters the house. Everything is frighteningly dark. Shockingly quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inch by inch, she makes her way inside. Eyes wide. Savage. Shaking uncontrollably. A CRASHING SOUND behind her. She jumps out of her skin. Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(the faintest whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
She advances into the hall. Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet. SOUNDS up ahead. FOOTSTEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara looks up. LIGHTNING FLASHES. Danny is nearing the top of the stairs!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinct propels her up the stairs after him. Then suddenly she stops dead. Reason taking over. And she turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner. Then she heads back up the stairs. Mind-blown with horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway. Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image. Kara startles. Follows him inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny stands in a corner. LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs. Kara goes to him, takes his hand. He resists her.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(intense whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on ... Danny, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
She picks him up, carries him toward the door. LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS. Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall. Eyes probing. Walking right past them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the bathroom. Adjoining on the opposite side into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARA'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING CRACKLES. The walls are covered with blood. Kara stumbles over something on the floor. Cranes her neck to look down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door. Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a horrified rictus of death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara SCREAMS. Drops Danny. Quickly covers her mouth. Realizing that she's given them away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges. The Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, run!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
careens down the stairs. THUNDER RAGES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer. The Shape moves in, backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room. Suddenly she SLAMS the door on the Shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara tears off into the hallway. Turns. Waiting for the Shape to appear. It doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara vacillates down the hall. Jumping at every sound. Training her weapon at things unseen. SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable dark tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly something CRASHES down from above. Kara's mother, strung up on a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling! The axe still protruding from her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through the blackened doorway behind her. An unbearable moment of tension as we think the Shape's mask will be there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her! Tearing the dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest with a repulsive SQUISH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara wheels toward the stairs. The Shape advances. Swings the axe. Misses her by inches. Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape. Swings the fireplace poker with everything she's got. CRACKING it full-force over the back of the Shape's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, SLAMMING hard onto the floor below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified, Kara chances a look down. The Shape doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)

Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house. Loomis and Tommy fly up the front path. Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

<DIRECTION>
Kara barrels off the stairs. Moves cautiously past the Shape. Sprawled face-up in the middle of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape. The little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape lying in between them.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, come to Mommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny shakes his head. Too frightened to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY / FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold. Hefting the fireplace poker, she steps right over the Shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms. Takes one step forward when suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle. She falls, splaying forward. The Shape claws at her leg. Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the vice-like grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors -- only to find that it is locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock! Too late to remove it. The Shape is right behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only one way to go. The cellar. Kara shoves Danny through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded basement floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering the wood as if it were paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs. Lifts Danny up the wall toward the window. But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted body, propped inside a storage cabinet!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes. Kara pushes him up. Danny reaches for the lock. Just an inch away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara can't lift him any higher. The Shape is coming!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock. He pushes the window open and clambers outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves. They break under her weight; she topples back to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape wades toward her. Reaching up for the window.
</DIRECTION>

Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's chest. Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window. Clawing at wet grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs. Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window. The Shape yanks hard. Kara catches herself on the window frame. Quickly losing her grip.

The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.

Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame. Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one massive heave.

Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up. Grabs Danny's hand and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES. She SCREAMS, recoiling. Then the window in front of her. HANDS reach through. Tommy shoves her out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, twists open the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.

Robed figures fill the doorways. Climbing through windows. Moving inside the house. Surrounding Loomis.

Kara trips and falls. A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in bold stance. Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn! Danny stands by his side, staring dispassionately.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, no ... please ...

Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering back down the hallway.

She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy. His SCREAMS swallowed by hollow darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into

Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.

Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled in her arms!

	Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --

As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger. Her eyes burning. Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara SCREAMS. The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to enter the room. Daggers drawn. CHANTING a dark invocation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coven forces Kara backwards. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the window!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Defenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below. A thousand grass fragments raining down on her.

KARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent repose. She doesn't move.

Suddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT. Glowing torchlight flickers across dank walls.

<DIRECTION>
KARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is being pushed forward on a gurney. Strapped down. SCREAMING for God's mercy.
</DIRECTION>

TOMMY

The main gate cranks open. The van pulls through.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you take Jamie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins. Michael's mother had it, too. So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night. Michael has served his purpose. And soon we will have a new progeny.

<LOOMIS>

	Jamie's baby ...

<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go trying to make sense again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grimly entranced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a curse. Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.

	Samhain.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Its calling card, if you will. I follow it. Protect it. Act as its guardian. In a sense, Sam, so do you.

Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.

	I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so much more for you to try to make sense of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office. Wynn and his white coats flow out behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tight, damp, claustrophobic space. Tommy is strapped upright to a crude metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through skin, wearing away his bonds. Breaking through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service elevator, leading him through the dark passageway. Wynn turns around, surveying the tunnel. As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open. Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs. Edging along the dank, torch-lit walls. WIND MOANS. Rats scamper past his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn has dropped his security key card. Tommy swipes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATWALK (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell. The Shape lies inside. Dormant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession. Michael Myers.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at him. So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I tell him to. Act on my impulses. Feels what I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn demonstrates. Loomis looks on, spellbound.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael -- Rise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Below, the Shape slowly rises. Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael -- Pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn cuts his hand. The Shape grabs his own hand in agony. Wynn smiles, sucking the bleeding gash.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael -- Kill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- inside the Shape's pit. Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis closes his eyes in anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've created a monster.

</LOOMIS>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amazing, isn't it? I even taught him to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>

Wynn carries on without remorse. Loomis is brutally shoved forward.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not the only ones, you know. There are many believers -- generous contributors to our church. You'd be amazed to know how far it reaches.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A metal door BUZZES open. Tommy makes his way furtively inside, pocketing the key card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates. Tommy pries one of them open. Eyes widening in startled disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a cartridge and bolts out the door. Back into the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, amber-hued chamber. The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of reverence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell. Waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis is led inside. Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to the altar. Looming over the terrified Kara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe. At Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE. The worshippers offer an obedient response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize many of the faces in the congregation. Wynn's staff. Dr. Bonham. Mrs. Blankenship. The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot. People from all walks of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(prophetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind, Disciples of Thorn! The final sign! The birth of the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Jamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn beside Kara. Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- etched with symbolic runes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels. Toward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CEREMONIAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coven CHANTS its invocation. Wynn draws a magic circle around the infant with blood from a silver chalice. Then he inscribes a pentagram in the air with an ornate dagger.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this ritual. Bear our gifts to Thorn. Open us to the path of Darkness. By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of Innocent Blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar. His eyes dark, lifeless pools. Kara struggles against her bonds.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis lurches forward. Halted by massive, restraining hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the evil ritual. Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains. Pulleys CRANKING. The Shape's cell being opened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CEREMONIAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward. Strangely calm. Hypnotized. Looming above Kara. She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror as he raises a gleaming dagger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn stands behind Danny. Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft. Above the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood. Let thy Darkness descend on your son. Danny. Lord of the Dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING infant. Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael, please. You can make him stop. You remember, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask. Listening. Reminded of his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told you to do. You can stop it, Michael. Stop the voice forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's eyes flash like fire. The CHANTING is insidious.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him, Danny. Kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, don't listen! The voice isn't real!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother. Suddenly terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him, Danny! You feel the rage inside! You are Thorn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Danny drops the dagger. Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an enraged beast. The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn's eyes go wide with shock. The Shape lurches empathetically. Wynn staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage of bullets from above. Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering, retreating into the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the dagger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE. The altar decimated. Candles falling. Setting the room ablaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk. Wooden girders CRASH down from the ceiling. Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet. Slowly. Painfully. Flames lapping at its back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis crawls toward the rifle. Grabs it. Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, a dagger at his throat. Pulling him away.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!

</LOOMIS>
<WYNN>

</WYNN>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the boy. Take me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn. Surrendering himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby. Paralyzed with horror as they try to anticipate Wynn's move.
</DIRECTION>
<WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles trenchantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis turns. Gasps in startled reflex. The Shape rises up behind him, swiping the dagger across his chest!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just as it SLAMS shut. Cutting them off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the crushed altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape turns on them! Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUNNELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOMIS

painfully crawls away.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Die, Michael. In the name of God, die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
END OF TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end. Kara pounds frantically on the elevator panel. A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glides steadily through the tunnels. A walking pillar of flame. Undaunted. Unstoppable. Hell-spawned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the doors open. Kara and Tommy barrel inside. Mashing buttons until the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara cradles the baby. Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and GRINDS toward ground level. The doors open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy leads her toward an exit sign. Behind them, the elevator doors close. The indicator light shows it moving down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a dead end. The row of coded security cages.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(realization)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the elevator doors open. FIRE GUSTS. The Shape emerges, totally engulfed in flame. The emergency sprinklers are activated. Dousing the flames as it walks after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy panics, runs the key card. The gate BUZZES open. They run through. The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They race toward the next gate. The gate behind them opens, and the Shape walks through!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy runs the card again. The gate BUZZES. They slam it -- one step ahead of the Shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third and final gate. Tommy tries the card. Nothing!
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(tries it again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not working!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape moves through the last gate. Inside the cage with them!
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's controlling it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. Wynn jams the card's access code. Then he grabs his satchel and strides quickly out of the office. Pulling Danny with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching. Kara's SCREAM can almost be heard on the silent monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage. Kara cowers in the corner, protecting the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter. Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY CAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor. Then turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WYNN'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire round into the security console. Destroying it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man holding the gun is Loomis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECURITY CAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door BUZZES open. Kara drags Tommy and the baby out. Slamming the door shut on the Shape. Trapping it inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field. Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward. The helicopter disappears into the gloom-filled night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy drags Kara in another direction. A vehicle parked nearby. The white van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara lifts the baby inside. Tommy flops down in the driver's seat. Face bruised and bloody. A key in the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara holds Jamie's baby. Tears falling.
</DIRECTION>
<KARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How will we ever find him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARA>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy's gaze terrifies her. He starts the engine and tears off toward the sanitarium gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask. Glowing in the darkness. Emerging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware. And that, for now, is how we leave them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
