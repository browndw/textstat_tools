EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see an Italian village at the height of the plague. Funeral processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up... the stench of death all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: EUROPE. THE DARK AGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse. He is weary but not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts. He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back. He enters the inn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inn is dark and almost empty. A couple of patrons drink silently at tables. Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, dark-haired and lazy. She scratches at her shoulder, on which we see a birthmark. The knight approaches the bar, throws money down.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A tankard of ale, wench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
The barmaid pours him a cup of ale. He drinks deep, stands a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>

	Some plague we're having, huh?

INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his room. The door opens inward. The knight stands in the doorway, places a hand on the barmaid's hip. She pauses a moment, then breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall. He laughs a bit, resignedly, and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VAMPIRE stands behind it. Not two feet from the knight, grinning at him. His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his head, his bloody smile full with teeth. His skin is gray, and peeling. The knight turns slowly and sees him.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my god...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire licks his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into the middle of the small room. The knight struggles but is no match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's neck. The knight screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire turns like a frightened animal. In the doorway stands the barmaid, a SLAYER. In her hand is a wooden stake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner. The Slayer and the vampire come at each other. The Slayer spins and kicks; the vampire flies back. Snarling, he comes back at the slayer. They struggle; he slips free and is out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor. The knight watches her. She seems to be making a decision -- perhaps even knows what is going to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire comes running out the front door. Before he is a few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through the upstairs window and lands on him. They both hit the ground, and she plants the stake right in his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, we hear a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<AMILYN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lord giveth, and the lord taketh away. Ashes, ashes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMILYN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<AMILYN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... All fall down
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMILYN>
<DIRECTION>
There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in the otherwise deserted street. At the front, maybe ten feet away, is AMILYN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King. His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery. He ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King. His skin is deep white, and smooth. He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any era. He is practically upon her before he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must forgive Amilyn. He tends to drool before supper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. He smiles, almost lovingly.
</DIRECTION>
<SLAYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lothos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLAYER>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people will never learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
She swings at him but he grabs her arm. Amilyn laughs obnoxiously. Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings her to him in a loving embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<LOTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't be stopped. This is our world now.

He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head hits the back of her legs. Lightning flashes.

Lightning flashes outside the window. It is torrenting rain. An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so. They are both obviously noble of birth.

He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder, identical to the barmaid's.

</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man unravels a satchel of cloth. From it he pulls an elaborately carved wooden stake.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers. Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.

As she grips the stake more tightly, an awareness and sense of power sees to fill her. She lifts the stake over her head.

CLOSEUP - A HAND

The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's. It holds not a stake, but a pom-pom.

EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opening CREDITS OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A football game in progress. The stands are pretty full, the crowd enthusiastic. The hemery football stadium is just that; a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very gracefully athletic. She obviously enjoys what she is doing, and she's good at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best friends. Beside them the COACH, yelling at the players. The scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left tackle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard loss.
</DIRECTION>
<COACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, do the play! The one where... the one from the book! Where you make it go forward!

	Grueller! Fill that hole! They were all over me! Okay. Let's run twenty-two. Grueller, close the pocket, watch out for thirty-five. Thompson, run the post, right, wide out. Jeffrey, go up the middle and run around like a chicken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They clap and break. As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at Buffy. She smiles at him. He winks, very suave.
</DIRECTION>

	Jeffrey! Jeffrey! He's our man! If he can't do it We don't want it!

<DIRECTION>
On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver. Jeffrey runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving his arms until Andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a touchdown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an impressive standing backflip. Nicole looks at her, impressed. Buffy smiles at her, giddy.

INT. THE MALL - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mall is typically busy. Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it. They are all dressed very similarly: bright colors, a lot of white and pink. Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired. Esprit. All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work.

A stranger, walking the other way, bumps into Buffy, doesn't stop. A man of about fifty, he is dressed shabbily, in a wrinkled black suit and a black shirt. He somewhat resembles a priest.

The girls continue walking. The man stops, turns to stare after them. His look is intense, slightly worried, his face somewhat haggard. Intelligence shines through his eyes. He holds himself stiffly, arms close to him, almost as if he expected something to strike at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is MERRICK. He pulls a picture out of his coat pocket, looks at it. Looks at them.

Seated a few rows behind the girls are PIKE and BENNY. The are fairly punked out, (and not currently attending high school). Pike is long and lean, has short hair spiked and a taste for long coats and black. Benny is somewhat stockier, opts for a shaved head and suspenders. Doc Martins for both. Benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two -- when Pike speaks, it's with surprising wit and reserve. Sometimes.

At the same time, Pike and Benny emerge from the theater. They pass Andy and Jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other, almost growling, eyes locked, before pike and Benny turn and walk off, not quite in the direction Grueller took. Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole come out right after. Buffy heads straight for Jeffrey and they kiss massively.

He turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt. WALLY BESSEL is right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead. In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, Wally is freshly undead. He still has fat on his face; in fact, he looks almost normal from afar. But his inhuman eyes and his uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire. And the way he speaks is unearthly. Hollow, almost detached; repeating phrases sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before.

He smiles at Grueller.

Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick. Grueller screams.

Not, by any stretch, an upscale joint. Dark, cramped, and scummy. A young Chinese Whore sits on a bed, wearing little enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her shoulder.

Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home. They're really bombed now.

It is Merrick, the man from the mall. He runs to the side of the wall, looks over. The two are already lost in the dark mist. Merrick turns around, looks about him. He digs in his pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly. While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on the railing. Stake and cross in hand, he stands by Pike looking out at the night.

Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the stake. Buffy watches, immobilized.

INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room. She is startled by someone standing in her path. She almost screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's her mother. She stands, arm akimbo, looking very confrontational. Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably in front of her mother for a moment.

Lothos is beside her.

INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for last night's wear. Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking at his watch pointedly: she's late for class. He moves on. Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>

	Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat.

INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out. She blinks stupidly, looks around. She is lying by a pool of what looks to be dark water in a large cave. Torches burn around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to get up and finds it difficult. She pulls herself up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands. She does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Lothos. He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, the style maybe Nineteenth Century. No blood seems to touch him as he rises. He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy lust.
</DIRECTION>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many. To feel their souls coursing about me.

	Yes, I'm sure they do. This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.

Cassandra turns. Amilyn stands behind her, grinning. He hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What... are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSANDRA>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we so strange? So alien to you? I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming. The perfect place to spread my empire. Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place. It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption. The city of Angels.

</LOTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
He steps right up to her.

<LOTHOS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we? We are man, perfected. We exist to consume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
On the world "to consume" we see Amilyn mouthing the words with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling. He's heard this a hundred times.
</DIRECTION>
<AMILYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? Do we change this one, or do we just drain her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMILYN>
<DIRECTION>
Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, look. My gold card. It's your. I'll never report it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.
</DIRECTION>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has a certain quality, this one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOTHOS>
<DIRECTION>
Amilyn bites the card.
</DIRECTION>
<AMILYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think this is gold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMILYN>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic. Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOTHOS>
<CASSANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful.

</CASSANDRA>
<LOTHOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

<CASSANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swear to God.

He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies. He hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth.

	I wish you wouldn't mention him...

INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grey, dusty and long since abandoned. Sunlight pours in through the large windows, practically caked with dust. Old crates are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or two. Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag. This is definitely not her turf. She runs her finger along a crate, picks up a world of dust. She holds up her finger at Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire the help. No kidding.

Merrick looks up at her.

</MERRICK>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.

</BUFFY>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them.

Gradually, Buffy gets more into the cheer. The steps become more complicated as she repeats the verse.

CLOSEUP - MERRICK'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a knife slip out of Merrick's sleeve. He palms it, hands behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her. She catches it, reflexively, inches from her face. Stops dead. Then bursts into tears. Merrick is thrown off by this reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>

	Oh, what the hell is wrong with you? You threw a knife at my head!

	I don't want to be the chosen one, okay? I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die. It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell. And then you come along... and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!

It floats rapidly at her, hissing. Buffy looks about her frantically, trapped. It hits her at top speed and she instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it against the wall at the end of the alley. As it hits, Buffy, still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it directly at its heart. The stake punctures the startled creature's chest. Before he can so much as grab it, Buffy throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home with her foot. The vampire screams, sinks to the ground.

Pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat-up Dodge, which is filled with all his belongings. ZEPH stands watching him. Zeph is about forty-five, greasy, good-natured. Pike works for him.

<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you'd have the part by two! Christ, it's almost dark.

Pike finishes, slams the hood. He picks up a battered guitar case and stuffs it into the car, shuts the door.

Pike gets in the car. It sputter, starts.

INT. PIKE'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the edge of town. The car has stalled at an intersection. Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to the rasping ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, come on. Don't leave me, baby. Come on, breathe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Amilyn appears in the street in front of the car. Pike finally hears the SCRAPING OF HIS FEET as he approaches the car. Pike straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes INTO THE FRAME, we see there are two more behind him. They are both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny. They all approach, slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for the money, baby. Make me proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life. The headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires. They both go flying, hurt but not killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car. Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly punches through the roof, grabbing at him. He fights off the hand and tries to control the speeding car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It can't be done: he goes off the road and into a park. The car careens along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amilyn ride it, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it. Still fighting, he aims at the branch. It gets closer.

Amilyn looks up.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD. The arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car hits another tree dead on. Pike slams into the steering wheel. The guitar case flies right through the windshield and lands on the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pike pulls himself slowly from the car. He is bleeding, but not badly. Just shaken. He hears a low, seething WAIL from a few yards back and turns around. Amilyn is getting shakily to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, give me a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, clutching what's left of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the other vampires nears him. Pike tries to run and his knees buckle. He lands on them right next to the guitar case. As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head. He hits him again. The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike. Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blasting kick in the head from Buffy. The vampire is flung to one side, falls. He starts up at Buffy and she nails him with a stake. Pike stares at her. She pulls a walkie-talkie from her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
(into walkie-talkie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm on the east side, near the playground... all right.

	It was. I think it's pretty much ready for the --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The last vampire hits Pike from behind. Without missing a beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off. She and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves before she buries the guitar neck in its chest. It falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick runs up. He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker. He is more modern than he was before, but subtly. He sees the decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting.

INT. BOILER ROOM - CLOSEUP ON AMILYN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, banging his one fist on the boiler tank. It booms hollowly. Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<LOTHOS>

	What's wrong with you!?!

	Cheer up. You may still.

Only Lothos smiles at the joke. Amilyn raises his stump, looks at it. The tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of it, but it still isn't good.

He turns toward his chamber.

<LOTHOS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me know about our little recruits. I'll be in my chamber...

On his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum. He plucks a large kitten out of it.

Buffy hands Pike the water and they move back into the living room. Pike curls up in an armchair by the window. Buffy begins stripping off her bloody clothes, leaving on a tank-top and jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>

	Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.

As Buffy strips down to her tank top, she notices a gash on her arm. It's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly impressive. Pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with her shirt.

	I'm sorry, I just mean... well you seemed like such a flake. But, in a good way! I can just keep talking till you strike me dead, or...

Buffy smiles at this, though still upset. She sits down.

	I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's weird. I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. I couldn't even fit on the swings. Everything just looked so small.

The snap. Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey. Jeffrey is way open. He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs. Barber players are rushing at him. And Grueller is coming at him too, throwing other players right and left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey looks a little worried. He bolts down field, toward the end zone, Grueller on his heels.

<DIRECTION>
Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other players. Grueller, hungry with bloodlust, is confused by the exultant crowd, snarling at people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy races for the crowd. She sees Jeffrey is all right. Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands even as everyone else is rushing onto the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey is triumphant. He sees Buffy running for him and raises his arms. She passes him right by and continues after Grueller, heads up the stands. He looks after her, confused, before he is swamped again.

He tries to make his way through the crowd.

ANGLE - TOP OF THE STANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back. Buffy sees him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground. Buffy sails down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down. She swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps. Still holding the broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and sinks the broken end in his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around for Grueller. He is booking out, already several yards away..

Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see Buffy take off after Grueller.

Buffy is still following, but she can't keep up. She spot a BIKER tooling along the street on a Harley. She comes up to the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out. The biker smiles, stops in front of her.

Ground level, behind the bike, we see its engine revving, smoke puffing from twin pipes.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight. Seconds late, Buffy roars into view behind him. She navigates the streets with less ease than determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a violently bumpy and erratic course through the site. She finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the bike. She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has trouble getting up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUFFY'S POV

Grueller's smiling face appears over her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Grueller, God, what did they do you?

</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
He brings his face right next to hers. His voice is no longer passionless; it boils up from hell.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They killed me.

</GRUELLER>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME SCENE

<DIRECTION>
He grabs her and hauls her up.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering back. Before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again. There are two more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Master walks tonight. This is his kingdom, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUELLER>
<DIRECTION>
They rush her. She takes one on as the second hits her, knocking her over. They all three swarm over her, meeting her kicks with raking claws. The two hold her in front of Grueller.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUELLER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Buffy, I've always wanted you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUELLER>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles again and leans toward her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise to him as it is to Buffy. He falls backward, shocked and dead. Behind him stands Pike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs away. Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto Grueller, impaling him as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at his heels.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a series of flips. She lands with her legs around the vampire's shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto Pike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, breathing hard. Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their touching, (and by their slight arousal).

<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Look, Buffy. You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine. But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing. I really do.

Pike drives slowly between the cars. He sees Buffy walking toward the mall. He pulls up by her, parks. Gets out of the car.

</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?

</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this. The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a mixer. It's the senior dance. And it's important. You wouldn't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got that right. I thought you wanted to kill vampires.

	But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have known.

Buffy raises her fist at him; he starts back, involuntarily.

	Leave me alone.

</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benny was right. You guys are all exactly the same.

Buffy walks away, leaving Pike alone.

<DIRECTION>
(continuing; calls after her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not disappointed, I'm just angry.

As Pike walks off, the camera TILTS UP the lamp post behind them. Benny is perched upon it.

Buffy looks at dresses, most of them fairly tight and fairly out there. She holds one in front of her, looks in a mirror.

INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - ANOTHER NIGHT

Pike sits, fiddling with his crossbow. Looks out the window, discontented. Laid out next to him we see wooden shafts, garlic, and a cross.

INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Buffy lays her dress on the bed. We cannot see exactly what it looks like.

INT. THE GYM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party is underway. Streamers everywhere, tables by the windows. Couples dance, a D.J spins the tunes. There is a setup in one corner for taking prom pictures. The kids are all very elegant and hip. Every shade of black is represented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - PUNCH BOWL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting. They are both wearing slinky little black dresses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) and one leading outside. Gary Murray stands by the outside door, on guard, as students enter. He is looking disdainfully at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it came with the tux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy enters the gym. She is wearing a long white strapless gown. It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd. Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress. She enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey. She passes Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buffy! Looking tasty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Have you seen Jeffrey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
But Andy has moved on. Buffy works her way through the crowd to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly. They stop whispering real quick.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you guys seen Jeffrey? The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.

</BUFFY>

Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>

	I haven't seen him tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

She picks up a glass of punch.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you guys are here. It's good to see you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, whoops I came.

<BUFFY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look way pretty, Kim.

</BUFFY>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I like your little outfit.

</KIMBERLY>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as there's room for three in it. What, didn't you bring your new friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy is startled by this attack. Nicole giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you guys are mad at me. I'm sorry. I've been really --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeffrey suddenly appears between them. Jennifer is on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeffrey! There you are. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, as everybody assesses the situation. Buffy is shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt. Jeffrey is uncomfortable. Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment. Kimberly is in serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buffy, what are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were meeting here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here with Jenny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
-- who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm like a dog on a leash.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what's going on. It's not working out at all. I've got to move on. I mean, I've got needs, too. I told you about all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you didn't. When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you get my message?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You broke up with my machine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't home. Like always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left me a message?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out of here. Jenny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch on Buffy's chest. She flees, Jeffrey in tow. They leave the gym. Kimberly finds it all pretty funny. Nicole is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy turns away, toward the wall. A soft BALLAD come on over the SPEAKERS. Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as she wipes futilely at her dress. Finally she turns, looks toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUFFY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pike is there, walking in on his own. He wears a leather jacket and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced Doc Martins. He looks great.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I crashed your party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty shallow of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you came.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on Buffy's dress. He looks about him a bit, then without hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains. Buffy smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
They begin slow dancing, not too close.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
They dance for a while, closer and closer.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; gee-whizzically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you're not like the other girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
We see couples dancing, kissing... Gary Murray watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - KIMBERLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy dance disdainfully.
</DIRECTION>
<KIMBERLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMBERLY>
<DIRECTION>
The window SHATTERS by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for her. She screams, starts back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around. A couple of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the situation. They vaguely herd to the middle of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - BUFFY AND PIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking around, assessing the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - OUTER DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOODY_STUDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're out there! They're vampires! God, help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOODY_STUDENT>
<DIRECTION>
He falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway. Nobody moves for a second. Then one of the students starts toward the body.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go near the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<1ST_VAMPIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's party time.

</1ST_VAMPIRE>

	I already invited them.

Everyone looks at her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They're seniors!

<DIRECTION>
Pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of small stakes he has made, hands them to Buffy. She opens her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - INSIDE THE PURSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cosmetics, hair spray, etc. She fits the stakes in.

</GARY_MURRAY>
<DIRECTION>
But other students have picked up the cry, are clamoring to sacrifice Buffy. Pike crosses to his bag, sitting by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two guys move toward Buffy, Andy intervenes. Pike steps in front of Buffy, holding his custom made cartridge-load crossbow. Trains it on the others. They quiet down.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's gotta be a back way out of here, or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy looks at the partygoers. Her friends. They stare back at her, scared, angry. She looks out the door. Back at her friends.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out the front.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart.

</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're staying here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(before he can speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.

</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say that like it's a bad thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy looks at her a moment, moves off. Buffy goes to Pike's bag, starts pulling out stakes.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thing one of us was prepared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy stands up. She kisses Pike very hard on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't piss me off.

She kneels down, begins to rip the hem of her dress.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the doorway to the gym. A mist has risen around the entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand clustered about it. Some have keen and eager expressions, some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust. They wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out. Buffy. Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees. She wears Pike's leather jacket over it. She wears her purse strapped across her chest under the jacket. In one hand she holds his crossbow; in her other hand is a cross. As she steps further away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts behind her.

Survivors say some two hundred of the ruffians laid the school gym under a kind of siege, claiming several lives in the process. Said one administrator, 'Things here will never be the same.'

SHOT FROM ABOVE, the blue water FILLING THE SCREEN. Kimberly dives gracefully into it, comes up on the other side.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kim climbs out and joins Jeffrey, Jennifer and a boy and girl we don't know. They are all in bathing gear, with fluorescent zinc on their noses.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was even crazier after that. I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.

</JENNIFER>
<KIMBERLY>

	Buffy?

</KIMBERLY>

Jennifer nods. Kimberly wrinkles her nose in distaste.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school. All year. She didn't even go to the prom.

EXT. A COURTYARD - LATE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward us. We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, hills in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy leads the way. She is confident, at ease. She wears a large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward. Skirt and sneakers. Casual, cool, but disarming. She carries a knapsack.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off. We could maybe wait till later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be such a fraidy-cat.

<PIKE>

	Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<BUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've come all this way. We just have to check it out. I got a hunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUFFY>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the boss, boss. I just thought maybe we should wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy stops at a large, elaborately carved door. She turns to Pike.

<BUFFY>

	Trust me.

ANGLE - DOOR KNOCKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buffy grabs the large metal knocker, ringed through a gargoyle's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And on the boom of the knocker, we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE - THE CASTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The castle. Archetypal, turreted, terrifying. Standing lonely on the craggy hill, drenched in the light of the rising moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
