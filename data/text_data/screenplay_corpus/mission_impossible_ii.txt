Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent Natural History Museum. They are moving in and around an odd freeform sculpture.

on the belt that takes it thru X-Ray. On the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, hi-tech and at odds with the other items. She pulls out an urn- shaped vessel.

COMPUTERIZED SCREEN DISPLAY

</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- folks, we're a little over two and a half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but if you look out your windows on either side of the aircraft, we'll soon be crossing the southern section of the Rocky Mountains, a range which includes more than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet. The chain's loftiest point, Mount Elbert, at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view as we pass over central Colorado shortly..

INT. CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEKHORVICH seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance. He checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending seconds whipping by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat beside Nekhorvich.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..

Nekhorvich is overcome. Ethan puts a comforting hand on his shoulder:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was quite a man. Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NEKHORVICH>

	Yes, he knew. Just..

<ETHAN>

<DIRECTION>
Nekhorvich pats the satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You carry them together? Safely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
With an almost impish grin and a wink:
</DIRECTION>
<NEKHORVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and you'll get us to a safe place with them, thank god!..left to my own devices, I'm an old fart too inept to read a railroad timetable!..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEKHORVICH>
<DIRECTION>
Good-natured laughter. Cut off by a flight steward who passes by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction. Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling. Passengers are puzzled and alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Captain again. We've experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A passenger struggling with his mask. As Nekhorvich fumbles with the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping. He checks the countdown time on his watch again. Nekhorvich looks around him. The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.

The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands slip off the controls. His eyes flutter, then:

<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, I don't..can't..
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
He passes out. The Captain, HUGH STAMP, turns to verify that the relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls.

He then removes his oxygen mask, sets the auto pilot, inputting numbers to slow the plane and descend. As the craft titles downward...

	..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nekhorvich's eyes narrow.
</DIRECTION>
<NEKHORVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not Dmitri?

With a lightning swift move Ethan breaks Nekhorvich's neck.

<DIRECTION>
Ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane. Stamp pulls back the panel, hops into the compartment below which is four walls of electronic equipment. Stamp kneels and slides back the floor hatch. The wind howls, puffs of cloud zip by beneath them. As they descend into the belly:

They don goggles and, with Ambrose in the lead, the team leaps, one after another from the hatch, sailing off into the sky.

INT. - COCKPIT (DAY)

An automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrain, terrain. Pull up, pull up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The co-pilot stirs. He blearily rouses himself just in time to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mountain rushing toward him. As mountain meets airplane, the frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, which ignited, lights a fuse..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going. Aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below. Ethan climbs out of shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan into shot. Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday. It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on the soundtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again. As he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan. Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him. But when its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his climb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAIRY OVERHANG near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below. He's clinging to the mountain almost like a fly walking on the ceiling. When he reaches for a handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of feet to oblivion.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoaa..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT

with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the summit. He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude. To lizard:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back attracts his attention. He turns to see the source of the beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo streamer. Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of the copter. With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears. Ethan has opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.

Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit. Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his back-pack. Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries of flamenco dancers.

DISSOLVE TO:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets. The dancers perform on a raised platform and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the crowed party. Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman. Nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one another. Ethan approaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know me?

</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Should I?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You just looked as if you did.

<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Just as if I'd like to.

</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.

</ETHAN>

	Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -

</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
This stops her. Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose to nose. Whispered but breezy:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I pay the rent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.

</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink then:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go find the wealthy lady you came with and next time we meet - I'll pay your rent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing him, sweetly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now bugger off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of the dancer's steps to cover her own. Once upstairs, a security guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to Ethan. In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following. In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah. Ethan smiles, moves out of shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. - BATH (EVE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored walls. The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice. Nyah can't resist. She spoons a dollop of the caviar and downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to its back. There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, revealing an electronic density meter. She turns it on and holds it at the rear of the tub. Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(her fondest hopes confirmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the tiles just above the sop dish. Her knee eyes search for any cracks in the grout and she spots one. Using a tweezers she pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles. She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble casing out from the rear of the tub. Nyah breathes a sigh of relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked compartments. As she studies them:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Decisions, decisions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(not altogether pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. You're not just another pretty face..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god. A bloody baritone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror. She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the tub, pulling him down on top of her. Once again they're nose to nose.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it you prefer tenors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances up at the mirror. In it is the reflection of SENOR AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it. He breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and disappears from the dressing room mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind if I'm on top?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, either way works for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara brush. She glances down and is rather disconcerted. Continues working with the pick and wrench.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're never gonna find it there.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes up for auction Tuesday.

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's lower pelvic region as she straddles him. Not exactly in the mood to move:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stiffens - he knows too damn much.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- right..where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the bottom right compartment. She's utterly nonplussed:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the bloody -

</NYAH>
<ETHAN>

	Hey, you put me here. I just do what I'm told.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- right..

She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque wrench and carbide pick - and it's open. She withdraws a velvet pouch and opens the pouch. Out spills the spectacular necklace.

The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in.
</DIRECTION>
<SENOR_DE_L_ARENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Spanish to security guards, annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENOR_DE_L_ARENA>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is that the heat sensors were activated. But Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate -

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SENOR_DE_L_ARENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mucho gusto, senorita.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENOR_DE_L_ARENA>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- did feel that she had rather too long to work on the safe before they triggered the alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes. Absolutely. Much too long I should yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary, intensified curiosity - about Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load. How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer. we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow. Shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He offers Nyah his arm. They start out. Ethan immediately stops.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah looking genuinely puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The necklace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.
</DIRECTION>
<SENOR_DE_L_ARENA>
<DIRECTION>
(a great kidder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you trying to do, senorita? Rob me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENOR_DE_L_ARENA>

They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue. Ethan and Nyah emerge from the villa, walking slowly. Nyah's clearly preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace. Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you walked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say something, no offence? You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working under adverse conditions. Highly adverse conditions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds smashing. I'm in. Muchacho, mi carro, por favor! Now be serious. You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..

</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't do that badly.

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Her car arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(as she moves to her car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(opening the car door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really. I triggered the alarm..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
One foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, the Bulgari job last week was flawless. And I've always been partial to pale yellows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
She slides behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(as he leads on the car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't do laundry, or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territory so they can poach on mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake. Ethan smiles and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD - NYAH (MOVING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
around curves, hair flying, she's free. Her car phone rings. Perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(tentatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hola..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Would you mind slowing down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get this number? I don't even have it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She hits the End button and disconnects. The phone immediately rings again. She refuses to pick up. Ethan pulls alongside hers. She looks at him. They speak through the open cars.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your help? What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh bloody hell. You're a spy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
She floors it and shoots ahead of Ethan, nicking his car as she takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I deserved that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF DRIVING SHOTS - NYAH AND ETHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan rings her again. And keeps ringing. Her face becomes grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethan's pursuit progressively more determined. They are reaching the limits of adhesion around blind curves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank and sees on his GPS what Nyah can't see thru the fog - less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of feet to rock and sea below. Ringing her number again:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(half to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow down, slow down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns up a mound and loses control. She spins out and heads toward the edge of the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing she's in trouble)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin. Her car stops just at the cliff's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's no Nyah. Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet below, holding the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh..oh..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Taking a firm grip on her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look down. Just..look at me. That's it..that's it..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into his arms. For a long moment it looks like she's in shock. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's you name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ethan Hunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan. Her dark eyes suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...more than I thought..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
They scarcely to move to bring their lips together:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awfully short notice..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care to wait a decent interval?

INT./EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ETHAN sleeping. His eyes open slowly. He comes to full consciousness, his head still on the pillow. Something approaching serious anxiety informs his features. He lifts his head and looks at his left, angle widening. Nyah lies on her side facing him, sleeping serenely. Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't- approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed. He lets his head flop back on the pillow. Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to- profile. As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced by curiosity and even wonder. He lifts his hand and just brushes her cheek. Her eyes open. She knows where she is.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what've you got against spooks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they've got your recruiting technique? Not a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've got a book for this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've got a book for everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He'd lie about his favorite color. But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard. All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the point. In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That they're lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..once they know that they can get very very..crosee..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where did I got right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..this thing these blokes pinched..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah stops to think about this.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, what I am I doing here? I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do I. Sort of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nyah laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask a question, you get an answer!..

</NYAH>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, you're beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<NYAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because I'm on my back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
She sinks into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema portion of the Fallas de Valencia. On this night great papier mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the city and torched in great bonfires. Outside the bar Ethan's looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and flowers. He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going to buy some flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be seen on the petals. Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar, and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet. Turns back to the vendor.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna be here a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<VENDOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si, senor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VENDOR>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pick'em up on my way out, okay?

Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where he passes security at a pair of double doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. - IMF BRIEFING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swanbeck stands looking out the window. Noisy crowds from the festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid background thru briefing room's window.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fetival's a pain in the ass. Honoring saint by setting'em on fire.

Ethan sits.

	Let's you know what they think of saints, doesn't it? Damn near set me on fire on my way over here. As if I haven't been burned enough today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is going to blow between these two. Then civilly:
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I barged in on your vacation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be. Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. You're sorry and I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you phrase it like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta be kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD, and projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH
</DIRECTION>
<NEKHORVICH>
<DIRECTION>
(with exaggerate brio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Dmitri! How are you?..

Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply. Ethan smiles.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine and you're fine..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
With Ethan simultaneously whispering:
</DIRECTION>
<NEKHORVICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine too.. I'm fine and you're fine - do you remember, dear fried, how you got Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr. Strangelove and we gave you the name of that silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know your name?..In those days, you not only saved our lives, you saved our sanity. 'Now, then Dmitri - we have this little problem': Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires; a villain. Therefore, in a search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster Chimera. I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately. However we travel, I must arrive at me destination, within 20 hours of departure. Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for now prudence dictates that I communicate nothing but the gravest urgency. I fear I can entrust this to no one but you, Dmitri. as we say, 'I'm sorry and you're sorry'..
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEKHORVICH>
<DIRECTION>
Swanbeck stops the DVD.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you something. You have any idea what the hell he's talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An idea, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. So let's get on with it. He's still in Sydney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead. So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan sits back, heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- Hunt, are you listening?..
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly looking up:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Swanbeck clears his throat. He turns back to the computer and punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE. File open to computer scans of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat, as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slowly looks up at Swanbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two, three times?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you think of him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not necessarily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Airline record list Captain Harold Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207. as far as the media and all governmental agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the flight, but in fact he missed it. He did, however make the next flight - in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone on that flight planned an operation designed to down the plane and make it look like an accident. Someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch but - they don't always get your luggage on the plane, even when you fly first class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you do think it was Ambrose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan barely nods.

<SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you're not surprised.

</SWANBECK>

Ethan gives Swanbeck a look.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>

Ethan smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The question is why? What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan rises and moves to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now only Ambrose knows that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- right. In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>

Wallis breaks hard, but not hard enough: he stops just in the path of an oncoming 18-wheeler. His car's demolished.

EXT. - ROADWAY - ETHAN AND SUV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan pulls out of the smoke as the SUV bursts out of the scrub behind him, striking the rear of the cycle. Ethan puts his bike into a spin and pulls his gun, ending up alongside the SUV passenger window. He fires through the window, shooting both Michael and the bodyguard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUV veers off, crashing into a line of parked cars. It hits the first car and flips up and over, landing upside down on several more parked cars. Ethan speeds off on his smoking cycle. Ambrose arrives and then takes a side road.

moving up behind Nyah who is walking purposefully to the edge of the bluff and a precipitous drop to rocks and surf a hundred and fifty feet below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera drops to Nyah's shoulder level and moves with her to the bluff's edge. As she's just a few steps away from stepping off, there's a roar and the helicopter rises into the shot, before her wild-eyed Billy gesturing, 'Stop! Stop!' to Nyah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. - ROADWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan passes narrowly between a car and oncoming truck. Ambrose follows as soon as the truck clears. Ethan fires backward using his side-view mirror to aim, exploding Ambrose's windscreen. Ambrose skids until his wheel clips a rock, knocking him upright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub. Back on the main road, Ambrose roars off to intercept Ethan.

EXT. - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan and Ambrose round a bend and face one another. Without hesitating, they charge towards each other. As they near one another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide hard in mid-air. They fall to the ground fighting as their bikes skid and Ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan and Ambrose rush towards one another. Ethan flips Ambrose to the ground. Ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster. As Ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off a 30-foot cliff.

Ethan and Ambrose rise from the fall. Ethan jumps up and sweeps Ambrose, dropping him to the ground. Ethan begins strangling Ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, Ambrose gets Ethan in a choke hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits Ethan in the midsection and the face. Ethan kicks it out of his hand and connects with several punches, knocking Ambrose to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts Ethan across the back and face. Ambrose dives on Ethan and the knife is poised above Ethan's eye before Ethan grabs the knife and clears, holding it out toward Ambrose.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Use it Hunt. It's not a bad way to go. A lot better than the way that bitch is going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing. Ethan steps back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand.

EXT. - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan turns and walks away from Ambrose toward the cliff edge. The copter lands and Luther runs toward Ethan but pulls up, looking over Ethan's shoulder. Ambrose has a gun aimed at Ethan's back.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hunt. You should have killed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by dust from the copter. Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air. He catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.

INT. - CULTURAL MUSEUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Didgeridoo music. A child admires a painting. Swanbeck and Ethan face one another. A long, long pause. For a moment it appears as if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence.
</DIRECTION>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it was. Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there. You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days. At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.

	Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus. Not even antibodies.

</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I gathered as much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By fire. That's the best way, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>

Ethan doesn't respond.

	It's no longer enough for you to execute and implement IMF policy, you now wish to go in the business of creating it?

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. But in this case -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In this case, it wasn't a bad idea. In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it. And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged. I'm assuming you approve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.

</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?

	I don't. No exactly.

</ETHAN>
<SWANBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Hunt, what are your plans?

</SWANBECK>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

	Right. Just remember, mates. Billy Baird's the name. Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.

And Billy's gone. Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant to say anything, both reluctant to leave.
</DIRECTION>

One quick bear hug, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always nice hearing from you man. Stay in touch..
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
And Luther's off. Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully. Then, curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd. After a half- dozen steps, something catches his eyes. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One quick bear hug, then:
</DIRECTION>
<NYAH>
<DIRECTION>
(a tad wary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know me?

</NYAH>
<DIRECTION>

She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable conviction.

<ETHAN>

	<DIALOGUE>

</ETHAN>
<NYAH>

He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for hers.

Looks around at the swirling crowd:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the crowd. Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:
