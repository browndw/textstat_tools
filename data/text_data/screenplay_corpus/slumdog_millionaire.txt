An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes. Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other side.

A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage. Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem Kumar.

INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. His head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has he confessed, yet?

Constable Srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips on Jamal's fingers. The Inspector stares, deep in thought. Sweat trickles down his face. He wipes it away with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself.

The Inspector nods absently to Constable Srinivas who turns a handle. Jamal's body pulsates and jerks. He screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes over to Jamal.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTOR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Were you wired up? A mobile or a pager, correct? Some little hidden gadget? No? A coughing accomplice in the audience? Microchip under the skin, huh?

Constable Srinivas hadn't thought of that. Grabs Jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until the Inspector has had enough.

</INSPECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jamal doesn't answer. The Inspector sighs and sits down. Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers in front of Jamal's face to check for a response.

EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air. The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jamal! Catch it! Catch it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIM>
<DIRECTION>
The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks around trying to get into position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his feet.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes that run in between the shacks of the slum.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Private-ka land! Private-ka land! The planes won't kill you, mader chod, I will!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off, head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JUHU SLUM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are three feet wide, with an open drain running down the middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the shacks have been built right over the paths, turning them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be lost and frightened in minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But these children are natives and with the practice of many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of lanes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dodge past people cooking in the doorways, sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim shouts a warning.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vinod! Musketeers coming through!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIM>
<DIRECTION>
Without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people, stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here, drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food, playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out into sunlight again.

Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of shouting, roaring.

He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in a pair of pants runs after them.

Even before the train has stopped, men are jumping from the open doors, or vaulting out of the windows or from the roof of the train to join the tens of thousands of Mumbaites streaming to and from work. A seventeen-year old Jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves through the crowds. He checks the time. The digital numerals flick to five O'clock. Looks around the tide of humanity.

The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the descending river of people out of his way, the eighteen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her: the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

Blazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks, Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares. Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who waves, pulls up in the dump. "Hope Orphanage is written on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around.

Standing next to Salim, Latika giggles. Immediately, Salim is on her. Before a fight breaks out, Punnoose pulls Salim off Latika and hurls him across the room. Salim gets up and charges at Punnoose.

Surrounded by beer bottles, Punnoose is slumped asleep by the kitchen door. Latika edges past, avoids the cook sleeping under the table and goes to a shelf laden with vegetables. She pulls down a bunch of chillies still on the vine, strips a few off and tip-toes out with them.

Sleeping children, three or four to a mattress on the floor. Latika tip-toes around the mattresses. She pauses over one in particular where we see Salim, asleep. She carefully pulls up the sheet, delves underneath. Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face for a second. Then suddenly, he is bolt upright and screaming. He charges around the room clutching his genitals in agony.

In a shack, Arvind is singing one of Surdas' bhajans in front of Maman and an old man who by his ragged appearance must be a villager. Punnoose and Salim sit behind Arvind.

<DIRECTION>
Maman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round, Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it. Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb. Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with the cloth nods to Punnoose.

Utterly bemused, Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay Arvind on the table. The villager takes hold of Arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. He brings the spoon close. Suddenly, Salim is being sick in the corner of the shack. By the time he has turned back, the villager is wiping the spoon on a blood-soaked rag.

Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall into holes. The three children are running. Branches smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing will stop them.

They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his hand.

INT/ EXT. FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE. MORNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A middle class Indian couple with their three children are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave, she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle, Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting. Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion. Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-
</DIRECTION>

Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian Man. A middle-aged American couple also get out. Jamal points them down a lane which opens out on India's largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating clothes on stone slabs.

He gets out his video camera and wanders towards the dhobi ghat. Behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up. Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the Taj leap out.

Salim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot- wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the fire.

Jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked. It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye- less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He turns and bows low, putting his hands together.

EXT. PILA STREET. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark, crowded streets. Gangs of women stand outside the doorways or lean out of upstairs windows. They are garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to 60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities, exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them something, as the women either shrug or offer them something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows. But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from the group.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They go into one of the tiny houses. Loud Filmi music comes from upstairs. They are confronted by a woman in her fifties watching tv. She is less than interested.
</DIRECTION>

The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's still not on the menu. Choose someone else or piss off.

</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Jamal pulls out some rupee notes.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just two minutes to talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the money, counts it.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She nods upwards. Salim and Jamal head up the dark, tiny staircase. The Woman picks up the phone on her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LANDING. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the tiny landing, Salim and Jamal pull back a curtain to reveal a humping couple. They move on, past more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex, not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They reach the end of the landing. From the other side of the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika; though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing, turquoise, silk sari.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it her or not?

Then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard on Latika's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DANCE_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile! Flow, flow! You entice with the hands not make chapattis, you gawaar. Again.

<JAMAL>

</JAMAL>
<DIRECTION>
Latika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<MAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who we have here, Punnoose. Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never forget a face. Especially one that I own.

<SALIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maman never forgets. Isn't that right?

</SALIM>
<MAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Maman can make an exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Salim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't take that risk, Maman. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIM>
<DIRECTION>
He wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot. Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up, giggles stupidly.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Safety catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIM>
<DIRECTION>
Shrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the floor, grabs Maman's wallet. Jamal just stands.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIM>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHOWPATTY BEACH. DUSK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Children are splashing in the sea, flying kites, digging sand, laughing. Salim, Latika and Jamal are crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the sea. Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from a bottle of Johnny Walker.

A very wobbly Latika, Salim and Jamal walk up the frozen escalators of the empty hotel, lit only by security lights. Kick through the odd pile of rubbish and stacked-up chairs. Go to the dusty reception desk.

Leaden skies. Torrential rain is hammering on the tin roofs of the slum.

INT. SHACK. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eighteen year-old Jamal's eyes open. Now with the beginnings of a beard and moustache, Jamal wakes in a tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor. He pulls on a shirt, lifts the mattress and takes out his trousers which have been pressing there all night, puts them over his shoulder, picks up his shoes and goes down a ladder.
</DIRECTION>

He descends into a room and two feet of water that is eddying around the ground floor of the shack. Wades out of the door into the narrow lane of the slum.

INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
We are confronted with a room you could swing a Boeing in. Rows and rows of Operators in tiny booths stretch into the distance. On the walls are pictures of London, Tony Blair, red telephone boxes, the Yorkshire Dales, the Highlands- a snapshot of tourist Britain. Huge posters of soap stars and celebrities adorn the rest of the walls. Slogans hang from the ceiling. "When the sun comes up, you'd better be running", "you snooze, you lose", "Upgrade for a better, faster life." "Every call is a new opportunity".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each section of the room has a banner with a British city's name on it and various mock sign-posts for the different aisles. A Manager under the banner "Bradford", is standing over an Operator, listening in on a call. The Manager leans over and presses a key.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>

Dave heads off towards a Rest and Recreation room, where a big plasma screen on the wall is showing "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."Jamal grabs the jacket from the back of Dave's chair, puts the head-set on and hunches over the booth, just another Operative at work. We become aware that every operator down the Cornmarket aisle- and quite a few other aisles besides- is staring in the direction of the Rest and Recreation Room.

Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik. Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up.

INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the descending river of people out of his way, the seventeen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her: the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Latika! Latika!

But though he is screaming her name, his voice is swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

<DIRECTION>
Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one figure against an army of white-robed people. He gets to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against the tide. But so are the two men. Jamal is now on the same platform. Shouts her name again. She turns with a smile. But the two Thugs leap through a train onto her platform. She sees them, starts running, is lost in the crowd. Jamal runs off along the platform after Latika.

Latika is jumping the tracks, crossing in front of trains. But the Thugs are gaining on her. He brings her down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes. Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the car.

Javed glances up at the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is staring, wide-eyed at the tv.
