:SC: THE HEBREW HAMMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over BLACK, we hear the first few bars of Jingle Bells. The music morphs into an OMINOUS SCORE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a thunderous BOOM, comes a TITLE CARD reading "HANUKKAH PAST."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX, and then violently CRANE down to reveal MORDECHAI (10), a timid little Hasidic boy standing nervously at the foot of the statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase "HANUKKAH IS 4 HOMOS" scrawled across it. He clutches his Sandy Koufax lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school. Superimposed over the picture are the words, "ST. PETER, PAUL, AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mordechai takes a deep breath, and walks towards the school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR GENTILE CHILDREN.
</DIRECTION>
<GENTILE_BOY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a penny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTILE_BOY_1>
<DIRECTION>
He drops a penny. The other children cackle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels.
</DIRECTION>
<GENTILE_GIRL_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTILE_GIRL_1>
<DIRECTION>
Gentile Boy 1 feigns choking.
</DIRECTION>
<GENTILE_BOY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTILE_BOY_2>
<DIRECTION>
More laughter. Morty attempts to take it all in stride. We PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2, a severe looking puritanically dressed child as she turns to face the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<GENTILE_GIRL_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Morty, my mom says that unless your people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior you're all going to burn in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTILE_GIRL_2>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence. The other children exchange "Now that went a little over the line" looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL. Morty gathers himself, and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear a tinny version of the song Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a DREIDEL. He looks at his gift, and then looks off-screen. We PAN with his look to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of Christian children congregating around a large, garishly decorated Christmas tree. A very Vegas Merry Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version of the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares. The children festively slap high fives as they open their presents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with his brand new ATC motorbike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1. She wears an "I Love Jesus" T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow affixed to its head in her arms. It licks her on the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut back to Mordechai. He looks down at his pathetic excuse for a present. He's on the verge of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC.
</DIRECTION>
<GENTILE_BOY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey everybody! Look what Mordechai got. Nice spinning top Morty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENTILE_BOY_1>
<DIRECTION>
The other children take notice of Mordechai's gift and begin to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mordechai is crushed. MRS. HIGHSMITH (40's), an incredibly Waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'Modern W.A.S.P.,' and appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has weathered. She walks over to comfort him.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HIGHSMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, now class let's not make fun of Mordechai's spinning top. We need to all learn the importance of tolerance and understanding. Isn't that right Mordechai?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HIGHSMITH>
<MORDECHAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes Mrs. Highsmith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORDECHAI>
<MRS_HIGHSMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So class, in honor of Mordechai's special day, I'd like for all of us to wish Morty a heartfelt Merry...

She looks to Mordechai for confirmation on the word.

	Cha-noo-kuh Day 7.

<DIRECTION>
In unison, the class attempts to repeat the words, but all suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HIGHSMITH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good class. I hope you've all learned an important lesson today. Just because Mordechai's people are different from us...just because they might appear strange to us with their furry hats, their beady eyes, and their long sideburns...not to mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny sounding names...just because they control all of the worlds' money, yet are too cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for presents, does not mean that we can't learn to respect and love them as our equals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HIGHSMITH>
<DIRECTION>
She squeezes his cheek.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GHETTO STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sullen Mordechai wanders the streets. Absurd XMAS DECORATIONS, horrific in their appearance blanket the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morty glances a GROTESQUE FAUX REINDEER with fangs. We hear a growling noise as it lights up. He walks quickly away in fear past...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STOREFRONT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We track with Morty as he passes a storefront window. Inside, the CLERK turns a sign outwards reading, "JEWS NOT WELCOME." We continue with Morty as he passes by a second storefront. A similar sign reading, "KYKES GO HOME" is turned outwards by ANOTHER CLERK. He continues past yet another building as a sign reading, "MONOTHEISTS NEED NOT APPLY" is displayed by a THIRD CLERK for Morty's benefit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morty looks across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign hangs from a storefront reading "JEWS OK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES." The FOURTH CLERK gives him the thumbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and pulls out his dreidel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins it, and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats as Morty stares at in wonderment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame and smashes the little dreidel. Mordechai slowly looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A menacing SANTA CLAUS gives him the finger, and exits frame as we hear him sadistically laugh O.S. the words "Ho, ho, ho" at Morty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start CLOSE on Mordechai. Rage fills every inch of his face. As we SLOWLY CRANE AWAY, the opening CREDITS begin as the HEBREW HAMMER THEME SONG kicks into full gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Jewxploitation music pumps, metallic slashes rip through the screen line by line, spinning into place to form a Star Of David. The title, "The Hebrew Hammer" SLAMS into frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE CARD: HANUKKAH PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start CLOSE on a gift wrapped Hanukkah present. We pull back a bit as MORDECHAI JEFFERSON CARVER (29), AKA THE HEBREW HAMMER, a baaad Jewish brother spins the package in his hands as he saunters down the street past a latke stand. He's a Semitic super stud straight out of a 70's Blaxploitation flick. He tosses the gift to MACCABEE, a young Hasidic boy.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy Hanukkah Maccabee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift - a Hebrew Hammer action figure. He beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut back to the Hammer as he smiles back. From O.C., we hear Maccabee say...
</DIRECTION>
<MACCABEE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks Hammer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACCABEE>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer smiles back and walks off frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE CHOOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin on the Hammer's black boots and slowly TILT up as we DOLLY back with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer passes a line of THREE JEWISH PRINCESSES who swoon as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads, "100% KOSHER MEAT." We PUSH into his CLOSE UP as he blows them all a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer winks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a second story flat.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now. God willing, you should settle down and marry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
We punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer takes stock of the goods. She is an atrociously ugly girl wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair oversized librarian's glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but right now G dash d's the only one for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>

Some TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke belonging to SHLOMO, another young Hasidic kid.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TEENAGE_GENTILE>
<DIRECTION>
TEDDY (the non-speaking teen Gentile) throws the yarmulke, and we FOLLOW it as it spins towards another TEENAGE GENTILE. The other Teenage Gentile excitedly extends his hands to catch, but right before it reaches him another hand comes into frame and snatches it. He looks up, and we cut to his...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer. He looks pretty damn big and pissed off from this angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Teenage Gentile begins to shake and stammer.

EXT. 'HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS' OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer walks up the stairs and past the sign advertising his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer theme music winds down, punctuated with Shaft-like brass hits. However, the brass hits become incredibly overblown and extraneous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer walks back into frame from the stairway to his office. He looks around strangely for the source of the music.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTA_CLAUS>
<DIRECTION>
As Santa speaks, we begin on a painting of a meek and frightened looking Santa Claus. His eyes look fearfully to his right. Below the picture frame is a plaque reading "St. Nick the Nervous. 1871-1941", we continue a slow DOLLY to the right on to the next picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see another Santa Claus, much more treacherous in his appearance. His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of Santa to his left. The plaque below his picture read, "St. Nick The Nasty 1941-1970."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We continue our DOLLY to the right, finally ending on a painting of a jolly, portly Santa. Below his picture the plaque reads, "St. Nick The Nice. 1970-Christmas Present."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room. The same nice Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of ELVES. Two reindeer flank Santa on either side. Their nameplates hang from their necks - "BLITZEN" and "RUDOLPH."

At the other end of the table from Santa sits his son DAMIAN, quite a nasty looking man.

	My father, often referred to as St. Nick The Nasty, was a tyrannical man. He was obsessed with making Christmas the only holiday anyone could celebrate before the New Year. Since his death, I've prided myself on ensuring that the Christmas season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and religions. It's always been my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa deserve the same respect as Christmas.

	It was nearly a decade ago, in conjunction with our friends in the Jewish and African American communities that I supported a bill that mandated that 'Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'I'm dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa' be taught and sung in elementary schools along with the Christmas standards 'Frosty The Snowman', and 'Deck The Halls.' Which is why upon examination of my annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son, Damian...

For all the Gentiles reading, I thought I might digress for just a moment. JEWISH MOTHER (adj.)

We DOLLY into the Hammer as he pushes open the WESTERN STYLE doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC comes to a SCREECHING STOP. We HOLD ON HIS CU as he looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to the other side to get a look at what he sees - A bar of about TEN SKINHEADS staring back at him dumbfounded. Skinhead paraphernalia adorns the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer maintains his cool, takes a deep breath, and then walks towards the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to a FLOOR LEVEL shot as his STAR OF DAVID SPURS jangle as he continues his walk to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps up to the counter, where a SKINHEAD BARTENDER with a Manson-like swastika inked on his forehead studies him curiously.

The bartender reaches for a bottle of cherry flavored Manischewitz wine. The Hammer interrupts him by clearing his throat.

	Actually, can I have the black label?

The Bartender eyeballs him, and then grabs the bottle of Black Label Manischewitz. He grabs a glass from the rack, and begins to pour.

With one swift motion, the Hammer spins the bottle up to grab it by the neck, and thwacks the bartender on the head with it.
</DIRECTION>

All of the OTHER OCCUPANTS in the bar jump out of their seats, encircling the Hammer.

We do a QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he pulls out TWO SAWED OFF SHOTGUNS from underneath his coat.

A WIDE SHOT of the bar. The camera is STATIONARY. We hear the sound of SHOTGUNS BLASTING and then the sounds of intense FIGHTING. A few seconds of the fighting sounds pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the front doors bust open and a few bloodied Skinheads fall out onto the ground, followed by the Hammer. He's untouched, and he carries the bottle of Manischewitz in one hand and a shotgun in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops in the MIDGROUND, and pours the Manischewitz out on the astroturf lawn in a methodical manner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches FOREGROUND, and pulls out something from his jacket pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a CU of the same matchbook the elf gave him. "DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. We hear the sounds of bursting flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past the camera.

We pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn.

Curtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys in an a alley. The SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THIRDS as we see CU's of each character smiling. Stills are constantly replaced in time with the music. We see a still of MONEY BEING EXCHANGED, then HANDS BEING SHAKEN.

Things definitely seem odd. The Hammer looks out his left window. TWO Hasidic CHILDREN decorate a giant Christmas tree on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to his right. A GROUP of HASIDIC kids sing Christmas Carols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer looks through his front windshield. A kid is standing right in the middle of the road!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just inches from the kid. It's Shlomo (remember the kid the Hammer helped with the Yarmulke earlier?), and he has a strange glazed look in his eyes. Shlomo holds a videocassette in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer steps out of the Caddy, leaving his car door open. We hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound.

	Back it up buddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<DIRECTION>
He does. The entire crowd of children can now see what's happening. Hushed, fearful whispers. MC Hammer steps out of line and pleads...
</DIRECTION>
<MC_HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please Hammer, don't hurt em'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC_HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer does a double take. MC Hammer gives a "Did I just say that?" expression.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's do this clean. I don't want to make a scene Santa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a bit too late for that now, isn't it? Excuse me children, if I could have your attention for a moment.

<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?

</HAMMER>
<SANTA>

	I'm just calming the kiddies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To children)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTA>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer plays along, raising his hand to keep the children calm.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?

</HAMMER>
<SANTA>

	In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.

<DIRECTION>
AN EMPTY SECTION OF THE MALL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked portion of the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Esther and the Hammer haul ass around the corner, running for their lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second or two pass, and an ANGRY MOB of about twenty Gentile children round the corner after them. They're definitely not in the Christmas spirit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer and Esther take another turn. From the other direction a SECOND MOB OF CHILDREN head straight at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer spots another corridor in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
They run about a hundred yards before they hit a wall. A dead end! O.S. we can hear the throng of children nearing in the BG.
</DIRECTION>
<THRONG>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd they go? I saw them go down that hallway. C'mon, let's get em'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THRONG>
<DIRECTION>
Hammer turns to Esther defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over. We're doomed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the Biblical slave song, "Let My People Go" sounds as if it's coming from within the walls of the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh. Shh, listen. Do you hear that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer tries to place the source.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a door. The other side of the door is dark, but it has a cavernous feel to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elderly Jewish woman, HARRIET TUBBELMAN, appears from out of the doorway. She smokes a corncob pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET_TUBBELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Psst. Hammer, Esther. This way. Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET_TUBBELMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet escorts the two into the passageway, and the door slides shut behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an 'It's A Small World After All' type water ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harriet leads Esther and the Hammer into one of the waiting cars. The cars kind of have a baby Moses straw basket theme going on. The 'Let My People Go' song, piped from unseen speakers, is now at full strength.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved our lives. Thank you. How can I ever repay you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<HARRIET_TUBBELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...My name is Harriet Tubbelman, but you can call me Moses. The only payment I ask Mordechai, is that you keep Hanukkah safe for us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET_TUBBELMAN>

She hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap restraints for Hammer and Esther, testing them to make sure they're secure.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should be safe from here on out. Just follow the river to it's conclusion.

	Oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs inside the water craft at all times.

	Where are we? What is this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles with great pride.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRIET_TUBBELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the Underground Jewish Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRIET_TUBBELMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it way from the loading dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet oddly entertaining way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check out the attraction in wonderment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Esther secretly glances at him affectionately. It's clear she's falling for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down the river. A funkdafied version of the "Let My People Go" song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear the muffled sounds of the gospel version of "Let My People Go." Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, "HANUKKAH NOW!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door, and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That got annoying fairly quickly.

EXT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Your typical Blaxploitation bar. It could easily pass for the Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large menorah shaped sign out front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS. A WALL separating the men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room, stopping about ten feet from the stage. Signs clearly demarcate these 'MEN' and 'WOMEN' sections.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Onstage, a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be determined 70's funk classic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Esther and the Hammer enter the joint. Mid song, the BANDLEADER notices the two walk in...
</DIRECTION>
<BANDLEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDLEADER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment. The entire bar cheers and applauds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hammer escorts Esther to a table on the woman's side of the wall, and then walks around to the other side of the divider where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band begins a rousing version of "Hava Nagila." A good majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and begin dancing zealously with one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din of the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, do you come here often!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer struggles to hear. He shouts back to her.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, do you come here often!?

A HASIDIC BAR PATRON approaches the Hammer and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HASIDIC_BAR_PATRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HASIDIC_BAR_PATRON>
<DIRECTION>
We get another shot of the men dancing together, arm in arm, on the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay right now. Thanks though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
As the Patron leaves, JOSHUA, another Hasidic man standing directly behind him takes his place at the Hammer's table.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSHUA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSHUA>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, I'm good. I'm kind of here with somebody.

The Hammer motions to the wall. Joshua looks as if his feelings are hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSHUA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Okay. Maybe next time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSHUA>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Maybe next time Joshua. Take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
As Joshua leaves, we get a WIDER shot of the Hammer's table. A LONG LINE OF MEN leads up to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAIM FEYGELE, an effeminate slick Hasidic man, chest hair spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt, neck dripping with gold chains, steps up to the Hammer. He's got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAIM_FEYGELE>

INT. THE HAMMER'S PAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the speakers. We do a SLOW PAN from the stereo into a TIGHT SHOT of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing. Sexy. Esther grunts and moans a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two, eventually pulling back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about. The Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes, forcing her into awkward positions, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes yet again.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch!

Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer.

She begins to unzip his pants. We cut to a shot of an excited Mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants reach its conclusion.

It's the kind of place where a giant telescope at an observatory would be housed. The clock is breathtaking in its size. On its face, in place of the standard numerals are the names of Jewish holidays. For example, "Yom Kipur" is where the twelve should be, followed by "Passover", etc. In the center of the face, an odometer-like gauge reveals the year '5734.' At its base, the brilliant blue Judeum glows brightly.

Esther walks in through the front door and spots something O.S. that gives her cause for concern.

BINOCULAR POV - Instead of your standard two circles filling the screen, we see the world through a pair of Star Of Davids. The place resembles the exterior of an industrial warehouse, with two Elves on guard with guns.

The Hammer wears Tefilon, consisting of leather straps with boxes, wrapped around his head and arms. He silently bows his head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to himself. Mo nervously scans the area for guards.

The Hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them high over the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boxes on the straps catch on a pipe. The line is pulled taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly around his waist. The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and turns to him.

No guards in sight. In front of them is door clearly marked "BACK DOOR."

	Well, that was easy.

Mo heads for the door. The Hammer calls to him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MOHAMMED>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.

Suddenly, the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the hall. They duck into a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the footsteps passes. The Hammer makes the silent military "eyes" gesture to Mo by pointing two fingers at his eyes, indicating for him to check and see if the coast is clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mo bends out from the corner to look. Pennies fall from his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<MOHAMMED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all clear. Let's go.

Mo and The Hammer start running down the hallway. Doors line the corridor.

The Hammer exits the room.

<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mo runs down the hallway after Tiny Tim. The Hammer turns towards the other direction to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO ELVES on multi-colored MOPEDS comin' right for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer stands motionless as the Elves gain ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right before they reach him, the Hammer quickly pulls his Talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched, clotheslining the two off of their mopeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elves are out cold. The Hammer admires his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santa, running for his life, rounds the corner. He stops dead in his tracks as he spots the Hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two look at one another for a brief moment, and then Santa points at something behind the Hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's that over there? Is that a bowl of Matzah Ball soup?

He takes off down the hall after Santa.

Mo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim, and begins to mock the manner and speed at which he runs, running side by side with him, circling around him as he attempts to get away, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing that it'd be impossible to outrun him, Tiny Tim comes to a stop.

Mo trains his pistol on him.

	Now I'm gonna do to you what I should have done earlier.

<DIRECTION>
Tiny Tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst.

Mo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs off. Tiny Tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down against the wall. We PULL AWAY from Tiny Tim as he calls to Mo.

</ESTHER>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And latkes! And some miracle oil that lasted eight days. And that my friend, should've been enough for you. Take him away Mo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Mo drags Santa out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SANTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I see the light now. I was wrong. I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANTA>
<DIRECTION>
And Santa's gone.
</DIRECTION>

The Hammer turns to Esther, and gets down on one knee. He places a ring on her finger.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you marry me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
She glows.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Of course! I'd gladly give up my last name to be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<DIRECTION>
The two kiss in celebration.

Joe pokes his head out into the Hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_LIEBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened out there?

	Oh Mordechai, you know how I detest gore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_LIEBERMAN>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>

With a bit of difficulty, Mrs. Carver works her large behind into her chair.

<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a Merry Christmas to all of our Gentile friends. Mun Chi.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CARVER>

</MRS_CARVER>
<HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(Proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I did save Hanukkah mom. My children, and my children's children, and my children's children's children...

<HAMMER>

</HAMMER>
<MRS_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(Interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Mordechai looks to Esther. She shrugs her shoulders in encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if you had saved Passover or Yom Kipur, then maybe you'd have what to brag about. Did I tell you that my friend Maureen's son, the Investment Banker, was responsible for a very big merger on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No, no, no, no, no. I see what you're doing here. So all of a sudden Hanukkah's not good enough for you, is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
We get a shot of Mrs. Carver. She's a master of the art of pleasant non-listening.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...

</HAMMER>
<MRS_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mazel Tov!

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm not finished yet, mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
Mun Chi, completely uninvolved in the conversation and obviously famished, scoops serving after serving onto his plate. Mrs. Carver ignores her son as she continues to play with the cat.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...A boojee boojee boojee boo. What's that Mazel Tov? Your tuchus needs some more airing out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Carver removes the diaper. Esther and Hammer gag from the smell of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mun Chi, a forkful of food inches from his mouth, gets a whiff and then places the utensil down in angry frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom! We're eating!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<MRS_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
This gets the Hammer going.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I get it. To you, the cat pooping in his diaper is somehow better than my saving a Jewish holiday.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Giving up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<MRS_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what are you two planning after the wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<MRS_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
From outside, we hear the sound of sleighbells ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I hear the new Santa Claus busy at work. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer motions for everyone to get up and follow him to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to the outside of the window looking in on the four as they try and get a better look outside.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot to ask you, who'd they put in charge as the new Santa Claus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CARVER>
<HAMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since Santa will be living out the rest of his days at a home for the religionally insane and because he had no blood heirs, the Kwanzaa Liberation Front and the Jewish Defense League agreed to make the whole Santa Claus process a democratic vote. We're all very pleased with the first Santa elect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The Hammer spots something up in the sky, and points it out to the rest of them.

	Look, there he is now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
The full moon shines brightly in the BG of the night sky as we slowly PAN past Rudolph and the rest of the reindeer, eventually reaching the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jamal holds the reigns and waves down at Mordechai and company.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the window, Mordechai, Esther, Mrs. Carver, and Mun Chi wave back. The Hammer Jewxploitation theme music begins to fade up.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas Jamal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMMER>
<JAMAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Christmas Niggas!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAL>
<DIRECTION>
We pull away from the outside window as the four continue to wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, the reindeer whip straight past camera followed by Jamal. As he clears frame we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO END CREDITS.
