EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Specifically, a garbage scow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty Mississippi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, except for an incongruously heroic score.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film rather than a feature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is obviously library. And not a new library either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLD HOUND DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front porch. The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. It is quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze fan them in and out of audibility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now and played as real, not slapdash effect. At this, the dog lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We DRIFT UP to show that the dog is sleeping before the

SAUCIER WORM STORE

We TRAVEL OVER TO REVEAL that the modest one-story structure houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the

SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a thumbs-up:

<DIRECTION>
INT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are DRIFTING toward the door of the lock-up, which stands open. The small cell is empty, its bed neatly made.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are ARCING slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that hangs from a nail. The OFFSCREEN snoring and whirring continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE SCANNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We DRIFT across the face of the radio. The peaceful steady hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snoring is also louder here. As we TRAVEL OFF the radio we are COMING ONTO a pair of feet propped up on the desktop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring of a telephone -- muffled, not present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_WYNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff Wyner...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_WYNER>

The muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, at the phone. Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled voice next door:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:

EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a neatly tended garden. It is the last house on a street of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond it the street disappears down a bluff. The empty space beyond suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise. The paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of the river.
</DIRECTION>

Mrs. Munson is entering by the gate. She stops in the garden and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect row of flowers.

</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
The cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover comes off the can.

<DIRECTION>
The can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish.

INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious-looking black man of late middle-age with a neatly groomed mustache starting to gray. A couple of candles sit on the mantel below the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine.

Mrs. Munson enters and lights the candles.

She shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting. As she sits she gives an audible groan.

A gust of wind hums under the eaves; the candles below the portrait flicker. As Mrs. Munson looks around the room, vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the cat arches its back and hisses.

At this moment the doorbell rings.

He is a middle-aged Southern gentleman wearing a panama hat and a cape over a cream-colored suit. He has dark circles under his eyes. The smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly, is wiped away by:

Dorr casts his hat aside and starts awkwardly climbing the tree. He gasps as he climbs:

	No need to call the authorities. I did this often as a youth -- why, I was a positive lemur... Here, kitty...

Dorr once again wiggles quotes with his fingers:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The word "band" would be, in this context, something of an anachronism. Though we do play together -- hence the word "ensemble" -- the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band" with its connotations of jangling rhythm and ear-popping amplification.

	So you don't play hippity-hop, "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo," songs with the titles spelt all funny?

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, I shudder. I quake. The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God. Devotional music. Church music.

TRACKING ON A GARBAGE CART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the cart is a boombox. It is playing "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is being pushed through a casino empty of customers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it:

<DIRECTION>
As they roll on we see more of the gambling floor, which is on something less than the scale of a Las Vegas casino. The floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at the tables, pit bosses with clipboards looking over their shoulders. Other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters, preparing to work.

	You gotta do it. Mr. Gudge checks everything. Man is a motherfuck. Shit -- looka this.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SMOKING FIELD SET - DAY

<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a ruin of a field; charred trees point bare and gnarled limbs toward a gray sky; smoke drifts across the desolate waste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is bounding towards us from the deep background. We BOOM DOWN as it approaches: a bulldog, running avidly toward us on its stumpy little legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OFFSCREEN male voice (CLARK PANCAKE):
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, Mountain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
There is an explosion that showers dirt in front of the dog and makes it veer. Something strapped around the dog's neck bounces as he runs.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Scrub two! Scrub three! Four, Mountain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Another explosion makes the dog veer back so that it once again bears on us. The thing that has been bouncing around its neck flies off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our CONTINUING BOOM DOWN has brought us to ground level just as the dog arrives in front of us to feed at a dog food bowl in the foreground. The yellow plastic bowl has a K-Ration logo facing us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear another OFFSCREEN voice (DIRECTOR):
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut, goddamnit. His canteen fell off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Director's feet enter in the foreground. He hooks the dogs belly with one foot and hoists it roughly away from the bowl. We
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT UP TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DIRECTOR. He scowls down at the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Props!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A man in a Hemingway field-jacket with multiple pockets, and also a loaded utility belt, trots up toward him, his belt jangling as he runs. This is CLARK PANCAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake is a florid beer-bellied man in his late fifties. He has a full blond-grey Grizzly Adams beard and wears multi- pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his Hemingway jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The director is angry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The goddamn thing's canteen fell off. It would have been a good take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake is unperturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. We're prepared for that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his headset:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mountain, bring Otto with the apparatus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING ANOTHER BULLDOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strains at his lead, muscling forward as quickly as his minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather gas mask, its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own snout. His phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TILT UP the lead to show his minder, MOUNTAIN GIRL. She is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning to merge into age spots. Her long straw-colored hair is tightly braided into Heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon. Otherwise her dress is unadorned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The director squints at the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake's manner is professorial:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	World War I vintage gas mask. It's authentic. Strapped on, of course, so it can't fall off. The animal is free to be as active as he wants, doesn't inhibit his movement, and I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like a fucking joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Nnnnrnff!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
The director squints at him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, nothing, uh... you're absolutely right, the gas mask is a whimsical concept--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Kennel Rations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes. Its breathing is growing louder.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're absolutely right–-
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let the client see this.

The dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel, breathing ever more loudly.

	They'll shut the fucking spot down, Pancake. Put the goddamn canteen back on. That says he's a soldier. Dented tin canteen. Just tie the damn thing to his collar.

His hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas mask off.

A crowd is starting to gather and gape. The director barks at a grip:

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear the super-present breathing of the helmet's occupant. Just over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a snap count.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in a crouch position looking downfield. At the call of "Hike!" we and everyone on the field spring into action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder. A very big person downfield is sprinting toward us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After several yards, still on the move, we PAN quickly around to look back for the quarterback. Barely visible among converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Easing up on the run we PAN BACK around to look downfield just as the oncoming defender is upon us and -- CRUNCH -- slams into us. A STROBING PAN leaves us looking up at the sky. Our loud breathing has stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored inhale. It continues irregularly. Another helmeted player appears above us to peer down into our helmet. He extends a hand to help us up.
</DIRECTION>

LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lined up opposite us is a snarling defender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again, over loud breathing, we can just hear the shouted count.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At "Hike!" we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging at us. His mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific CLOSE-UP he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort audible over our own ragged breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a primal roar from the defenseman our POV tips back and up, BOOMING DOWN to stop with a CRUNCH against the ground, staring up. Once again our breathing has stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming running back steps on us in his charge downfield. He is pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of whom by the sound of it step on various body parts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUDDLE

	Unh... oh no...

</HUDSON>
<DIRECTION>
Our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we continue to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We look back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every player is looking directly at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge spiralling football coming at us -- too close, too soon -- and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BONK!

<DIRECTION>
It bounces off our mouth guard and flies up.

<HUDSON>

</HUDSON>

We are looking forward just as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRUNCH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are hit by the defender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We once again land face-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very steeply FORESHORTENED, right over us, we see the defender juggling the live ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball and the high, distant defender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and starts back upfield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We climb wearily to our feet. We look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone. He pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand directly at us, then resumes his strut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shouting from the sidelines brings our PANNING attention over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and using his clipboard to wave us off the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We trot toward the sidelines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of our teammates stare at us –- some in shock, some in anger, some in pity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the sideline bench our POV swings round as we seat ourself. A hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet and we

It is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a Seven- Eleven, a launderette, and a Hi-Ho Donut. The Hi-Ho Donut sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much smaller lettering: And Croissants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music. After a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed. Both front doors open. Two BLACK KIDS get out and look around with a manner that is if anything too casual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum. Glass cases display donuts identified as GLAZED, JELLY, and FANCIES. Fancies ooze yellow goo. The jelly on the jelly donuts is developing a crust of age. The glazed also look moth-eaten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. Next to the coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes.

</VIETNAMESE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The two youths look at her briefly. Nothing else is forthcoming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drunk looks up from his paper bag.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't complicated. You give us all the fuckin money, you don't get shot in the head, you make more donuts, get more money. That's how it works, see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_2>
<DIRECTION>
The General stares at him. As with his wife, none of it seems to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us the money!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_1>
<DIRECTION>
He is pointing the gun directly at the General's head.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You got three fuckin' seconds. You understand one-two-three? I'm gonna count one-two-three and then shoot. Okay? Three sec–- huh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_1>
<DIRECTION>
The General has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside the youth's nostrils. His gun clatters to the floor. The fingers are way, way up his nose. Only one knuckle shows on each finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youth is staring cross-eyed at his own nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His friend is also stupefied.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH_1>
<DIRECTION>
(very nasal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His fingers are way the fuck up my nose.

<YOUTH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET... YA FINGAS... OUT... THE MAN'S... NOSE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_2>
<DIRECTION>
The General still impassively sucks on his cigarette. The first youth is on the verge of tears:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think they're in my brain, man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_1>
<YOUTH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MOTHERFUCK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH_2>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his gun to start firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does so the General uses his hook-hold on the other youth's nose to slam his head backwards, down into some Fancies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a customer walks in, a semi-elderly lady with a cane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, then back to the General who has his friend's head pressed into the Fancies, then uncertainly over to the Vietnamese woman who is loudly yelling at him in Vietnamese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cigarette still dangling from his lower lip, the General calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and tosses it into Youth #2's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Youth #2 screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is still pulsing hip-hop music. Youth #2 stumbles out of the Hi-Ho, hands covering his face and sinks to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General now has the first youth's face pressed into the Fancies from behind. Without disturbing his smoking, the General repeatedly kicks the youth in the ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His wife, muttering irritably in Vietnamese, is wheeling a water bucket and mop to where the floor is covered with coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the CUT many voices are swelling in a song of worship. It is a black Baptist church, and the music has great energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain, carrying the word a God, come down that Sinai peak, he caught those Israelites red- handed. What he catch 'em doin'? He caught 'em worshipping a golden calf.

Shouts of "That's right!"

<PREACHER>

<DIRECTION>
We are TRACKING among the congregants, disproportionately women, mostly of middle age and elderly, mostly wearing elaborate go-to-church hats.
</DIRECTION>
<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...It's what's in our hearts, each and every one of us when we like them Israelites! Slidin' awa-a-a-ay down that Godly slope, slippin' and slidin' toward the mire and muck a the stinkhole of greed -- that's DECLINE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREACHER>
<DIRECTION>
"That's decline!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CONTINUING TRACK brings us onto Mrs. Munson, wearing, like most of her peers, an oversized hat; hers is adorned with a great deal of plastic fruit.
</DIRECTION>
<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And what did Moses do when he saw those declinin' backslidin' never- mindin' sinners?

Mrs. Munson is at the kitchen table. She folds a five dollar bill into a sheet of paper, raising her voice as she does so:

INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

We have CUT to the portrait of Othar over the mantel. He does not answer.

From the kitchen:

Mrs. Munson has stuffed the paper-enclosed bill into an envelope, which she is now laboriously addressing to Bob Jones University.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the choir was all in good voice. Mm-mm-

There is a knock at the door.

<MRS_MUNSON>

The cat yowls and hisses.

I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mrs. Munson swings open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G.H. Dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry-washing his hands and obsequiously ducking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear Mrs. Munson, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice--

</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your-- Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at the long black vintage Lincoln hearse parked at the curb behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire. No, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble. And of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and gestures at the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At his sign, Gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clark Pancake emerges from the front passenger side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, emerges from a back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to let out Lump Hudson, the football player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument cases, each man taking one except for Lump himself, who carries two. As the parade of losers and misfits winds its way up the walk:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Let me introduce you to my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians... This is Gawain MacSam, our bassoonist...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain nods as he passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...General Nguyen Pham Doc, viola da gamba...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No smoking in this house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
The General tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Clark Pancake -- a multi- instrumentalist, but with his remarkable embosser Clark specializes in wind instruments, and is especially accomplished on the French horn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And, finally, Aloysius "Lump" Hudson. Lump is our sackbuttist and -- thank you, Lump -- I see you've also brought my fiddle...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
As he hands Dorr the violin case:
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your fiddle, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson sizes up the group.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't gonna make a racket, are ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. Oh no no no no no. No, we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be -- I think here the expression is uniquely appropriate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He gives a sickly smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...as quiet as the crypt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmph.

</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General stands stock still, his nose an inch away from the earthen wall, studying it, squinting through the smoke of the cigarette pinched between his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out the instruments. Gawain's case contains, however, not a musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes. He loads one of the tapes into the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think, General? Present any problems?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat the General turns away from the wall to give Dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Good then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He spreads a map open on the sackbutt case.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...All right, gentlemen, why don't we all crowd around and go over the plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north-south pair of lines: a river. A boat icon sits at one edge and from it a dotted rectangle extends inland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the Mississippi delta -- and the focus of our little exercise. Here is Orchard Street...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle extending from the boat. The street is lined by small house icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those icons.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom y'all met moments ago. Gentlemen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Bow taps emphasize:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You... are... here. Now. This brings us to this square...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The bow indicates it, and then withdraws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins to pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Gentlemen, I believe you are all aware that the Solons of the State of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land. They may, however, legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary. But while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats, no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis. The casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and most importantly its counting houses- the reinforced, secret, and super secure repositories of the lucre -- may all be situated... wherever. Gawain -- where is wherever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say wha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr's smug smile fades. Testily:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. End of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box; once a day all the cash boxes're moved to the counting room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where is the counting room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, uh... in that square there. Where you pointing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to him some trick.
</DIRECTION>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Offices. Underground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr's eyes close. A smile of feline contentment curls his lips. He murmurs:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Underground... Mmm... During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...This earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Any questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yes, Lump?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, uh... what does "cosseted" mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
Once again Dorr's smile fades. He does not dignify the question with answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The General here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The General acknowledges with a curt nod.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Clark Pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim. He will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Clark acknowledges verbally:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy to be on board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gawain is the proverbial "inside man". He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya damn skippy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this brings us to Lump. To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Professor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich. Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen. Let us make beautiful music together. And above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves. What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no "I" in "team".
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
All stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Lump has a very excellent point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The music swells, supported now by a male chorus that has the spirited manliness of the Red Army choir. We

DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men at work, tunneling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the hole now opened in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, wields a pickaxe at the forward point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the mouth of the hole Clark Pancake shovels dirt into a heavy plastic refuse bag held open by Gawain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G.H. Dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses perched midway down his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly pressed leisure suit and ascot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, Dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs, looking around the empty parlor. He gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the mantelpiece, the eternal flame of the devotional candle almost animating his features, Othar seems to watch the men as they cross to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men load the earth into the hearse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are at the Mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and dimming its lights. The men emerge; when they open the back of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to watch from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the men from HIGH, ANGLED DOWN along the masonry of a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge. An ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garbage scow is approaching. We hear the low toot of its horn as it nears the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, leaning over the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nose of the barge enters below us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump releases the sack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It thuds distantly onto the barge. The next sack has been passed up to Lump and is released.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat watches. Its orange eyes blink. Its pupils adjust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PULL BACK shows that the cat is in fact back in the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its POV: continued tunneling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whistle from the General and Lump and Clark Pancake scramble from the tunnel. They whip a curtain over its opening and all men grab up their instruments as Dorr, covering with a cough, turns off the CD player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General, his ever-present cigarette smoldering between his lips, tongue-and-lips it up and backwards so that it is inside his mouth, which he now closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marva Munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs. As the men come into view they are looking up at her, Lump holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and smeared with dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay, don't stop on account of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Lump looks around, saucer-eyed, then blows gamely into his sackbutt. It sounds like goose farts until Dorr waves him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no, madam, we were about to take a break anyway. The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and I think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh. I just thought you might like to see-what a you gotten up to, honey? Why you sweatin' like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
It is directed at Lump, who looks down at his own sweat- stained undershirt.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh...

</LUMP>
<GAWAIN>

	That man plays one bitch barrelful a sackbutt. Ain't no one can blow the tenor sackbutt like Lump, hoowee! goes at that thing like it was a pu-- uh, like it was a woman! Goddamn! He--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
She cuffs him on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind! I don't want that kind of talk in my home, even in the root cellar. This is a Christian house, boy, none of that hippity-hop language.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sadly, Gawain is given to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP! She slaps Gawain again.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes it's the only way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
He untenses after what seemed like the final blow, but -- WHAP! -- she slaps him again.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm tryin' to help you, son!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP!
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Better yaself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As well you should, ma'am. But Gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance as to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make no never-mind he's transported!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand your--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls her elbow away and sniffs.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You been smokin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not, madam. I understand your indignation. And I was offering explanation, not excuse. I myself am offended by those who cannot find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain calls up the stairs:
</DIRECTION>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you be explainin' me, dawg! You can't look into my mind, cape man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr's tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...A fiery lad! But then Youth is fiery! A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My youth I was in church, I wasn't walkin' around fiery. Youth ain't no excuse for nothin'! Well, anyway... only came down to show you the fife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a thick, roughly whittled piece of cane. Dorr holds it, looks at it dumbly. He is, for the first time that we have seen anyway, non-plussed.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Othar's fife. He burned his own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their backs to the fireplace:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Did he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hm. I thought maybe bein' a musical man you'd be interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I am indeed--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it himself and burned the holes. Israelites called it a kalil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kalil, fife, same thing. You can read about it in the Bible. Ain't nothin' new under the sun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed not.

From Othar's POV, slightly high, we see them both twist in their chairs to look up at the portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE of the portrait, LOW ANGLE. Othar looks down at us with what appears to be bemusement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marva Munson and Dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless beat. At length, Marva Munson sighs:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Blowed the kalil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, turned his lip -- to the shofar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Prompted by her silence, he adds:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded by the priests of the Hebrews?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know nothin' 'bout that. Othar didn't study no shofar, to the extent a my knowledge. The kalil was good enough for my Othar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She gazes at the portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Some kind of man.

INT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of coffee. Dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string tie. His manner is more mournful even than usual:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my. Oh my my my my my. This is a severe setback. I am distraught. I am more than distraught, I am devastated. Oh my, this is quite the monkey-wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade.

<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it fucks things up.

	Oh madam, we must have waffles. We must all have waffles forthwith!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
They hand in their menus.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Oh we must think. We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us to the very best of his ability! Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers, or perhaps a fruit basket, with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment.

	Shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'! He fired me 'cause I'm black!

Over the shoulder of the quietly weeping Mountain Girl:

	Yes yes, I must confess, madam, that often I feel more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of our modern world. To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called "dead tongues" has more currency than this mornin's newspaper.

Mrs. Munson is about to go out the door but notices something:

The heavy orthopedic shoes approach, and then, with loud Mr. Mogul sounds of effort, Mrs. Munson's hands and knees hit the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head drops in to view to peer in, her own cheek against the floorboards.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What the... Why, Professor!

We see the Sheriff watching and his HIGH POV of Mrs. Munson's enormous ass.

	...You know, there's the custodian, and then there's the man inside the custodian, y'understand what I'm sayin'...

Gudge opens the card. Inside is a hundred-dollar bill.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the whine of the drill faintly here, all but covered by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other men sit around. Dorr gives a casual glance at his watch as the whine subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>

	The drill bit's getting awfully hot. Gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill.

Pancake's eyes regain their focus:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Scranton, Pennsylvania. Came down here in 1964. Greyhound Bus. With the Freedom Riders. You know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't give a shit who they were. Just tell me when they gonna leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up North -- whites, Negros, and yes, Jewish people -- all working together, just like we are here. Concerned citizens who came down here so that local black people could have their civil liberties. So that people like you could have the vote.
	</DIALOGUE>

All look at Pancake. Quiet, except for the delicate chamber music.

There is a knock on the cellar door. The men freeze momentarily, then scramble for their instruments. The General flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth.

Dorr turns off the boom box, then calls:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, madam?

The door opens and Mrs. Munson comes down the stairs, holding a large plate covered by a checked napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend Mrs. Funthes is here so I'm about to go on out. I just wanted to leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person to person; each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured "Thank you, ma'am."
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Y'all sound pretty good. It'd be nice if you'd come by the church some day, give us a recital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr takes her by the arm and escorts her back to the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh madam, you are too kind. Our music, however, is -- how shall I put it? -- rather Roman in its outlook; many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see all right, but we don't make a big whoop-dee-do about denominations; everybody welcome at our church. We've had Methodists come in. Episcopals. Even had a Jew come in once with a guitar back in the sixties.

	Indeed. Excuse me, one moment, ma'am, and I shall see you off...

They have reached the top of the stairs and the Professor ushers her out but stays behind himself. He turns to address the rest of the men below:

Lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short.

The two women looking.

The front door of the house opens. Lump, the Professor, and Gawain emerge, escorting Pancake. Just before Gawain finishes closing the door the cat slips out.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PICKLES!

</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
The cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, up his favorite tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General follows and, also without breaking stride, clambers up the tree after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves. We hear the hiss of the cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are bundling Pancake into the hearse. Dorr calls to the women before climbing in:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The house is perfectly in order, but we need medical attention for Mr. Pancake who, during the disturbance, pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt.

The General leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues the animal down the road. We hear the retreating padding footsteps of all six feet.

CLOSE ON SCHEMATIC MAP

It shows the underground complex and, stretching towards it in a line drawn with a blunt pencil, is the tunnel. It is now almost to the vault.

A violin bow enters to tap at the line.

The men are clustered around the map, spread out on the sackbutt case in the cellar. Clark continues:

	...Just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault, and then we drill through.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?

</DORR>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I should think so, it's only one finger. Inhibits me in doing finer work, of course. I'll always have to live with that... Ahem. Maybe, and I'm just thinking out loud here, maybe since, as you say, it will present problems later...

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Clark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe -- and this is something I've talked over with Mountain Girl, and she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion -- maybe I should get a little extra compensation for the accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
A long, stony silence.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Somewhat larger share. Why, if this were any other line of work I'd be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't I? Might even have a pretty good lawsuit.

	Yes but you see, Clark, this is not what you just called "some other line of work."

</DORR>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if it were--

	This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailin' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor. Governmental regulations an' civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits.

Clark grumbles:

<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, okay, majority rules, like I say, it was just a trial balloon. Hand's not so bad really, I even get some phantom feeling.

Loud singing at the cut. We are looking at Mrs. Munson in the middle of the choir, holding forth in song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, arms folded across his chest. Faintly, from inside the vault, we hear the whine of a power tool. Gawain leans over and punches the button on boom box that hangs from the rolling garbage bin. The hallway pulses with "I Left My Wallet In El Segundo."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

More singing, Mrs. Munson and the rest of the choir now clapping as they sing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The power-tool whine is louder here. We are looking at a patch of wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, and with a loud rev as resistance gives way, a drill bit emerges from the wall, spitting out bits of the masonry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drill withdraws.

<DIRECTION>
After a beat, hammer blows.

The chunk of masonry begins to buckle.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clark and Lump, covered in dirt and plaster dust, have started stuffing bundled bills and small sacks into large garbage bags. An irregular hole, about three feet across, gapes in the far wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain punches off the boombox, looking at all the money.
</DIRECTION>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ain't that somethin'.

<PANCAKE>

	Hnnnn. Arrunggggh! Rnffff.

He stands stock still, wincing, gazing off into space.

He whispers hoarsely, urgently:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...IBS!

The other men look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GAWAIN>

	Oh man, you shouldn't be using the men's room--

We are CLOSE ON Gawain peering anxiously to one side.

He turns and peers the other way.

We hear a toilet flush and, after a beat, Clark emerges from the men's room door next to which Gawain stands. His manner is now completely relaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel thirty pounds lighter.

</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
They start walking back to the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Thank you for being so understanding. Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of IBS is educating the public. Afflicts over two million people yet most of us have never heard of it. And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race.

<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh fuck, man, I don't wanna know about it.

As the two men enter Clark is still holding forth:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I guess I never told you, that's how Mountain Girl and I met. They had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's, in the Catskills. Of course the tourist business up there has suffered, with the demise of the Borscht Belt. So they have different promotions, mixers, so on. This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories.

	Man, I don't wanna hear a single one a them stories.

<DIRECTION>
They stop short, looking:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General and Lump are standing in the middle of the floor, stock still, each clutching a bag of money, staring up at the same corner of the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump turns to Clark and Gawain.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, lookit that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain and Clark join them in the middle of the vault and look up at the corner of the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small video camera, aimed squarely at the four men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE CAMERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black-and-white video, very WIDE ANGLE HIGH SHOT, of the four motionless men below goggling up at the lens. Smoke plumes from the General's cigarette.

<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Hard wire...

</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, Gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam of wall and ceiling. At the opposite corner it travels down the joint of the two walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He traces its path down and then across one wall at chair- rail height towards the door. The other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just before reaching the vault door the wire goes through the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet. Gawain goes out the vault door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side, travels down to the joint of wall and floor, and then continues along the floor. Gawain follows it and the other men continue to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope. The other men scuttle behind into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - MONITOR ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wire winds around into the room, back up to chair-rail height, along one wall, behind some cabinetry which Gawain hurries past to find it again on the far side, and then down to a video recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is not, however, hooked up to the video recorder: its pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the video recorder is a casette, which Gawain ejects. The men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Shevann's Schvanz".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pile of other videos by the monitor: "Charlayne and the Chocolate Factory," "Big Dick Blaque's Big Night Out," "Lemme Tell Ya 'Bout Black Chicks," "Anus & Andy." Just next to the pile is an old bowl of Kocoa Krispies.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of money, followed by Lump, likewise encumbered. Lump hands back out a satchel to Gawain, who sets it on the vault floor by the hole. From the way he handles it, it is quite heavy. Pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb in:

I suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form, and we shall say, Well, with wit, and grit, and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble -- we, merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck, we happy few.

Dorr clears his throat.

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house. It was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished. Without a trace. Spirited away, as it were, by ghosts.

	The conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying. It is also exigent as a matter of practical fact: I remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house, this house's owner knows all of your names.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The colons in the display rhythmically blink, but the number does not advance. For some reason, stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches to his tool belt, pulls out his Leatherman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson is setting places at a large table. There are about a dozen place settings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake now has a mini-mag light clenched between his teeth, aimed down at the timer. He opens the phillips head on his Leatherman but abruptly stops and stares off into space.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nnnnrungh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He is squinting with pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muffled hip-hop song is beginning to recede.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAULT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart out the door. The vault is completely empty but looks completely undisturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the heavy vault door behind him, leaving quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet here as well, now. Pancake's moan trails off to nothing. He relaxes. The moment, whatever it was, has passed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back down at the unit, flicks it with his finger, and it emits a soft beep.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He squints at the back of the unit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it beeps again, he turns the unit over to look at its face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The readout now says: 00:10.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he watches, peering down through the bottom of his glasses, it continues to advance with a beep as each second slips by: 9... 8...
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What the--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes widen and he frantically shakes the unit. It continues beeping. He briefly and sloppily tries to fit the phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle back up the tunnel, whimpering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart past Elron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson is placing the last piece of silverware, just so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake is in full panicked awkward flight as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--BOOM! We CUT TO the cellar and Pancake is shot out the tunnel like a human cannonball, trailing a comet-tail of dirt, dust, and debris that wafts what were neatly stacked bills up into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The portrait of Othar jostles back to square. He now looks a little angry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat arches her back, emitting a startled yowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson stands, frozen, then looks slowly around, trying to assimilate what has just happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain and Elron are staring at each other, frozen, also reacting to what just happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally:

<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson is looking at the cellar door. Dust drifts out from under it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a slow step towards it. Another step. She opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes one step down the stairs, waving at the air in front of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paper money wafts in and out of the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Voices:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly all right. Not a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well there sure as shit ain't no tunnel left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
The clearing dust reveals the caped Professor anxiously dancing from foot to foot, gathering money out of the air. As he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in Mrs. Munson's direction, he freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV reveals her through dissipating dust.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor, I'm surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long beat, through which all stare at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Properly speaking, madam, we have been surprised; you are taken aback. Though I acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there is, settling now to cover the floor of the cellar.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You have returned from your devotions betimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the ring of the doorbell.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hadda fix tea. I wanna talk to you, Professor, don't you be leavin'. And don't make any more noise! And you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She points at the General who, in the excitement, has neglected to hide his ever-present cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I told you, I don't want any smokin' in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL HER towards the front door, angry and lost in thought. Her look softens somewhat as she opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a chattering infestation of hens: all of her friends from church push in wearing church dresses and elaborate hats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are still frozen looking up toward the door. The muted cackle of church ladies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men gradually unfreeze.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She saw everything. She saw our hole...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Dorr, near tears:
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...She saw our hole, Professor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr rubs his hands anxiously, thinking:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, first, my dear boy, we follow the General's example...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The General remains staring up at the door, frozen but for the smoke pluming from the cigarette in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and refrain from panic. Secondly, we cooly, calmly, collectedly think... think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The gaze of all the men drifts back up to the cellar door, and we look down at them, gazing up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chattering ladies are gathered at the table, Mrs. Munson pouring them tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say gothically -- ajar, and the Professor peers out with an ingratiating smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hsst... Madam...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The chattering abates and the ladies all look at him. His smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward Mrs. Munson.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Mrs. Munson, if I might have a word...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>

</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>

</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush! Down those stairs! We havin' tea now! I be down shortly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
He nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladies look inquisitively at Mrs. Munson as his footsteps are heard descending the stair.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He's the tenant.

</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She shall be down shortly...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Tea. Dainties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The men nod, murmuring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cellar door squeaks open. There is the clomp of careful footsteps on the stair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using only tongue and teeth, the General flips his smoking cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives Mrs. Munson his usual deadpan look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron and holding a spatula.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you boys been up to but I wasn't born yesterday and I know mischief when I see it. Now I want an explanation, but first I want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments. I been tellin' the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently returns.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Hmph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She turns again and clomps back up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General opens his mouth and, again without using his hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump is fretful:
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>

The cellar door opens and the men troop out, G.H. Dorr leading and the other men following rather sheepishly behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since, as you see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg.

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps I could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital. Though I don't pretend to great oratorical skills, I will happily present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Lump, Pancake, and the General sit and awkwardly accept dainty teacups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor rises, spreads his hand, and pronounces:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..."Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UPS of the various ladies, some sipping tea or slowly munching biscuits, but all eyes glued to the declaiming man in the cape.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"That gently, o'er a perfumed sea The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... "

</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Murmuring Voice:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen.

</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A slurp of tea from another quarter.

<DIRECTION>
Dorr bears on:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome... "

</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
A long silence.

<DIRECTION>
Then, scattered:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-mm. Glory hallelujah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
A lady holding a teacup turns to the General:
</DIRECTION>
<LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was soooome poem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY>
<DIRECTION>
The General stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You know any?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the front door opening and Gawain enters, still wearing his Lady Luck custodial uniform. He looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated among them, also holding teacups and scones.

INT. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - LATER (EVENING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; Mrs. Munson is seeing them off at the door. Evening is gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, wave off the departing ladies.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, ladies. We had such a pleasant time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I wanna know what's goin' on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing. Though in this instance, I believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others. Well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas -- I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The General stiffly bows:
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, continues to look at Mrs. Munson, though his story, apparently, has ended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She returns his ingratiating look with a stare.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What about all that money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr's smile fades.

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ah. The money. The money is... Mr. Pancake's.

</DORR>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in Mr. Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion.
	</DIALOGUE>

He agonizes. The words do not come easy.

	...What I am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, I must tell you that we are not... what we appear.

	Mm-hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance. Nor of the early or mid period. We are, in fact... criminals! Desperate men, madam! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure!

</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord have mercy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I offer no excuses -- save one! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal. As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. But you have wrested the information from me! Now it is all on the table. Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stolen money!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, I challenge you! Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm! It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! That is its function! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Just one penny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission! Why, I have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's prob'ly true...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor, warming, has resumed dry-washing his hands:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes. As long, that is, as the secret stays with us. And I, surely, shall not be the one to divulge it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson nods, musing.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... it's hard to see the harm in it... One penny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Her gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm her face. The smile freezes, though, as her look catches on something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her POV: Othar, above the mantle, looks down with a disapproving scowl.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No, it's just plain wrong. Stealin'. I know your intentions were good, and I won't call the police if you give the money back. But I gotta see that you do it.

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And... engage in divine worship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>

The group lapses into silence, considering. Even Gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor is solemn:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Not easy to do. Many reasons. Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, a sleepy town. Reasons of moral repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood. No, Gawain; would that it were simple!

	Well -- fuck, man! What we gonna do, give the money back and go to church?!

<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I suppose you are right. It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies -- the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife. But, think a moment -- look at the other tools we have at hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We have the cellar. We have masonry and trowel. Perhaps we could simply... immure her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, easiest thing in the world. I could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, anchor in some chains, Mountain has a source for the manacles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves. Think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick. Think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers... No, I fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act. No... no... shortest and most painless is best. Let us confront reality. Gawain's gun... the retort muffled by a pillow... into the brain... the affair of an instant. The only question is... who wields the weapon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around the table. Silence. No volunteers.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I believe it is traditional, in such circumstances, to draw straws.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sure, fair enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and snaps a handful of its bristles.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm thinking, though, that since I lost my finger -- I mean, literally lost it because of that goddamn cat -- maybe I should be excused from this thing. Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You one whiney motherfucker! I squeeze your nutsack you keep that up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, punk--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, no special pleading, no exceptions. It's in the nature of the situation that we would all prefer to be excused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles, takes one and snaps it in half, displaying the short straw to the group, and then hands the four long and one short to the Professor:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, okay... it was just a trial balloon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
With a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and encloses them in one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sweaty CLOSE-UPS. Each man stares at the straws. Some hesitant, some resolute, they draw:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First, the General: long straw. His reaction: impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, Lump: long straw. His reaction: relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, Pancake. Long straw.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long straw. You all see it. All your fuss over nothing, punk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Two straws left. Gawain stares at them, licks his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for one straw, touches it, hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Motherfucker...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
He touches the other straw, hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, closes his eyes, and pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to look: short straw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he holds the last long one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gawain moans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING HIM UP THE STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, slowly, Gawain mounts the cellar stairs. Behind him, gathered in a semi-circle and looking up from the foot of the stairs, the other men wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he plants one plodding foot in front of the other Gawain raises the gun, slides back its primer to make sure there is a round in the chamber, and then slides it shut as he reaches the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the foreground Mrs. Munson sits knitting, humming an old temperance tune. In the background the cellar door swings open. Marva Munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles continue their rhythmic clack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL Gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious steps across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We INTERCUT his POV of the back of the old lady's head, bowed over her knitting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries in it his hand holding the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back up at the old lady. But now, still cautiously approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
nearing the old lady is now different somehow. The perspective is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly different.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHEN WE CUT BACK TO GAWAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he is a runty, TEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD walking slowly across the floor; he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming little puppy dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog yips; the woman turns to look at us. It is not Mrs. Munson, but another black woman of about the same age.
</DIRECTION>

WHAP! WHAP! Gawain is sobbing:
</DIRECTION>
<CHILD_GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't hurt me, Mama!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILD_GAWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Now it is the adult Gawain blubbering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clack of knitting needles stops and Mrs. Munson turns to look.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you doin'? What you doin' with my pillow there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
He surreptitiously slides the gun into his pocket, sniveling:
</DIRECTION>
<GAWAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, ma'am, I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWAIN>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP! She cuffs him on the side of the head.

The men are stunned.

	Look, with equal rights come equal responsibilities--

</PANCAKE>
<DORR>

	I'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right, my dear fellow. We cannot draw straws again; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job.

He is waving the gun.

	You think you scare me, you mewling punk! You don't scare me! Bull Connor and all his dogs didn't scare me!

He lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both men tumbling to the floor, where they roll and wrestle.

Quiet.

The two men have stopped rolling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other where they lie, Pancake on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At length:
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Oh my god...
	</DIALOGUE>

Horrified, he slowly rises.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I think he's hit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANCAKE>
<DIRECTION>
The men gather round and look down.

<DIRECTION>
Gawain still stares up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pancake stoops, waves his hand in front of his eyes. No reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<PANCAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'll just check the carotid artery.

He checks the carotid artery.

INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CELLAR DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creaking open. The Professor, Lump, and the General peek out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr hisses:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is in the kitchen. I shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr enters breezily; Mrs. Munson is at the sink, filling a teapot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, Mrs. Munson has her back to the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have outlined your position to my colleagues and I now return to you to return our collective verdict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm-hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her, the General peers around the corner and starts a catlike advance across the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and- take. Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money; some were more receptive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care they was receptive or not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions. To a man, I must say, they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The General signals to Lump who now crosses the living room with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's carry.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that is a shame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. But at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money -- every last cent of it! -- and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility. Though that was the original preference of some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I'm glad y'all came to see the light, anyway. I'm gonna have some tea and go to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor, seeing that the General and Lump have made it out the door, is anxious to wind things up:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office. Enjoy your tea, madam...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Backing out, he looks to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling away from the curb. There is another car -- an old Volkswagon microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr looks back to Mrs. Munson.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor, confused sheep who had momentarily strayed.

<DIRECTION>
We are at the middle of the bridge, the tower gargoyle looking blankly down at the doings below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the misty night Lump and the General are braced over the railing, looking down, each holding one of the feet that protrude from the Hefty bag cinched around Gawain's ankles. A cigarette burns on the General's lower lip. Behind the two men we can see the idling hearse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the toot of the garbage scow. Lump and the General release Gawain's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their POV shows the sack receding and flumping into the garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below.

A flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts off the scow with angry caws.

Dorr is absent:

He mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand. We can hear the front door opening as the other men enter.

Dorr, bemused, but apparently moved by a hunch, advances slowly to the sackbutt case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up.

He lifts the lid.

<PANCAKE>

	No extra share, huh...

The smile abruptly fades.

He pants.

INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A FIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With three protruding straws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWEATING CLOSE-UPS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump picks a long straw: relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General picks a short straw. A short grunt.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent. I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job.

INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson lies on her back gently snoring. At the open window, sheers ripple in the evening breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large clock ticks upon the mantle. It is almost one o'clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CELLAR DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It creaks open. The General looks stealthily out. A cigarette in his mouth plumes smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the door fully open, emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson's snore catches on an inhale. She mutters something, sighs, and resumes snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General treads lightly, noiselessly, up the stairway leading to the second floor. He slides one hand into his jacket, pulls out a garotte.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop and snags the other handle with his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General emerges from the staircase and advances on the closed bedroom door. As he reaches for the knob he performs the no-handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings noiselessly open. The General pauses to survey:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The still room. The ticking clock. Mrs. Munson, a large sleeping mound upon the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General advances, raising the garotte in both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes on her sleeping form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock, striking one. It is a cuckoo clock but, instead of a bird emerging, a berobed Jesus comes out with his hand resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, his eyes widening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus retreats back into the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The General has swallowed his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches up to his throat, panicked. In a silent frenzy, he yanks loose his ascot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes wildly about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for the water glass at Mrs. Munson's bedside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tips it back into his mouth. There is a rattling sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers and lowers -- rattling toward his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GENERAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass back down. Wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mad but silent dash for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plunging for the head of the stairs--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a brief yowl from the cat--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on, a hiss and a flash of its claws at the General's leg--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing his body like a rag doll's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bottom of the stairs he lies still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE-UP shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, unblinking eyes staring. Traces of smoke wisp from each nostril and his open mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the mantle, Othar returns the dead man's stare. He looks somewhat smug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor and Lump, responding to the noise, look slowly up toward the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor stands looking at it, contemplatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump stands looking at it, contemplatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, impassively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The professor muses:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...T'was our até brought us to this pass...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Professor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
There is the toot! of an approaching scow. Dorr's manner is still absent, his regard still on the corpse:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our overweening pride... The old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He rouses himself, goes over to the bagged corpse. Lump follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now, Lump, I'm afraid it falls to you to finish the job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
They let the body fall onto the scow passing below.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The comedy must end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor turns to Lump and tries to hand him Gawain's gun, but Lump, uncomfortable, declines to take it.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Professor, I been doing some thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she's right! Maybe we should be going to church!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear, Lump. I feared that those would be your words. Not that I don't appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought. But please recall, young man, our respective functions in this enterprise. I am a professor, the professor as you yourself so often say, the thinker, the "brains of the operation," trained in fact in the arts of cogitation. You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the error of thinking! Now is the moment of praxis! Now, my dear boy, you must act!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
Lump reluctantly takes the gun that the Professor thrusts upon him.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it, Professor! A nice old lady like that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide! Recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And reflect also that if you decline to act, forcing me to do so, then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money! Your offices shall have been nugatory!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean -- you mean -- you're gonna kill her?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! My hand would be forced!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let you do that, Professor! A nice old lady like that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You?! Allow? Not allow? What presumption! You stupid boy! You very very extremely stupid boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the toot of an approaching scow -- this one very long, sustained under all of the following:
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
He points the gun at the Professor and--
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Well who looks stupid now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
--squeezes -- click -- on an empty chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the gun to have a look.
</DIRECTION>
<LUMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No bullets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUMP>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shows the foreshortened barrel as he experimentally squeezes the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Professor on the BANG! and, after a sad shake of his head,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scow-horn ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps... it had to be thus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the railing to look down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lump, face-up on a pile of garbage, glides away. Disturbed birds flap upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The professor muses:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
His gaze rises with the ascending birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the white gulls is one black bird. The Professor eyes it as it rises past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Hm. A raven?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
FROM VERY HIGH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we look down on the Professor, the black bird rising to perch on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE PROFESSOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the receding scow:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...The agate lamp within thy hand... "
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
BACK HIGH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless bird flaps off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE PROFESSOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
very dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time and space:
</DIRECTION>
<DORR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ah, Psyche! from the regions which Are Holy land!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORR>
<DIRECTION>
This is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring a direct hit on his head. He falls over the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless. Directly below his dangling body the stern of Lump's barge is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of chains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fabric of the Professor's cape begins to tear. His body drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the body rips free. It falls away from us. As it does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second- banger -- a garbage barge being chain-towed by the receding scow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorr's body lands neatly on the barge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gust of wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cape flaps free of the railing and is wind-tossed away amidst the cawing birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat, watching, blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRINKING GLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is resting on the very edge of the night table -- protruding, in fact, past the table's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is morning. We hear rustling from the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands reach INTO FRAME and hesitate, finding the glass empty of water and precariously perched.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
The hands tip the glass and take the teeth. We hear complicated oral noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens away to reveal the morning paper lying on the stoop. Mrs. Munson leans INTO FRAME to pick it up and we ADJUST as she straightens to have a look:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headline says: $2.6 MILLION DISAPPEARS FROM LADY LUCK CASINO. The subhead: POLICE BAFFLED.

</MRS_MUNSON>
<DIRECTION>
She stops midway down and looks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The empty cellar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Money stacked neatly on the card table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson sadly shakes her head.

The sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy, then murmurs into the phone:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_WYNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call you right back.

</SHERIFF_WYNER>

He cradles the phone and smiles at Mrs. Munson.

	How'd it get there, Marva?

</DEPUTY>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bunch a desperate men that stole it put it there, that's how! They was musicians of the Renaissance period, played the sackbutt and so on -- well, it turns out they really couldn't play, although they could recite poems to break your heart. Their ringleader speaks in dead tongues.

EXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Munson is walking home. It is a beautiful spring day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear the church chorus singing. Mrs. Munson joins in. She has a strong voice:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MUNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure from all harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting arm.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pickles scurries along the walkway. We hear the toot! of an approaching scow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat reaches the middle of the bridge. He sticks his head through the bars of the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When we CUT CLOSE on the cat as he looks down at the water, we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and lets the finger drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it hits the scow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat looks up INTO THE LENS, and blinks. Its sideways irises adjust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scow is gliding away. With the low mournful toot of its horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where scavenger birds pick through the trash.
</DIRECTION>

THE END
