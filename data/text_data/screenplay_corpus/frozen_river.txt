A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St. Lawrence River.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open, smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in the cold morning air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her bare feet rest on the cold ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR., leans out the trailer door.

:SC: INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture.
</DIRECTION>

Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into a pair or jeans and a t-shirt.

A PICK-UP TRUCK DRAPED WITH A "WIDE LOAD" banner leads TWO SEMIS hauling halves of a DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind.

Ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly, trying not to pee himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T.J. comes out of the shed.

<DIRECTION>
The Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard.

GUY VERSAILLES, pot-bellied, in a green velour running suit, squeezes out of his truck. On the door: "MASSENA MODULAR AND MOBILE HOMES, NEW AND RECONDITIONED."
