:SC: INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hall is full. On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is speaking. HELEN is a forensic psychologist. Behind her is a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA, FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser pointing device. We see her from a considerable distance... the back of the balcony. Her voice is crisp and assured.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is terrible. They are hard to catch. They are "the nice guy next door," their employers -- if they work at all -- find them quiet and uncomplaining. Early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity. Only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive. What they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity. For these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being. Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain. And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. Like addicts seeking their drug, Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they seek out their next victim.

During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the balcony railing.

CLOSEUP: HELEN

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cycle is endless until they are caught. And they are caught by chance -- they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk. A leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in the balcony... Her voice chokes off. She stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed arms on the railing. He smiles intimately at HELEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN cuts her eyes to the left. She sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes. Instantly alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of exposing his presence to the audience. A SECOND COP, in the wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to attention. FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their POV: THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN Can she believe her eyes? Resumes:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At any time, right now, as you listen, the FBI estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims. The serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science. Florida spent eight million dollars to execute Ted Bundy. It would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself that the smiling man is not there...
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confined for life, without parole, and subjected to scientific study, these men's lives might finally, in some small measure, educate and thereby protect society. Thank you.

Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS. They are carefully casing the crowd.

LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is breaking up. FIRST COP walks HELEN to the ladies' room. People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes as well as she can with her fear. THEY LEAVE THE STAGE THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

:SC: INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks around. Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS. He hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen. Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to stand guard outside. HELEN walks past the stall with the high heels to a stall several doors down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the ankles. The shoes are kicked off. The feet disappear from view as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper around the seat before raising her skirt. A faint noise makes her freeze. Her hand reaches for the door. She is just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently yanked tight. She kicks at the stall door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He reacts...

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a hook inside his own stall. KNOCKING (o.s.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Hudson? Are you okay in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN lets slip a little slack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck, get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous sounds from inside. Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door. Now there is more SOUND from inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COP steps into the room, gun down. Over the COP'S shoulder we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at her throat. She has one slippery shoeless foot on the toilet seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COP takes a couple of steps forward. Behind COP'S back we see a broom closet door opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind. In a second, his throat is slit. In a gush of blood, he falls, his gun still in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at HELEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING. The violent contractions in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS, the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck. She is now pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her eyes. This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

The room is neat -- nobody there. (We will later see that it is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone. SHE TALKS TO HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM, where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.) The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm herself with the sound of her own voice...

She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window curtains open. BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN! We see that the T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us." She crosses to the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County. The morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog. HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the air, the freedom. Feeling quite restored from the dream horror of the night...

<DIRECTION>
THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso; centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the shoulder, is a small red circle. Still SMOKING, THE HOLES FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none in the circle.

<RUBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBEN>
<DIRECTION>
We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J. HALLORAN. M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking young woman. She is neat, buttoned down, crisp. M.J. appears to be about twenty-five. She is, in fact, thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of sergeant. She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear even smaller and younger than she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior in authority to M.J. RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored and laid back. He has a cellular phone attached to his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM, AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

	I'd feel a whole lot safer with Sister Loretta for my backup. Look at this guy: you shredded him!

	Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me now.

</RUBEN>
<DIRECTION>
The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back to shooting position.
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sloppy shooting. It's in character, Ruben, but unnecessary. And bad for your career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the circle. M.J. looks at him in surprise.

	You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?

He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be. She is unloading her weapon...

	The problem is between your legs. You told your shrink about that?

Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the screen until, tense from sitting too long, with waiting for CHESSMASTER'S move, HELEN begins to stretch her neck and toll her head.

Two heads. One, properly on its own neck, the other emerging from between two legs. Hands, feet, breasts, hair of two bodies mixed mischievously into one FINAL IMAGE OF A SECOND WOMAN ALIVE AND SMILING ECSTATICALLY AT THE CAMERA. Both women wear their hair in long braids.

But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky. You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard. Or the worst: there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month. The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark. And then, one day, there are no more. What happened? Did he just stop? Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself? Did he die in an auto accident? Or a fight. Or get sick and die? It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth. And you never know. But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?

:SC: INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw up over her. He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it to her. She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer water, then watches her take the pills. After which he takes the bottle and pockets it.

RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa. As her eyes close, RUBEN comforts her. TV features the antics of a nervous little prairie dog family. He looks back at HELEN.

<DIRECTION>
We hear a faint but impatient voice call:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CROSS FADE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dim light. The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not comfortably. A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed. She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks older. A chronic invalid. By her side is a NASTY LITTLE DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur. Near the bed is a TV and video, on which a movie's final credits are running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER enters. Younger than the woman, rather good-looking. Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near his hairline. AN OLD SCAR. He goes straight to TV and puts the tape on 'eject.'
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put in the Kevin Costner.

</WOMAN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.

</PETER>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself. Where're you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.' Then he approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a lock of hair back from the forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him, staring at the screen. The NASTY LITTLE DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much!

(to Peter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you feed her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I fed her. If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you. Again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't lie! You sure you fed her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I don't know. Why would you lie? That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking to her dog over the TV soundtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would you? Just to get Dad in trouble? Such a naughty widdle dog...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen, then through a door leading to the basement. He locks the basement door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets and computers. As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a small TV/video set attached to a wall. On its screen, freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over something to turn the video back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across. It is the YOUNG GIRL from the concert. She is strapped onto a table, her mouth taped shut. A plastic bag covers her head, but not tightly. She is semiconscious. She is being asphyxiated by slow degrees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made toward his wife. He whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>

	Didn't I promise I'd come right back?

:SC: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of glorious misty green hills, hand in hand. The Camera moves down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway. A few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a number of unmarked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH THE SCENE TO FIND M.J. M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns away. Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up all night with a sick friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBEN>
<DIRECTION>
NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

	You dumb son of a bitch! You don't even know how to treat a woman.

</NIKKO>
<RUBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? M.J.? Hey, Nikko, explain to me why she gave you the boot...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBEN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE. The plastic bag is now tied tight around her neck. She has been posed beneath a sign that says "NO DUMPING". The usual technicians, photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBEN>

	Is Niccoletti assigned here?

	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails. I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about her arms?

Nikko appears, looming over her...
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably so stoned she never knew what got her. Like Goetz's sick friend. Right Goetz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKO>
<DIRECTION>
They ignore him. M.J. stands...
</DIRECTION>
<RUBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's blue as hell. No marks on her neck. Asphyxiated? not the same -- no ligature marks. Outdoors...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBEN>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at her legs.

	If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up?

	Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of them last night. Very easy pickin'. Goetz's type.

<DIRECTION>
Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes Ruben. Everybody stops in astonishment. M.J. steps between them. Ready to get physical herself; they settle...
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing? The Mouth and the Haircut are right down there, thank God they didn't see that.

Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival- of-Lovers.

<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Niccoletti, they're on the wrong side of the tape, you want to push them back? Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut. M.J. gestures for RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow her back to the cars. As they move more slowly down the hillside to their cars...
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.

<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
M.J. looks at Nikko. He should know better. She's also thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at this point -- or not?
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on the wrong side of the tape. We're still trying to find any footprints or tire marks and we don't want to chew up the ground, okay? I'll talk to you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nikko)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, too.

She's got Susan outside the tape...
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...

She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other side. Susan races for her silver Audi...
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruben, put the light on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES. SUSAN has a faster car, but M.J. is a better driver. Stomach dropping hills, trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the familiar San Francisco chase scenes.
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen up, Ruben. You never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me? Excuse me?! What do you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBEN>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You damn well better start working on that impulse control. A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of evidence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<RUBEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless? Who's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBEN>

	The woman's unstable. You could wind up with a harassment charge. Anything. You're like some horny little teenager.

M.J. takes another two-wheel corner. In the rear view mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody who's ever watched TV knows about that corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

	Everybody could see you -- unshaved, same clothes from yesterday, reeking of sex.

As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW) continue away from CAMERA down another corridor. Through the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between cops and FBI. The cops are at ease; bellies slop over belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat stains; shirtsleeves. The marching men wouldn't sweat.

	Meryhew Saks. The song is called "Murder By Numbers." The performers are a group called The Police. Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note. This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers. We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims. We have a team sweeping sperm banks. Now I want to say a few word to you local people. Your Commissioner asked for our assistance. The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year. We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy. Together we can be unbeatable. Which one is Inspector Halloran?

	...You're on the air, who's this...Ron, that's not my right name... that's okay, Ron. What are you afraid of?... I don't want anybody to know my name, because I'm a friend of Peter Foley? I know him from the gay community? He was cruising the night...

PETER AND THE COED are just moving off, the Coed holding his books, he hobbling on the crutches. M.J. runs through the crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from sight behind a wall, PETER looks around, straight at M.J..

THERE ARE STUDENTS AT SOME DISTANCE, BUT SHE CAN'T MAKE HERSELF BE HEARD. SHE IS GROGGY FROM THE BLOW SHE'S TAKEN. HE HANDCUFFS HER TO THE CAR, FIND HER KEYS, AND BEGINS TO DRIVE AWAY... PETER'S HAIR IS NOW BRIGHT RED -- LIKE DARYLL LEE CULLUM'S.

THE HALLWAY (HER POV). IT SEEMS MILES LONG. SOUND: HER FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR. BRIDGES BURNED. TURNS BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL. THEN HER HAND MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV. THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL. MOVING SHOT PICKS UP SPEED...
</DIRECTION>

HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.

The door opens and Helen appears in it. She confronts the street and the night... One more threshold to cross...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED. THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME. The night seems to roar; the lights blur and flare. A truck comes past too fast, stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

REVERSE: HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US. SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET FLAGGING HER DOWN --

SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW. SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE GAS. SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT. SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

<DIRECTION>
SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING HIM FROM SHOOTING.

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and brakes behind M.J.'s car.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge doors creak open and Helen enters. She stands, listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily returns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her. She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a building cooling in the night air. Or is the movement of Peter somewhere in the room?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the auditorium...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE. NOTHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER IS STARING BACK. HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE. THE VISION SNAPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK CORRIDOR. SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY. THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT. AS SHE WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP. SHE SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM. THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN. IN REVERSE, WE SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM HER NECK. WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP, BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING. (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT ALL.) SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE DOOR OPENS. THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT, BLINDING IN HERE. SHE STEPS IN. THERE IS A SOUND THAT DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR. IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

<DIRECTION>
M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE. SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

<DIRECTION>
HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT. PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER, REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cheated! You said you'd come die with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE HANGS. HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN, WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk to me about courage. I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear. You chocked. I know something else about you.

Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a pill into his mouth and swallows...

	You want one? No? There was something in you that was fascinated, that wanted to see what
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
it was like for a man to die.

HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE, INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER. GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do that? Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
	</DIALOGUE>

BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES BUT PETER DOES NOT.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do anything you want to me. I give myself to you. Only put the knife down. Isn't this what you always wanted? I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved. I could love you. You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor? That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick. So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you? Death is the only cure for people like me.

He leans toward her with the knife. This might be the moment. His gun lies on the floor beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS, TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS. HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD. SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT HER...

HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it. For God's sake, now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
M.J. FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE, SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised, like a child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hurt me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND SHADOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...
</DIRECTION>
<M_J_HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J_HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWAT TEAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus that hurts. You think the rib is busted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<PARAMEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That looks like just a bad bruise. I'll tape it up if you want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take some Tylenol and codeine, instead, how about a lot of number six?
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
The medic turns to his medicine bag. Cops swarm around them. Helen sits down next to M.J. M.J. begins to put on her shirt, wincing at the movement. Helen helps her.
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
<DIRECTION>
(it hurts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND LIGHT AND SHADOW. When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun and hands it to him. It is what he expects, but she misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her resignation from the cops. He takes it only as a part of officer related shooting routine. SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take it, kid. You take two weeks paid leave. Don't waste a second thinking about that shitbag. Then come back. You're a cop, M.J.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINN>
<DIRECTION>
He nods to Helen...
</DIRECTION>
<QUINN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the civilians outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINN>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINN>
<DIRECTION>
B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage and lifted him onto a gurney. The body is wheeled past them, as...
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only one who could tell you what you really need to know is dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's a thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINN>
<DIRECTION>
Of no importance to him, he turns away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion grenades). Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault. M.J. and HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE AUDITORIUM (POV).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a small door -- easy escape. They run toward it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dark where they step out into the night. Around the corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA CIRCUS. THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS. M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID. SHE CATCHES UP TO HER. HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK AWAY...
</DIRECTION>
<M_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could use a long hot bath, you know that? You better get somebody to drive you home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't I drive home? I will. You. Look at you. You need a ride home. And you don't even know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<M_J>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_J>
<DIRECTION>
The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside the circle of media. CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Halloran! What's the story here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
On the two women getting in the car...
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she has to ask, she's never gonna know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
