Over CREDITS we HEAR:

<MARIA>

(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	...but you took a huge bet on the housing crisis in the middle of the biggest boom anybody'd ever seen. Why?

</MARIA>
<ROBERT>

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - DAY

<DIRECTION>
As the conversation continues we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3. An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long winding staircase.

	They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen.

INT. ROBERT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

And right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER (60) -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a CAMERA CREW, mid-interview. ELLEN MILLER (58) watches on a nearby MONITOR.

<ROBERT>

	This was fifth-grade econ.

<DIRECTION>
(smiles, off her laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst.

FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH

<DIRECTION>
And we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine, as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FALCON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed tones, pouring over a sea of red-inked paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the galley, GAVIN BRIAR (42), pours a coffee. He brings it BACK TO ROBERT who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit, scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT DOCUMENTS. His effortless slouch, silver hair, and all- commanding mannerisms make one thing clear: Robert's our man.
</DIRECTION>
<GAVIN>

(handing him the coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go...

Robert sips it.

<GAVIN>

	It makes no sense.

<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there?

</ROBERT>
<GAVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To sign.

</GAVIN>
<ROBERT>

<GAVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac, followed by Gavin and the aides.

They approach a waiting MERCEDES MAYBACH. The aides hand file BOXES and BRIEFCASES to the Hispanic driver, RAMON, who loads them into the trunk.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRACIE SQUARE - ROBERT'S MANSION - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous turn-of-the-last-century Stanford-White-designed red-brick MANSION- two already-giant townhouses combined. Robert and Gavin exit the limo and head inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's our first glimpse of Robert's home, and it doesn't disappoint. It's an 1850's Tudor given a full once-over, maintaining period details but updated with a Modernist flair. It actually works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters, handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN laughing. Hold on Robert's face- some mixture of excitement and anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A party in progress, dinner already served.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and THREE GRANDCHILDREN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

<ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
(LIGHTING UP)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, your grandfather's here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the table, hugging them all.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, guys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<GRANDCHILD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDCHILD>
<DIRECTION>
Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast to his behavior towards their kids.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs. You're spoiling them rotten.

</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had to eat. The kids were starving...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<ROBERT>

(hugging her, happy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a toast.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday!

Everyone laughs a little.

<ROBERT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(MORE LAUGHTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for,

	That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business!

</ROBERT>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, here we go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
More group LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much.

INT. ENTRY HALL - LATER

Ellen is supervising the yawning children as the party winds down. She sees Robert put on his OVERCOAT.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A TAXI stops in front of a large frosted-glass apartment entrance. Robert exits, paying the DRIVER through the window.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIE CÔTE (32) sits at the head of a marble table in the exquisite space. It's the modern mirror of Robert's mansion, the lines carried through fully this time. And Julie is the modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack of INVITATIONS for the "Julie Côte Gallery - Paintings by Victor Rodriguez - April 10th" as she downs the last of a WHITE WINE. She's got a seating chart out that she's working on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The INTERCOM RINGS. Julie heads over, sees Robert's face on the VIDEO MONITOR. She holds a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOFT APARTMENT - SAME

Robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as Julie watches him from inside the loft, not moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a second, the door BUZZES open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIE'S LOFT - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert enters. Julie is already back at the table, writing. She's arranging 4 POLAROIDS of different paintings on a wall, along with a SEATING CHART. He walks down the long hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes up behind her, running his arms across her stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(standing in frustration)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine, lights a cigarette. Robert trails.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette, then stubs it out. He gestures to the dining table.

<ROBERT>

(slight beat, then DEFINITIVE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will be there.

She stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh wow, that's great.

</JULIE>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her hand and... SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate 18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive glass conference room. They arrive at

<DIRECTION>
INT. GREENBERG'S OFFICE - SAME

	What do you want me to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<JEFFREY>

EXT. JULIE CÔTE GALLERY - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert exits his MAYBACH in front of a big scene in progress: trendy FOLKS overflowing into the street, cameras FLASHING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The space is cavernous, modern luxe -- a Liagre design with thirty-foot columns and slab granite. The ART COLLECTION on display is indeed beautiful- photo-realist paintings -- and each one tells a strange story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert enters and scans the room. No Julie. He approaches the gallery ASSISTANT.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How're they doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Everyone loves them.

</ROBERT>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So-so.

</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>

	She's in the back.

</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLERY - OFFICE IN BACK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pick up on Julie bumping two rails of COCAINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's dressed in a burnt red, form-fitting Lanvin dress, hair coiffed, perfectly made-up-- if we didn't suspect anything, we'd think she was the precise image of New York art-world success.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie pulls her hair back and straightens, enters the main gallery...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where she quickly sees Robert searching for her through the crowd. She stops dead, considers going back into the office...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she stands firm. Robert finds her eyes. He stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares back, with a simple look that says, plainly: "Go away."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and heads off to talk to a group of PATRONS, including the painter VICTOR. One of the group is a DASHING YOUNG MAN- is he flirting with her?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert approaches, staring at the young man, then at Julie. She's all smiles, but she doesn't immediately introduce him. He stands there, until--
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>

	Hey, Julie.

	This is Robert Miller, one of our collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava, who is a talented young artist.
	</DIALOGUE>

Robert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries, especially kind to young AVA (15).
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>

	Oh, really? Painter?

</ROBERT>
<AVA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he notices Julie leave, to the group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT>
<DIRECTION>
Robert trails Julie, moving up to her quickly. He reaches out to touch her and she spins towards him violent, definitive.

Julie heads back to the buyers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out towards the entry desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie's a touch worn from the evening, but she's still composed. She sits with five guests including her gallery assistant, the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN from earlier, TWO WOMEN, and TWO GUYS who look like painters. One does a line of COCAINE off a "Fantom" magazine.

A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie rests her head on Robert's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

INT. CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement returns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at Julie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shock, followed quickly by panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at the phone just before pressing "Send"... and hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to touch her, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELDS - DEAD OF NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert walks and walks through tall grass.

<DIRECTION>
In the distance behind him, A MASSIVE EXPLOSION lights up the sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches, incinerating the car and its contents.

	But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY!

Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the PHOTOGRAPH he got from the toll authority. He lays it on the counter.
