INT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1823
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total darkness. We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress. It is OLD SALIERI. He uses a mixture of English and occasionally Italian.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me! Forgive your assassin! Mozart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
A faint light illuminates the screen. Flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs. We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing. Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET. By his side is Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. A cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Valet tries the handle. It is locked. Behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg you! Show mercy to a guilty man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
The Valet knocks gently on the door. The voice stops.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the door, Signore! Please! Be good now! We've brought you something special. Something you're going to love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come now. Be good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, and louder. We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen! I confess!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
The two servants look at each other in alarm. Then the Valet hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs. It is a windy night. Snow is falling and whirling about. People are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them. Some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties. Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house. The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any longer! I confess! I confess what I did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir I confess! I killed you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
The door of the house bursts open. The Valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake. The wind catches at his shawl.

<VALET>

(looking up to the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right, Signore! He heard you! He forgave you! He wants you to go inside now and shut the window!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
Old Salieri stares down at him. Some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Signore! Look what I have for you! I can't give it to you from down here, can I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
Old Salieri looks at him in contempt. Then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. Through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street. They stare back at him in confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<BYSTANDER>

<DIRECTION>
The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, the dish of cakes in the other. The Valet arrives, panting.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no. The Valet again knocks on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here I am, Signore. Now open the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm - this is good! This is the most delicious thing I ever ate, believe me! Signore, you don't know what you're missing! Mmmm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's enough, Signore! Open!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything. There'll be nothing left for you. And I'm not going to bring you anything more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down. From under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing. In horror, the two men stare at it. The dish of cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the candlestick down on the floor. Both servants run at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the frail lock gives. The door flies open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins. We see what the servants see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive. He gestures at them. They run to him. Barely, we glimpse the room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte- piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, full orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in progress. A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle- aged doctor in a tall hat. This is DOCTOR GULDEN. He gets in beside his patient. The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.

A wide, white-washed corridor. Doctor Gulden is walking down it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but somewhat self-important. This is Father VOGLER, Chaplain at the hospital. In the corridor as they walk, we note several patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally. All patients wear white linen smocks. Doctor Gulden wears a dark frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.

INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bare room - one of the best available in the General Hospital. It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century. As Vogler enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out the window. His back is to us. The priest closes the door quietly behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Herr Salieri?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGLER>

Old Salieri turns around to look at him. We see that his throat is bandaged expertly. He wears hospital garb, and over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later see the EMPEROR invest him.

Of course, I knew God had arranged it all; that was obvious. One moment I was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town. The next I was here, in Vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father. Do you know who he was? The greatest composer of his time. And he loved me! That was the wonder. He taught me everything he knew. And when I was ready, introduced me personally to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the musical king! Within a few years I was his court composer. Wasn't that incredible? Imperial Composer to His Majesty! Actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter? He adored my music, that was enough. Night after night I sat right next to the Emperor of Austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight-reading. Tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow? And believe me, I honoured it. I was a model of virtue. I kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life. And it was wonderful! Everybody liked me. I liked myself. I was the most successful musician in Vienna. And the happiest. Till he came. Mozart.

He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him. He ducks down behind the pastry table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room. She runs straight across it and hides herself behind one of the tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, stops, and looks around. He is age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat. Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. We hear a high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart throughout the film.

The throng is mostly seated. The musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments; the candles are all lit. A Majordomo appears and bangs his staff on the floor for attention. Immediately COLLOREDO, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg enters. He is a small self- important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap. He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count ARCO. Everyone stands. The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits. His guests sit also. Arco gives the signal to start the music. Nothing happens. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the Chamberlain and whispers in his ear. Arco in turn whispers to the Archbishop.

The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing. The leader yields his place to the composer and Mozart smoothly takes over conducting.

Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. The squeezebox opening of the movement begins. Salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon. He stares in disbelief at Mozart.

The music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed - amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound. Finally it fades down and away and changes into applause. Salieri opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>

The audience is clearly delighted. Mozart bows to them, also delighted. Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon. Count Arco approaches the composer. Mozart turns to him, radiant.

A group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At sight of the composer they break into sustained applause. Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open

so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing. The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox. Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God.

At the table sits the EMPEROR JOSEPH II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform. Around him but standing, are his Chamberlain, JOHANN VON STRACK: stiff and highly correct. COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera. BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties. FIRST KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy. And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual.

A somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study. We see a four-poster bed. Also, a marble mantelpiece above which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure of a severe Christ. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig. There is a knock at the door.

The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart, seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig. On either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding another wig, equally extravagant. Mozart takes off the first wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely proud, and hands it back.

The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first bars of it. Quite well.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>

The Majordomo bows and goes. The Emperor addresses himself to the march. He plays a wrong note.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S

Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching very slowly toward the salon door. He is followed by a bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of the wigs from the perruqier.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ROYAL PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S

Joseph finishes the march. The door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJORDOMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Herr Mozart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJORDOMO>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart comes in eagerly. Immediately the march begins, played by His Majesty. All the courtiers stand, listening with admiration. Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely to the manuscript. Mozart, still bewildered, regards the scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself. It finishes and all clap obsequiously.
</DIRECTION>
<ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bravo, Your Majesty!

</ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
<VON_STRACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done, Sire!

</VON_STRACK>
<DIRECTION>
The Emperor rises, pleased with himself. He snatches the manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the rest of the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<DIRECTION>
He extends his hand. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.

	He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps him out.

Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.

</JOSEPH>
<SALIERI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!

</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?

	Ah!

<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!

He bows elaborately. Salieri inclines himself, dryly.

<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure.

<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?

	Majesty!

<JOSEPH>

(to the courtiers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
<VON_STRACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we?

</VON_STRACK>
<VON_SWIETEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it was really decided, Director.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SWIETEN>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!

	Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.

He stops short with a little giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, where?

</JOSEPH>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.

</MOZART>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah-ha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean in Turkey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why especially does it have to be in German?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORSINI_ROSENBERG>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He giggles again. Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_SWIETEN>
<DIRECTION>
(kindly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_SWIETEN>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Joseph)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!

</MOZART>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm glad to hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love, Sire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think you do. I mean watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching. Stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about! That's not love - it's just rubbish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
An embarrassed pause. Bonno giggles in nervous amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Majesty, you choose the language. It will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Joseph is clearly pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there it is. Let it be German.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<DIRECTION>
He nods - he has wanted this result all the time. He turns and makes for the door. All bow. Then he becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, this is yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart does not take it.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? On one hearing only?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so, Sire, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPH>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the Emperor. Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself. The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
(to Salieri)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rest is just the same, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That really doesn't work, does it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
All the courtiers look at Salieri.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you try this? Wouldn't it be just a little more -?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He plays another phrase.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or this - yes, this! Better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He plays another phrase. Gradually, he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity. Salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. He finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph - and grins.

INT. BEDROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1780'S

He strikes the chord again, firmly. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.
</DIRECTION>

We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on:

INT. OPERA STAGE - VIENNA - 1780'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing the Pasha with scorn and defiance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is full. Watching the performance - which is conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so, Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen.

After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other - he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over it.

The curtains fall. Much applause. The Emperor claps vigorously and - following his lead - so do the courtiers. The curtains part. Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back.

The curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and chattering. Suddenly a hush. The Emperor is seen approaching from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles. Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow him. Also Salieri. The singers line up.

	Well, Herr Mozart! A good effort. Decidedly that. An excellent effort! You've shown us something quite new today.

Constanze curtsies. CU, of Cavalieri, astonished at the news. CU, of Salieri, watching her receive it.

He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his Chamberlain. All bow.

Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. Salieri watches. Mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber.

Constanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio. We see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water. Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage.
</DIRECTION>

Mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face. She is instantly revived by the shock. Constanze assists her to rise.

	It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.

There is a view of a castle in background. Leopold sits alone in his room. He is reading a letter from Wolfgang. At his feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not now take. We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented to him. We see a little starling in a wicker cage. And we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them.

	Most beloved father, it is done. Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face. I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it. Your every word is precious to me. Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians. To conquer here is to conquer Europe! With my wife I can do it. I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before. She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her. And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy. I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times.

Salieri stands waiting, hat in hand. Beside him stands a royal servant. Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride. Down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH. They are mounted on glossy horses. The Princess rides side-saddle. Running beside her is a panting groom. The Emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes. As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse. Salieri bows respectfully.

	Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall. It was clear to me. That sound I had heard in the Archbishop's palace had been no accident. Here again was the very voice of God! I was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink- strokes at an absolute, inimitable beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
The music swells. What we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and to us. The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them. We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce. More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in C Minor. It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut. Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head. He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, perplexed.

	Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You! I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.

	Herr Mozart, what brings you here?

</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.

Salieri looks at him in distress.

	Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?

	But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
	</DIALOGUE>

	They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!

	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms.

INT. MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG'S HOUSE - MORNING - 1780'S

Hysterical barking and howling. The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG. Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart.

Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle.

Mozart resumes playing. This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450. The dog howls immediately.

EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cheerful scene. We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons. Horses and carriage clatter past him. His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano.

Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.

INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - 1780'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he stops. He looks up the stairs. The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession. It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms.

INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S

A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.

Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.

The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539) sounds through all the following. This is an alternate song from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum. The vocal part should be arranged for trumpet.

This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades. It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds. Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to which is attached a full mask of dark grey. Its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile.

He turns and looks at his son through this mask.

INT. A LARGE PARTY ROOM - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball. Couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes. The music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and persists. We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers. A steer is being roasted. Through the bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves in his hair. He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men. Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask. This whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door. As they go, they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, wearing ordinary evening clothes. He turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them.
</DIRECTION>

As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray. He quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on.

INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles. A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to another tune. This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays. The music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has begun. Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is Salieri.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramble for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over- balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHIKANEDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no! You both lost. You both lost. You both have to forfeit. And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHIKANEDER>
<DIRECTION>
People are delighted by the idea of this penalty. The children jump up and down with excitement. The three actresses immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. Mozart takes off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls. Constanze laughingly surrenders it.

	No, please! This is ridiculous! No, please!

Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath. Another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head. The third actress takes Constanze's wig from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.

<DIRECTION>
As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig. Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the fun. Come on. Here, take mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.

<SCHIKANEDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHIKANEDER>
<DIRECTION>
Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty. Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking.

Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard. Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter.

The final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in E-flat (K. 482) begins. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street. Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction.

Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus. He is immensely excited. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them up.

Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet.

	Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence. Mozart lays down his baton. The musicians lay down their instruments.

The singers try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their conductor or from the accompaniment. Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre. Finally, the Emperor speaks, in a whisper.

The crowd all flock to Salieri with cries and words of approval. All want to shake his hand. They tug and pat him. But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, searching for him and then finds him. Mozart stands there. Eagerly Salieri moves to him.

Explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter the apartment, very pleased with themselves and accompanied by the three actresses. The front door opens, very gingerly. Mozart, still rather drunk, sticks his head into the room, anxious not to make a noise. He sees the strangers and breaks into a smile.

The second chord sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of a painted dining room set. The giant armoured statue of the COMMENDATORE enters pointing his finger in accusation at Don Giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring - his servant Leporello quaking with fear under the table.

Music swells up again. We watch the scene on stage as the Commendatore addresses Giovanni. Then back to Salieri in the box. Music down again.

Music swells. On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by the Statue's icy hand. Flames burst from obviously artificial rocks. Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell. The scene ends.

We see huge and attractive posters and billboards advertising Schikaneder's troupe. The camera concentrates on the one which reads as follows:

INT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1780'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening of vaudeville. Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe. They are rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard. Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates of sausages, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PARODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don Giovanni's palace, shown before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I), played by a quartet of tipsy musicians. Leporello is handing around wine on a tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside. The music slithers to a stop. All look at each other in panic. Leporello drops his tray with a crash. All go quiet. One more knock is heard. Then all musicians, actresses, Don Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table which is far too small to accommodate them all. The table rocks. Schikaneder is pushed out. He is terrified. He shakes elaborately. Three more knocks are heard; louder.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHIKANEDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHIKANEDER>
<DIRECTION>
One more knock.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHIKANEDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C-c-c-come in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHIKANEDER>
<DIRECTION>
In the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni turns into a anticipatory vamp. This grows more and more menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the back falls down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An absurd pantomime horse gallops in. It has a ridiculous expression, and is manned by four men inside. Standing precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore. He sings in a high, nasal voice:
</DIRECTION>
<COMMENDATORE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMENDATORE>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails. He falls off onto the stage. He beats at the horse, trying to get back on.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMENDATORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down! Down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMENDATORE>
<DIRECTION>
Bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his small rider who is below his level of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMENDATORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here! I'm here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMENDATORE>
<DIRECTION>
The horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate him. Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings. A tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders stands another man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw. There is a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don Giovanni. The two men bow to the applauding audience, and retire off-stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face Don Giovanni. This he finds difficult.

A trapeze sails in from above. On it stands a grand soprano wearing an elaborate Turkish costume, like a parody of Cavalieri's in Il Seraglio. She comes in singing a mad coloratura scale in the manner of Martern aller Arten.

The Commendatore pulls out his sword, reaches up and thrusts her through with it. The soprano collapses on the bar of the trapeze. The audience applauds. At the same moment eight dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water. They sing as they march to the sound of the march that was cut from Act III of Figaro. They are dressed as miniature copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are wearing cooks' hats.

</EIGHT_DWARVES>
<DIRECTION>
They set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage. The trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the chromatic scale from the Don Giovanni overture again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando. To this exciting vamp Schikaneder suddenly rides in on a real horse, waving a real sword. With this he cuts the string of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot. A tremendous splash of water. Schikaneder rides out. More applause.

All the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb up the sides of the pot. The three girls produce labeled bottles from under their skirts. The first is SALT.

The vamp starts again vigorously. The horse's rear-end swings around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to the audience. The rest of him stays sideways. His tail springs up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding his arsehole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay. The horse eats it, and out the other end comes a long Viennese sausage. The audience roars with laughter. Another handful of hay and out of the other end falls a string of sausages. Then a large pie, crust and all. Then a shower of iced cakes!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly - silence. Schikaneder produces an egg from his pocket. Ottavio the horse rears up in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMENDATORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Whoa, Ottavio! Whoa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMENDATORE>
<DIRECTION>
Leporello pries open the horse's mouth. Schikaneder pops the egg into it. A breathless pause as a drum roll builds the tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the horse's rear-end flies a single white dove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wild applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flies into the audience. Immediately all the cast start humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti. More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the theatre. Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins to eat. The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole company is dancing, frantically. A general dance as the curtain falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rises immediately. The audience - including Mozart - is delighted. They applaud vigorously. Schikaneder takes a bow amongst his troupe. Among much whistling and clapping, he finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience toward the table where Mozart sits with his family. On stage, a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old German tune. Some of the audience joins in singing it.

	'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.

This is exactly the same shop which Mozart and Constanze visited with Leopold. Now Salieri's servant stands in it, waiting. We see a few other customers being served by the staff: renting masks, costumes, etc. One of the staff emerges from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he hands to Salieri's servant. The servant leaves the shop. Through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy street full of passers-by, carriages, etc.

The D Minor Concerto continues. Salieri, alone, eagerly opens the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark cloak and hat that Leopold wore to the masquerade, only now attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a frown, not a laugh. It presents a bitter and menacing expression. He puts on the cloak, the hat and the mask and turns his back. Suddenly we see the assembled and alarming image reflected in a full-length mirror. The music swells darkly.

The dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us. The violent D Minor chord which opens Don Giovanni is heard. Salieri in costume stands in the doorway.

A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?

We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep. Mozart now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out. Tenderly he touches her hair. Then he moves to the cot where his son Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the boy's. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart rises and returns to:

The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue begins. Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait, and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. He is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. The music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door. The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the happy music. It ends. Before him stands the masked stranger.

She sits down tearfully, staring at him.

We hear the Rex Tremendai Majestatis from the Requiem and see on the wall the portrait of Leopold Mozart looking down. The camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table. Mozart is writing the music. He looks up and sees that Constanze is fast asleep in her chair. Mozart gets up quietly. He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and tiptoes from the house. Without stopping, the music changes from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.

This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the tenement by the Weiden. Inside, we see a table, chairs, a forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers. Strewn about in the chairs are the three actresses, giggling. Schikaneder and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird- people. The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard. Absurdly, they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.

	She's not coming back, you know. She's gone for good. I did it and I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said. 'Right away! Take he child and go, just go. Here's the money! Go to the Spa and get your health back - that's if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked to my foundation. Is that my girl? Can that be my Stanzi? The happy little moppet I brought up, that poor trembling thing? Oh, you monster! No one exists but you, do they? You and your music! Do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you? I warned her. 'Choose a man, not a baby,' I said. But would she listen? Who listens? 'He's just a silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse. Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish! Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish.

On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret. An audience of ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited.

The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies. In one of them sits Salieri.

We CUT TO the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein Madchen oder Weibchen. Papageno, played by Schikaneder, dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through a mysterious door. A voice calls from within.

In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take over as conductor. He slips from his place and goes stealthily backstage. We follow him. Over the scene we hear Papageno being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones.

Laughter. An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Mozart into the wings. Actors and actresses stand around in fantastic costumes. We see a flying chariot and parts of a huge snake lying about. Also the scenery door of a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment. Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it. Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the instrument himself.

On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the First Priest.

</PAPAGENO>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the audience and winks at them. They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins. It is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by Mozart. Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart conducting. He looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement. He sings joyfully and the audience watches entranced.

At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in the wings. Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and no sound comes. He mimes again, but still nothing comes. He looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion. People are looking down on the floor. The song comes to a near-halt. Schikaneder stares. Then the comedian signals to the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. At this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.

We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a hideous old woman over her face. She is looking worriedly down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor.

A few people around him are trying to revive him. One has put a wet handkerchief around his temples. Another is holding a small bottle of smelling salts. There are voices saying, 'Doctor! Take him to a dressing room. Someone call a carriage. Take him home.' Etc. Papagena is urged to go on stage by a distracted stage manager. Suddenly we hear the voice of Salieri.

They bob and curtsey. Schikaneder stares at Salieri, uneasily, vaguely suspicious. Salieri smiles back at him and shuts the door. He stays for a moment, thinking. He contemplates the money.

Mozart is sitting up in bed, staring at the door. It opens. Salieri returns. He holds in his hand the bag of money.

Salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet.

INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever. Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them.

<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Common time.

</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
Salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation. He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. His speed, however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind.

<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sing it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
Salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line. After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. They stop.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.

<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
His voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them. Salieri writes feverishly. We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page. The music stops again.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He hurriedly hums
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the opening notes of
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the bass vocal line)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first bassoon and tenor trombone -

<DIRECTION>
(labouring to keep up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! Just one moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart glares at him, irritated. His hands move impatiently. Salieri scribbles frantically.

<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It couldn't be simpler.

</MOZART>
<SALIERI>

(finishing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?

<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the tenors.

</MOZART>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also identical?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting. On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line. We also hear the trumpets and timpani. The sound is bare and grim. It stops at the end of the sixth measure. Salieri stops writing.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no. Now for the Fire.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.

He sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato.

<MOZART>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Second measure on B.

	Do you have me?

</MOZART>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
Salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
(excitedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, good - yes! Put it down. And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord. Do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
As Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment. They stop.
</DIRECTION>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's wonderful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.

He is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired.

	C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.

	Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.

</MOZART>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and on 'dictis'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALIERI>
<DIRECTION>
He writes feverishly.
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And underneath, just violins - arpeggio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
He sings the violin figure under the Voca Me (Bars 7,8,9).
</DIRECTION>
<MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again.

He sings the ostinato phrase twice.

<MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's it. Do you have it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOZART>
<DIRECTION>
The entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing. Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment. The music continues right through the following scenes, to the end of the movement.

Mozart lying in bed exhausted, but still dictating urgently. We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits writing assiduously. Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is pouring from his forehead.

Mozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop.

The carriage has arrived. Constanze and her son alight with other passengers. Postillions attend to the horses. She takes her boy's hand. It is a cold wintry dawn.

The music stutters to a close. End of the Confutatis.

Constanze and Karl approach along the cobbled street, hand in hand toward their house. Snow lies in the street.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart lies asleep in the bed, holding the last pages of the manuscript. Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat. The child's bed is obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped position.

Constanze and Karl arrive at the door. They enter.

INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN - 1790'S

It is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously littered with pages, is now completely bare. Constanze looks at it with surprise and enters the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mozart is asleep in the bed. Salieri is dozing on the nearby child's bed. The room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles. Startled by Constanze's entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up. As he does so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look absurd.

She notices a movement from the bed. Mozart wakes. He sees Constanze and smiles with real joy. Forgetting Salieri, she goes to her husband.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wolfi, I'm back. I'm still very angry with you, but I missed you so much.

She throws herself on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never leave you again. If you'll just try a little harder to be nice to me. And I'll try to do better, too. We must. We must! This was just silly and stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANZE>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs her husband desperately. He stares at her with obvious relief, not able to speak. Suddenly she sees the manuscript in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANZE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at it and recognizes it.

<CONSTANZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, not this. Not this, Wolfi! You're not to work on this ever again! I've decided.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANZE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes it from his weak hand. At the same moment Salieri reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him, trying to understand - suspicious and frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound. Mozart makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages. The coins brought by Salieri fall on the floor. Karl runs after them, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANZE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not his handwriting.

	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.

<CONSTANZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.

She extends her hand for the Requiem, as she stands up. Salieri hesitates.

<DIRECTION>
(hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.

</CONSTANZE>
<DIRECTION>
With extreme reluctance - it costs him agony to do it - Salieri hands over the score of the Requiem to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANZE>
<DIRECTION>
She marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the room, opens it, throws the manuscript inside, shuts the lid, locks it and pockets the key. Involuntarily Salieri stretches out his arms for the lost manuscript.

She moves to the bed. The child is playing with the coins on the floor. Faintly we hear the start of the Lacrimosa from the Requiem. Salieri watches as she touches her husband's hand. As the music grows, we realize that Mozart is dead.

CU, Constanze staring wide-eyed in dawning apprehension.

EXT. STEPHEN'S CATHEDRAL - VIENNA - A RAINY DAY - 1790'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lacrimosa continues through all of the following: a small group of people emerges from the side door into the raw, wet day, accompanying a cheap wooden coffin. The coffin is borne by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes. They load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse. All the rest are in black, also: Salieri, Von Swieten, Constanze and her son, Karl, Madame Weber and her youngest daughter Sophie, and even Lorl, the maid. It is drizzling. The cart sets off. The group follows.

The group has already passed beyond the city limits following the miserable cart. The Lacrimosa accompanies them with its measured thread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drizzle of rain has now become heavy. One by one, the group breaks up and shelters under the trees. The cart moves on toward the cemetery, alone, followed by nobody, growing more and more distant. They watch it go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Salieri and Von Swieten shake hands mournfully, the water soaking their black tall hats. Schikaneder is in tears. Constanze is near collapse. Salieri moves to assist her, but she turns away from him, seeking the arm of Cavalieri. Madame Weber takes Karl's hand.

The music builds to its climax on Dona Eis Pacem! We CUT back to:

INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING - 1823

Morning light fills the room. Old Salieri sits weeping convulsively, as the music stops. Tears stream down his face. Vogler watches him, amazed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGLER>
<OLD_SALIERI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.

The rain has eased off. A LOCAL PRIEST with two boy acolytes is standing beside an open communal grave. Mozart's body is lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack.

We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks. The gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the others. An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of them. The acolytes swing their censers.

He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and throws it across the room.

	Being bowed to and saluted, called 'distinguished - distinguished Salieri' - by men incapable of distinguishing! Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct. My music growing fainter, all the time fainter, until no one plays it at all. And his growing louder, filling the world with wonder. And everyone who loves my sacred art crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.

	Goodbye, Father. I'll speak for you. I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint. On their behalf I deny Him, your God of no mercy. Your God who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill. He may forgive me: I shall never forgive Him.

The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks, all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses and nuns. They form a long, wretched, strange procession - some of them are clearly very disturbed. As Old Salieri is pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to them in benediction.
