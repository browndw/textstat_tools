of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon, heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to see --

<DIRECTION>
FACE OF SARA JOHNSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
17, pressed at one of its windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - REFLECTION IN TRAIN'S WINDOW - SARA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - MOVING - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A zaftig BLACK WOMAN clumsily negotiates the aisle. Stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This seat taken?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking up, around. She shakes her head, clears her backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap. Tries to make conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love ballet. Never had the body for it. Do you dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara gazes out the window. The world outside begins to dissolve melting into images from another time, another place. Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her memories.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. AUDITORIUM - KINDERGARTEN RECITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stage full of five-year-olds in tights and tutus. A little girl performs center stage. She's remarkably poised, remarkably good. CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint of the necklace's gold. Mommy. She flashes a megawatt smile, ends the dance with an unscripted bow, as we...

<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLET CLASS - EVENING (FIVE YEARS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Sara, lithe and earnest, dances. A budding beauty blessed with long limbs and natural grace, she makes it look easy. Gliding past the envious stares of classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold. Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn, stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S EXETER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17, dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a preoccupied frown on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? It was good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<SARA>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody there's going to be good, Mom. I have to be better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, beginning again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My knees still knock when I do my free form. Did you notice that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noticed that it was fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(escalating frustration)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not supposed to be fine. It's supposed to be special. And it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. I bet they notice that. That it doesn't do anything. That I don't do anything special enough to get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara. You'll get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't lie because you love me. My free form sucks.

</SARA>
<GLYNN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got something for you. Come on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes shut. No pouting. No peeking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara flops down on the sofa beside her. Closes her eyes. Glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it around Sara's.
</DIRECTION>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For luck tomorrow. Not that you'll need it. You dance like an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
The necklace is Glynn's talisman. Sara knows what it means to her. She throws her arms around Glynn, holds onto her tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the necklace but you're still the best luck I'll ever have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up. They cling to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMTRAK TRAIN (MOVING) - ON SARA - DUSK (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the blink of her eyes, the memory fades. She pulls the window shade, shifts in her seat. Her fingers travel to the clover necklace at her throat. Linger. The Woman regards her.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice... the necklace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. It's a good luck charm. Doesn't always work.

FLASHBACK - INT./EXT. BUS/RURAL ROAD - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of young white faces. A jock entertains the troops with two straws up his nose. Sara sits next to her best friend, LINDSAY, 17. Lindsay, chomping on a wad of gum, turns from the jock to Sara with a bubble in bloom, bursts it with her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna pray? You're leaving for Philly after first period. I won't see you. We should pray.

(stupefied)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lindsay... no. Not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Lindsay grabs Sara's hand and bows her head. Sara, embarrassed, aligns her head with Lindsay's. She's praying nobody sees them.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDSAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Awesome, Father, S.J. auditions today. She's ready for them. Please make them ready for her. Even if she screws up. Thanks. Amen.'

EXT. EXETER SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - LATER THAT MORNING

Sara exits with a bouquet of roses, takes the steps two and three at a time. Glynn's waiting in a flower van at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. FLOWER VAN (DRIVING)/RESIDENTIAL STREETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Glynn. The back of the van is filled with flower arrangements. Glynn takes note of the roses in Sara's hand.

<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get those, traitor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He actually told me to break a leg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roses from the principal, even droopy, out-of-season yellow ones, is beyond cool, kiddo. You're definitely movin' up in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks through the windshield. It's starting to drizzle.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what would be great? If you didn't drop me off at the bus station. If we just kept going until we get to Philly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruin everyone's Valentine's Day and not have a shop when I get back. That's your definition of great? I can see the headline now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit Mother.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, we talked about this. I'll get there as soon as I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. This is the hardest, most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can. Thanks, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION (READING, PA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glynn pulls the van into the parking lot. Smiles at Sara. Sara doesn't smile back. She's too angry. Too scared.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I guess I'll see you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't miss your audition, Sara. I'll be there, okay? If I have to swim the Susquehanna, I'll be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swim? You can't swim, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<GLYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll float then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLYNN>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. They look at each other. Sara finally smiles. They embrace and she hops out the van. Glynn calls after her.

INT. AMTRAK TRAIN (MOVING) - ON SARA - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feigning sleep. From the corner of her eye, she watches the Woman beside her flip through the American Ballet Magazine. We move back in time through their pages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA - WAITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara, in costume, flips through a magazine. She taps her toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers are clustered around a sign posted on the door: JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it. Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks toward her. Where's her mother?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA - STAGE/AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S "Elvira Madigan" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical. She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly impressed. One of them looks directly at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anything you'd like to share about your free form before you begin? A motif... a theme?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme. Shit!
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER. Sara tries to elevate her body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm. Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling, recovering, and finally finishing with those damned knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones, perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year. Sara chokes two words out...
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Rushes backstage. Fighting tears, she hurries past waiting dancers angrily unhooking the clover leaf chain from her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara in street clothes. Cramming her ballet gear into a duffle bag when the official (of the clipboard) approaches her. She touches Sara's shoulder gently. Says something we do not hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE (UNIV. OF PA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING THROUGH office window. A state trooper in a rain slicker offers Sara a chair. She sits. The trooper talks. As he does, dread and disbelief spread over Sara's face. She shakes her head, attempts to stand. Her legs buckle beneath her. The trooper and the official catch her as she falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glowing moon in a clear, star-specked sky.

CHUGS toward Baltimore's Penn Station, which is visible in the f.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - INTERCUT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A torrential rain. A flower van -- Glynn's van -- caught in it. SHOOTING THROUGH the driver's side window, we can see Glynn's face, intense and determined, squinting through the downpour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRAIN'S WHEELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRINDING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAN'S WHEELS
</DIRECTION>

Hydro-planing, slip-sliding.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's SQUEAL OF BRAKES as it maneuvers into the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SQUEAL of its BRAKES as Glynn loses control and smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of her.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
across space and time, the SOUND OF SQUEALING BRAKES commingle as the Amtrak Commuter pulls into Penn Station.
</DIRECTION>

INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Sara. Holding her breath, clenching her fists. Waiting for the sound to stop, oblivious to the stare of the Woman beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PENN STATION (BALTIMORE) - PLATFORM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain style, takes a last drag from his cigarette, drops and stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy searches their faces. They all look like strangers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the train's engine is sucked into the fog. She walks through it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves. Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly advance. She wants to run. Can't.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.

Sara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slept through most of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Roy looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you got stuff. Baggage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two suitcases. One big one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like they're unloading. -- You hungry? We can stop somewhere if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kinda tired.

</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Roy takes her backpack. They walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP/STREET - SARA AND ROY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy silence. Roy starts to turn on the radio, stops himself. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't like leavin' you so soon after the funeral. I wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. I mean, I could've hung around. Helped you say good-bye. That's what you were doin', wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I figured you were doin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara peers out the windshield. Baltimore City. The neighborhoods are changing. The streets are getting progressively gritty and dirty. It surprises her. It worries her. Roy worries her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. You don't have to pretend this is easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's upside down right now but don't worry. We'll work this bachelor-father thing out. Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. We got a pretty good idea about each other, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating otherwise. A moment. Roy's too new at this to hold up both ends of the conversation. The silence deepens. Roy switches on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOND STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses with pristine white marble steps. He and Sara each lug a suitcase from the truck. Her eyes wander up and down the street. They're on the fringes of a ghetto. A few people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. All of them have black faces.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you were moving to Fells Point.

</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fell through.

</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second floor of a two-story house has been turned into a one-bedroom studio. A partition separates the living area from the bedroom. Sara walks past a collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of herself. Aside from the saxophones and the pictures, there's hardly any furniture. Roy lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much of what you're used to. But the water's hot and the fridge is full. And I made room in the closets for you. Girl's gotta have closets, right? You even get your own bed. I'll crash on the couch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bought a bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
<DIRECTION>
(slight bow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me. Your own futon. Check it out. On the other side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Suitcase in hand, Sara walks around the partition. Her "room" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. She stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do. She removes framed photos of Glynn from her backpack, places them around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara walks in. Doesn't see Roy. Calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a phone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>

Roy emerges from the bathroom drying his hands, walks past her.

<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I have a phone.

</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't at the last place. The last place I saw anyway.

</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things change. You've changed. You grew up on me. Overnight.

	Are you alright, Sara?

(off the scowl in her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanna know how you feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel fine. I feel like calling Lindsay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She's a wall. A brick wall. Roy's head aches from knocking into it. He goes to the couch. Drops down. Mutters at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phone's in the kitchen. Knock yourself out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S ROOM/BATHROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip quivering. She slips out of bed, creeps on tiptoes into the bathroom. Closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her. She flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on both faucets. As the water flows and the PIPES RATTLE, the brick wall shatters. Sara crumbles to the floor. Buries her head in her arms. Cries like a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap. Then, finally.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can take the school bus. Tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>

	School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk.

<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I know how to do both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not around here you don't. Not until you get the hang of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. It's all to obvious, the hang of things. Roy glances over at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called about your transcripts. You're all set. Patterson's got a pretty good Humanities program. No ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school --

</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Roy can hear the lie behind her words. The pain too. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window. He wants to say the right thing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good idea. Take a break. Not too long a break though. You're a dancer. You should dance. Stay on top of your art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you stay on top of yours?

EXT. PATTERSON HIGH SCHOOL (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - MORNING

Formidably large and surprisingly well-kept, Patterson serves the nearby, predominantly black O'Donnell Heights Projects. Kids malinger outside on the front steps and lawn.

<DIRECTION>
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy's pickup pulls in. Roy CUTS the ENGINE. Sara looks at him. Or through him. She won't let his eyes connect.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>

Roy regards her with weary resignation. Sara climbs out. He calls after her.

EXT./INT. PATTERSON HIGH - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara moving TOWARD us PAST a floating mosaic of black faces. This is a near out-of-body experience for her. She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff straight line to the school's entrance. It's clogged with students. Inside the doorway, two security guards flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and wordlessly begins searching it. He hands it back to her on the other side of the detector where Sara stands obtusely and mutely amazed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Gwynn looks at her squarely. But the brick wall doesn't move an inch. Sara feels too safe behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching new textbooks, Sara starts down the hallway. She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic in her heart. She's surrounded. Alone. Every inch of her feels afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she MOVES FORWARD. A crush of KIDS -- mostly black with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in. Kids like her. Only they don't dress like her. They dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. And they definitely don't sound like her...
</DIRECTION>
<TEENAGER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, man, check it, the muthafuckers wasn't playin', they was jackin'. Ten rides in five days. For real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEENAGER_1>
<TEENAGER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fools got caught for real too. Ten years in five days. Stall that shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEENAGER_2>
<DIRECTION>
Sara walks on, taking this netherworld in, eavesdropping on other conversations. It's not just the words. It's how they say them: Loud. Matter-of-fact. Cool. A cooler cool. Like they breathe static electricity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's it! The entire student body is energized. Sara's thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by. One clips Sara's elbow as she passes, knocking it against a locker. They keep going as if they don't see her. No one seems to see her. Welcome to mass avoidance at Patterson High.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT SARA'S LOCKER - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's back is to a black girl striding purposefully toward her. CHENILLE -- tall, pretty, with about a million braids in her hair -- swoops Sara's backpack from the floor. Thrusts it at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how easy it is to give to charity around here. Don't put your shit on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(cautions a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her locker, starts to say something else. She's eager to make a friend. One friend. But Chenille's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara memorizes the schedule of classes in her hand. She passes a clutch of students who surround a kid in the middle like a horseshoe. Sara gets a fleeting glimpse of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA'S POV - PATRICK REYNOLDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye candy: Tall. Dark. Heartbreakingly handsome. If Patterson were a monarchy, Patrick would be king. He sure holds court like one, turning on his dazzling smile and abundant charm for the crowd. One gets the sense that the All-American Home Boy is almost as enraptured with himself as the sycophants around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JURASINSKI'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room's seen better days. Probably better teachers too. MR. JURASINSKI looks out at his American Literature class and sees nothing but tenure.
</DIRECTION>
<JURASINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Cold Blood represents a turning point in our country's literature. Take the cap off and tell me why that is, Mr. Ricard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JURASINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER to include the class. FAVOR "SNOOKIE" RICARD. We recognize him from the hallway kids wrapped up in Patrick. Snookie, a flagrant Patrick wannabe, sits next to him now. He removes his baseball cap. Thoughtfully twirls it on a finger. He truly believes he's being profound.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gay rights. That Compote dude who wrote it? Sweet tooth. Straight- up fag, Mr. J.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<JURASINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mr. Ricard. Your genius grant is in the mail. Anyone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JURASINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
No volunteers. Jurasinski looks for someone to put on the spot. Sees the new girl in a back corner. Johnson. He gets into her line of sight. The class shifts in their seats, peeping her.
</DIRECTION>
<JURASINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms... Johnson. You can catch up later. If this is over your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JURASINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks at her. The way kids look at new kids.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a non-fiction novel. The first of its kind. Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
A small murmur goes up. Over this, the voice of a dissenter.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	White folks back then felt safe. Capote scared 'em. He took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in America's back yard. That's what makes the book special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara cranes to see him. God. It's pretty-boy. He's sitting on the other side of the classroom. Looking... pretty. Looking at her. He has nice eyes. Not that she noticed.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That is part of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all of it. Capote wasn't first. Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same thing. Wasn't nobody tryin' to read them though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of people read them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
A defensive save. Patrick sees right through it.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of people like who? You? Hello. Didn't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. J.! Girl needs to bone up. Give her a pass to the lib'ary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
The room erupts in laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flushed in the face. Embarrassed. Pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WIDENS as Jurasinski quiets the class. Then.
</DIRECTION>
<JURASINSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She can have your pass, Mr. Ricard. Since you obviously never use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JURASINSKI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAFETERIA - NOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lunchtime. PICK UP Sara among a cattle drive of boisterous students.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAFETERIA - FOOD LINE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of voices unleashed in pure, unadulterated teenage cacophony. Sara's in a queue of kids, working her way down the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's as invisible and anonymous as ever. CAMERA TRACKS her FROM the line, TO the cashier, INTO the heart of the dining hall. She stands with a food tray, looking for a place to sit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Table cliques of the cafeteria.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOCK TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two tables pushed together. Full.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NERD TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely, pathetically populated but surprisingly diverse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIP-HOP TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud, overflowing, fun. King Patrick and his loyal subjects horse around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POPULAR TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over which a glacial beauty we will come to know as NIKKI DAVIS presides. Girls only.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Notable for its glaring absence of color. A girl we will come to know as TONI sits there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then PUSHING IN ON --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHENILLE'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's there with a group of girls who eschew pretense. They, like Chenille, are rugged and regular. They know who they are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyeing Chenille's table. Screwing up courage as she approaches it. She gets there but two black girls are faster. They sit down in the only empty seats. Sara backs off, invisible again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CHENILLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glimpsing Sara from the corner of her eye as Sara walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT NERDS' TABLE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time has passed. The cafeteria is half as full, half as noisy. Sara sits among the NERDS, a friendly if verbose group. She's trying to eat but a snooze button is talking her to death...
</DIRECTION>
<WONK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I know you're new to the table, but think about it. We're the Y2K generation and nobody takes us seriously. We don't take ourselves seriously. Just look around. Half the student body is D.O.A. -- and that's from the neck up, Clara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WONK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara. It's Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's Sara. And you're boring her from the ears down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks up, surprised to see Chenille standing there. She flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates Sara's tray.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You finished?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod. Beats a hasty retreat from the table. As she and Chenille walk through the cafeteria, Sara shudders with relief. She feels rescued.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God! Thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta watch where you sit, girl. And it's Chenille. But you're still welcome. Let's catch some air before the bell rings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara follows Chenille into the "QUAD," four squared off sections outside the cafeteria. There are a few dry- rotted picnic tables scattered around. Other kids -- and they run the gamut -- are seen in clots, sneaking smokes... horsing around... making out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA'S POV - KIDS OF QUAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And OVER the sound of HIP-HOP MUSIC, a pair of feet. Moving. Dancing. CAMERA PANS UP to reveal Nikki. She's demonstrating some moves to the girls from the popular table. Nikki's dancing her ass off, showing off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it called? What she's doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dance.

</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(a look; knows that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean... the step, the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She trails off as she catches someone in the corner of her eye. She turns away from Chenille, gradually focusing on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
playing cards with Snookie at one of the picnic tables. He glances up to see Sara. Glowering at him. He grins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Mutters loudly to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole beaucoup. In this crowd, you gotta be more specific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(covertly indicates Patrick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in one of my classes. Thinks he's so... smart. So cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about cute but he is smart. Real smart. Real trip, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick Reynolds? Hell yeah, I know him. He's my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille waits for Sara to swallow her tongue. Enjoys a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE SHIFTS TO PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Nikki approaches him. Sexy, standoffish and conceited, she's the stuff of wet dreams and futile longing. She sits down next to Patrick. Close to him. Snookie watches her, much amused.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You comin' tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick keeps playing his hand. Responds very coolly.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already skipped three meetings.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he's ignoring her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it because of me? Everybody on the committee thinks it's because of me. Us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(infuriated by his silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Patrick. Regardless. You're in charge of the music. I'm in charge of the prom. So show up. Don't make me fire your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting words. Snookie holds his breath. Patrick throws out a card, turns slowly to Nikki with a withering stare in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already fired my ass, Nikki. Once and done. Over. Out. 'Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She stalks off. Snookie oogles her departure, peers at Patrick, about to say something. Patrick cuts him off, indicates cards.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me and shut the hell up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'ma shut up... after I say it been real frigid 'round here since y'all broke up. 'Specially since she broke up with you. That was harsh, way she canceled your ass like a stamp for that Howard U dude. But their shit's over. Now might be the time to forget mistakes that was made. Shoot. You been with the girl since ninth grade.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Why you sweatin' me, Snookie?

(pounding his heart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I'm about you, man. I want a happy ending. Aww, shit. Tuck an' duck. Here he comes. The hood of the 'hood, up to no good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALAKAI RHINEHART, 17, heading toward them. Powerfully built and edgy with insolence, Malakai is like a tightly- wound coil -- you never know when he's going to snap. ANGLE WIDENS and we see Patrick is happy to see him. He and Malakai grin at each other. Knock handshakes.
</DIRECTION>

<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up and step your lame ass off, Snookie. You heard me. Space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>

Snookie haughtily, comedically obliges. A moment.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you at lunch, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Short-hand. Patrick understands it, nods. Malakai slips the cigarette from behind his ear, openly lights and starts smoking it. CAMERA TRACKS them walking back toward Patterson.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're hangin' in, man? Feelin' strong about being back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at this motherfucker. Out a week and where am I? Fucking home sweet high school. Jail away from jail. You can have it.

	Judge says it's school or JuVee and I sure as hell ain't goin' back there. Shit. I never knew a year could be such a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
A flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses Patrick's face. They're at the doors now. Most of the kids have gone. Malakai puts his cigarette out on the floor as they step in.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You up for some hoops after school? Break your free-throw back in. Chump the chumps like we used to.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - THAT DAY (AFTER SCHOOL)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara exits with Chenille. A CAR HORN starts to blare. Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille looks at Sara. Then at Roy.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your old man? Now he's cute.

Sara climbs in, slams the door. Roy looks over at her, unaware of how annoyed she is with him. She's a clenched fist inside.

Sara's moving the partition around, trying to make her room more like a room. Trying to build another wall between her and Roy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sara. C'mere a minute.

It's full of frozen dinners. They're in unruly, lopsided stacks.

Roy, deflated, closes the freezer door, trails her into the living area. Sara's clenching again. There's no escaping him.

Roy's gone. Sara takes her first good look around. A mess. It drives home where she is. What she's lost. It's overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON EMPTY T.V. DINNER TRAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty beer bottle, one askew kitchen chair. Vestiges of Roy's meal. ANGLE WIDENS as Sara enters. She opens the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche of falling food. A box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at her feet. Something else out of place. She picks it up, jams everything back into the freezer. Slams the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOCK CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a whirlwind, cleaning the apartment. Wall to wall. Scrubbing away what's churned up inside. The dervish ends in her "room," where she finishes unpacking. Several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet shoes. The sight hits her like a slap in the face. Sara stares at the shoes until her eyes blur. Then she snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick, Chenille, Snookie straggle through the dreary jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the way to school. It's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere.

Patrick finally laughs. Then his face changes. Becomes serious. He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them. They continue on like this, the ruins of their world in the b.g. behind them.

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT CITY BUS/BALTIMORE STREETS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus is crammed with kids. Sara, seated by a window, doesn't bother looking out. Inside's more interesting. The kids cut up. Singing, rapping, and jousting with each other. Some even manage to read. Sara watches with immunity. She's invisible to them.
</DIRECTION>

Patrick and Chenille pass through metal detectors, watch Snookie clown his way through. The security guard shakes his head. All three begin to walk. Snookie, bobbing and jiving, doesn't see Mrs. Gwynn coming up from behind. Her voice stops him cold.

The class has donned lab coats and is ready to begin when Sarah rushes in. She tries to slink into a seat. The teacher, MR. HILL, gives her a disapproving look, points at one of several formulas (C2,H6,O2) on the blackboard. Sara just looks at him
</DIRECTION>

	We're cooking today, Ms. Johnson. This is your first lab. You'll need a partner. Mr. Reynolds -- Patrick -- will show you the ropes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HILL>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick bounces a smile off unsettled Sara. This should be fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The class, in safety goggles and gloves, has partnered up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SARA AND PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's holding two vials. Sara picks up a beaker. Stares at the blackboard. She has no idea -- and no intention of admitting it.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(very casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She glints at him, grits through her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's too big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the beaker down. Picks up a vial. Flips through her textbook. Her eyes shift from it to the blackboard, trying to make a connection. She settles on one. Picks up a vial of powder. Patrick grabs her hand, leans over and whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't do that if I were you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(yanks her hand back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who died and made you teacher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick pulls back, looks at her. He can't believe she dissed him. A small smile forms on his face. Sara turns away from it, goes back to her vials. Patrick slides to the farthest end of the table. Watches her consternation with bemusement.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? Both got three elements, two parts the same. It's that first part, C2 versus C3. C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat. Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? Everybody back in your seats!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HILL>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick stares at Sara. Her face is red. She's biting her lip.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I misread the component.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MR_HILL>
<DIRECTION>
(even more angry now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You? You misread a component. Don't give me that, Patrick. You were screwin' around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HILL>
<DIRECTION>
Hill's tone is searing. He turns to Sara. She's trying to say something but the words won't come out. Hill regards her wearily, then walks off pushing the curious class back to their stations. Sara looks at Patrick, weakly mouths "thanks."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the sound of GRUNTING... OPEN CLOSE ON a girl's plump ass. Squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug the cheeks. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a stout white girl on a balance beam. Trying to get her legs to stand up on it. Hanging on for dear life. From somewhere around her, a WHISTLE BLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, Ms. Diggs. Time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN to see the teacher and her class (FAVOR Sara, Chenille, and Nikki). Amid snickers, the stout girl ("DIGGY") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher with her head demurely cast down. Clearing the teacher, Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air. Gives up the double bird with much attitude. The class loves it. Cheers it. Until the teacher swerves around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF CLOSE CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille on balance beam. competent but average.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki on balance beam. Agile. Self-assured. Good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... And then TIGHTER STILL on Sara. Tentatively approaching the balance beam. Mindful of all the eyes on her, all the bated breaths. All waiting to see the new girl fall on her ass. Sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb. Her legs and body are strong, supple, pliable rubber bands. She flounces across it on her tiptoes. Does a flawless split. Hops off. Looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA'S POV - TEACHER AND CLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reacting with shock and surprise. Awed. Except for Nikki. She stands there with her arms folded. Simmering. Envious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATTERSON HIGH - END OF SCHOOL THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara. Heading down the steps with other students. Chenille and Diggy break through the logjam, catch up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girl, how you get your legs to twist like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIGGY>
<DIRECTION>
(wildly gesticulating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. What was all that double- jointed cheerleader shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Diggy. Thinks she's down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Egg-cuse me? I am down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Sara. What's up with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille makes an impressed face. Regards Sara curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Un-der-ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on and hang out. Snook dee's sometime. He can get you in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, Snook
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara sees Snookie... then Patrick... loping her way. She steels herself. He's going to say something, crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up. But Patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. A nice twinkle. Sara's not entirely immune to it. Chenille breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside. She grabs Snookie's arm, indicates Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She needs to get hooked up for Feetz. All the way up. Sara, give Snook twenty dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I.D. Eye-dee. How you think you gettin' in? On your looks?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rolling his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chenille, your girl is weak. Shit. I got my rep to watch. I can't just be gettin' any green in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara glares. Regards Snookie with a sweeping scowl.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Snookie's jaw drops. Patrick cracks up. Diggy too. Chenille's stays on point. She's about solving the problem.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna pay the man or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ain't got it. Look at her. Loud-talkin' me and broke as a damn promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara, put on the spot, pulls out the money. Snookie snatches it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know where it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we'll hook up at my house. Go together. I will have your I.D.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Snookie shrugs affirmatively. Patrick looks directly at Sara. The twinkle in his eye is gone, replaced by fair warning.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feetz ain't no square dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. I dance in circles. Probably around you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy walks in to see Sara on the futon in her pajamas reading a book. She's got a head full of rollers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm splittin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she barely looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatcha readin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chemistry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're takin' chemistry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now it's taking me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give yourself some time. Well. See ya in the mornin'. Maybe I'll call between sets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara really looks up. Gives him an angelic, sluggish shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. As soon as Sara hears the front DOOR CLOSE, she jumps up, strips down to bra and panties, races to the closet. One hand rips the rollers from her hair, the other rips through outfits. She's frantic and unsure about choosing the right one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "BLACK" STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara. In a skin-tight miniskirt and a bolero jacket. Looking more eighties than nineties, more cute than cool. She walks with tentative, jittery purpose down this poverty stricken street. Doesn't meet anyone's eye. But can feel the eyes on her. She keeps going. She's walked too far to turn back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PROJECTS - SARA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching the malignant edifices as the Heights begin to come to life... or death, depending how luck's running. Sara walks into this world of shadows and despite a trepidation, finds something fascinating about the possibility of real danger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. REYNOLDS APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille triple unlocks the door, lets Sara in. Sara's surprised -- the apartment is surprisingly quaint and extremely neat. It looks a helluva lot better than Roy's place. Chenille is dressed in hugely baggy military- style pants and a tube top with a form-fitting, short-cut leather coat over it. Sara takes it in.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool outfit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slammin'. Slammin' outfit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I look okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille gives her the once over. Decides to lie.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You look okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moma Dean. I'm leavin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDMOMMA DEAN enters with a toddler ("CHRISTOPHER") in her arms. She sports snow white, waist-length dreads and she's wearing a dashiki lounger. Despite her white locks, she doesn't look old enough to be a grandmother. She hands Christopher to Chenille. Inspects Sara. Her eyes are open, kind.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
(fussing over Christopher)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandmom, Sara. Sara, Grandmom. Also known as Momma Dean. And handsome here is Christopher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<MOMMA_DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. Now don't get him all riled up, Chenille. I want to get some sleep tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOMMA_DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille kisses Christopher, hands him off to Momma Dean. They exit. Sara looks tentatively at Chenille.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that... is he... yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sure ain't Momma Dean's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CAB/STREET (MOVING) - SARA AND CHENILLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've been talking. Well, Chenille has. Sara's been listening. Intently. Liking this confidence they're sharing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... He'll be one in July. Best mistake I ever made. Kenny -- Christopher's father -- he's the worst. Triflin'. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 6TH AND BROADWAY (EAST BALTIMORE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A curbed cab. Sara and Chenille get out. Chenille digs into her pocketbook, hands Sara her I.D. PUSH IN ON photo of obese white girl with an untamed trailer trash perm. Sara's eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chenille. She's ugly. She's fat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's twenty-one too. I ain't got all night. Let's hop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I have to ask you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hard for her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I really look alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
An unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme that '89 Madonna shit. Your jacket. Give it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara takes off the bolero. Chenille ties it around her own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her hips. Sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee. Chenille frowns at it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's from the GAP.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's country. You look country in it. Take it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not walking in there in my bra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille thrusts her leather coat at her. Sara can't believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public street! She pulls off the tee, slips on Chenille's coat. Buttons it as far as the buttons go. Looks down. Half her chest is exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY (EAST BALTIMORE) - SARA AND CHENILLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse. Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to get inside.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rope dopes. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
She leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes gold-capped teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DOORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chenille. Lookin' fine. As always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOORMAN>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too fine to stand in line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the $10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's back with a smirk.
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Changed your hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
He waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet another door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They march a short distance to an old elevator where a group of kids wait. Bouncer #2 engages the elevator. Everyone piles in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara holds onto her stomach as the CREAKY ELEVATOR descends and the MUSIC below rises. The elevator's vibrating with music.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(an inside to Chenille)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't get much more underground than this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids. Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting in. They share a common goal: To clog the dance floor, flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the masters: Tupac Shakur, NAS, Lauryn Hill, Puff Daddy, etc. Here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed, from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she has to shout to be head over the music.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and I hafta hurt somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's bewildered. She doesn't see any tables. She follows Chenille to the back of FEETZ. Sees six or seven tables. All of them have reserved signs. Most of them are filled.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille indicates the deejay booth. Snookie's in it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snook hooks me up whenever he dees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
They walk past a SLACKER in lycra pants and a big Army shirt. He licks his tongue at Chenille, grabs at her protruding butt. She swirls around, grabs his crotch hard enough to get his attention. The Slacker is squirming in her clutch.
</DIRECTION>
<SLACKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw'right, aw'right. You got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLACKER>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he can't think of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	anything but the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
squeeze on his balls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The right to walk past your greasy, tickle dick self without your paws on my ass? 'S'that how I got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille bobs her head right in his face. Sara can't believe it. A few people have stopped and are looking. The Slacker nods hastily. Chenille releases him, gently smoothes out his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how I thought I had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a fly wave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
She and Sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables. Stop at a reserved one. An adjacent table sports Nikki, her three girl crew... and Diggy. All nurse drinks. Nikki snake-eyes Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is up with this place? Seems like they're lettin' anybody in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And they started with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
The three girls and Diggy snicker. Nikki gives Chenille a look. Turns back to Sara with a snide smirk. Points out her crew.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Nikki. Alyssa. Jasmin. Tiff'nee. You know Diggy, right, Marsha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That don't mean you know me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit it, Nikki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit what? I ain't walkin' on eggshells just 'cause you brought the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(kiss-my-ass polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you came to the wrong spot, Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille cracks up mainly to back Sara up. Nikki glowers at her.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty sure you came with one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did not just call me a Negro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
As Chenille bucks, Diggy springs up from her seat, runs her arm in the space between Chenille and Nikki like a referee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, y'all. Chill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her to chill. She always got somethin' to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can say a lot more. Keep runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll lay all your shit bare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any chances. She ejects herself from the table, walks off. The three girls scoot loyally after her. Diggy gets up. Sits down at Sara's and Chenille's table. Diggy goes with the flow. That's why she always fits in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you burn her like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother. I need a drink, Sara. Let's walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - ENTRANCE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick and Malakai enter with two high school dropouts we will learn are ARVEL and LIP. Females flock to flirt with Patrick and Malakai, who both swell like sponges, soaking up the attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - BAR - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging Sara along. A tall, angular twenty-something MAN on the far side of the bar sees her. She sees him. Sucks her teeth, nudges Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's him. Comin' over. Kenny? Don't look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
So of course Sara does. She makes a silly face at Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her. Chenille rolls her eyes half-heartedly.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(MAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my money, Kenny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little short this week. Don't jump off. It's comin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's comin'? No. You lyin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. She's in love with him. Enough to let him whisper in her ear, sweet-talk her away from the bar. Before she's swallowed up by the crowd, Chenille turns back to Sara, shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rum and Coke. No ice. Hook me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
ON PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
splitting off from Malakai and a girl clinging to him. He's walking through when Nikki appears from nowhere, grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? It's gonna be like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you think it was gonna be? That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't all that serious, Patrick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't anymore, Nikki. Not to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks off. CAMERA TRACKS him going deep inside the club. He wants a drink. He's almost at the bar when he sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny. She shrugs a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. Toward Sara. The look is like, help me out. Don't let me leave her hangin'. Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at Sara, before he really sees her. She looks fly. Hugely fly. He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad choice. 'Anything.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The closeness of his voice startles her. She turns into his smile. That cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees smile.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it should be the best beer. You'd know that if you really drank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens. The asshole's back.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that mean? Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles at this, at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not everything. Like I don't know why we're standin' still.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closer with a teasing whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm supposed to be dizzy by now. Remember? From all those circles you danced around me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara leans against the bar. The knees are going again.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel like dancing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you do know how...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I be here if I didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Let's do it then. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He coaxes her onto the dance floor. PARLIAMENT'S funk classic "Flashlight" is playing. The dance crowd is robustly singing the refrain to the song. There's a party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each other. He's moving already. She starts to dance, stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now move your hips. Not so fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Sara looks lost)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara! Just like our hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing, in sync with the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The music's beginning to feel good to Sara. Patrick lets go of her hands. Starts to dance. Sara watches him intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into another less-complicated one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm. Her eyes never wander from his. And then she starts to feel something else. They both do. A rising beat. A quickening heart. And not from the dancing. She smiles bashfully at him. Patrick suddenly grabs her around the waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. All Sara can do is try to keep up and hang on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki avidly watching Sara and Patrick with Jasmin and Tiff'ny.
</DIRECTION>
<JASMIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's all up in your nut, Nikki... Oh, that's right. It ain't your nut anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASMIN>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is if I want it to be. He is if I want him to be. That bitch ain't got shit on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
The girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence. Nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is pricking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner. She licks his ear, whispers into it. Malakai laughs. Then his expression abruptly darkens. A storm cloud comes over it. He gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MALAKAI'S POV - WALKING TOWARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... two dealers a few feet away. They're talking to an Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as Malakai reaches the dealers. He doesn't explain, doesn't complain. He just starts swinging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA AND PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream! Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it instinctively. Looking around. In a small pocket of the club he sees Malakai.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK'S POV - MALAKAI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in full fisticuffs with the two dealers. Holding his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaving Sara, slicing through a clot of looky-loos until he reaches Malakai. He jumps into the fray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - FIGHT - PATRICK AND MALAKAI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thick crowd around them, proceed to beat the living shit out of the two dealers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SARA AND CHENILLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wrangling their way to the front line of the crowd, Diggy not far behind them. Sara looks on, dumbfounded and dazzled by what she sees, which is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pummeling his dealer into cowering submission. Only then does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping him with no signs of letting up. Patrick can see Malakai's too far gone for talk. He rushes him from behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FEETZ - OUTSIDE VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The exit door bursts open and Patrick and Malakai tumble out. Patrick bends over, cups his knees as he catches his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, what the hell are you doin'? Tryin' to get sent back up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They the ones tryin' shit. Comin' here. Squarin' off in my shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You couldn't let it slide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it slide tonight, they come back strong tomorrow. You know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Malakai, you fuck up parole, you ain't gonna back to JuVee. Eighteen and up, that's Jessup. Hardcore lockdown. You want that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
(regards him coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want what was mine. Feetz is my spot. I'ma do business here just like I did before. Like we did before. And if I gotta stomp some niggers in my way, so be it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
An uncertain but tense moment. Patrick tries to salvage it.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you definitely got the stompin' part down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. Share a small laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We fucked those fools up for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(crossing to exit door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For damn sure, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick finds the door locked. He and Malakai hoist themselves over a high, wrought iron fence. Disappear behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FEETZ - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distant WAIL of SIRENS as Feetz begins to empty out. Kids converge on the sidewalks. PICK UP Sara, Chenille and Diggy. Waiting and watching for Patrick. Diggy looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about to get real out here. Cops and shit. I'm gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves. Chenille spots Patrick. Not too worse for the wear. She smiles with relief. Then Sara sees him. She smiles too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara, Patrick and Chenille. Walking home. Chenille's preaching to Patrick. He's not in the mood.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Yeah, I'ma tell you. Tell you like I keep tellin' you, Patrick. You need to let Malakai alone. Let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chenille. I heard you the first five hundred times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
They round a corner bordering the Heights. Stop in front of it. Chenille, disconcerted with Patrick, looks dourly at Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you Monday.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Patrick, like an order)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll walk you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
As much as this makes sense, it still takes Patrick by surprise. Sara sees it in his face, regards Chenille with a false bravado.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a few blocks. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not okay. Would you tell the girl it ain't okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not okay, okay?

walking. Sara keeps stealing glances of him. Or so she thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(caught)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you keep lookin' at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not why. You wanna know somethin'. Ask somethin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was mad and he wasn't no kid. But you're from the suburb Mars, right? Folks don't fight there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(some kind of wonder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were really kicking his ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
It's not funny, the look on her face. But Patrick laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you laughing at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Dropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head. Looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend was in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She likes him. It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. But Malakai's good people. We go back. Way back. You know, like they say, through thick and thin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how'd you like Feetz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you got used to the music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile. His stare is significant, unsettling. Sara's face flushes. She turns from him, hoping he didn't see it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not all the time. But a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara snaps out of it. Looks around. Shit. First the flush and now this. She looks at him. She could kick herself.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We passed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You passed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
A look. They double back to her front door. Pause on the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for walking me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. I'll see ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again? Or is it like 'see ya,' I'll bust a cap in your ass if you ever darken my doorstep again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He makes it impossible not to smile. So damned charming.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time... okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

She enters the rowhouse. Patrick waits until the lights go on inside before he turns around and starts home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy's making breakfast when Sara straggles in. She peers at the stove. Scrambled eggs and bacon. Toast too! A first for him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figured I'd put a little marrow in your bones. Siddown, siddown.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she slumps in chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gettin' along at school? Makin' friends...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she nods robotically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... See any of 'em last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
He slides a plate in front of her. Stands there holding his.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came home on my break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The succinct sneer in her voice gets to Roy. He snaps at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Oh? Jesus! You're hard! Look. You're seventeen. If you wanna go out, go out. But don't lie to me. On top of everything else, don't make me worry like that about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after long moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to yell.

<DIRECTION>
(sits down; trying like hell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how are the eggs? They good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara takes a small, tasteless sample, nods. They eat in silence. Then Sara looks over at him with genuine if detached remorse.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. I should've said something. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Roy exhales. Finally, a chink in the brick wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you gonna do today? Anything special?

</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Nothing special.

INT. RECORD STORE (EAST POINT MALL) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A track from TOP DOGG BLARES from invisible SPEAKERS. All of the store's many customers are teenage kids. Snookie, in sunglasses and a reversed baseball cap, clerks behind the counter. He's ringing up (and trying to rap to) a fly girl when Patrick walks in, overhears the overture.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... How you know I can't do nothin' for you? I'm the hardest workin' man in showbizness, girl. C'mon. Let me be the bomb in your shell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
The fly girl rolls her eyes. Takes her bag. Leaves. Patrick looks at Snookie, wryly shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do the shit to yourself, man. The bomb in your shell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SNOOKIE>

	That was black magic, Patrick. It's gonna work one of these days.

He reaches behind the counter, hands Patrick a Jay-Z C.D.

	Last one on the rack. I snatched it up for you. Rang it up on my discount.

As he says this, his eyes wander around the store. And he sees her in the stacks. Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECORD STORE - HIP-HOP SECTION - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara with a bunch of C.D.'s. She juggles them in one hand, flips through Hip-Hop C.D.'s with another. She looks up to see Patrick standing beside her. He takes in the C.D.'s. Grins at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throwin' a party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
There's no wiggle room but Sara wiggles anyway.

	Well, you were fly anyway. Last night. Dancin', I mean.

<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(dead-serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick laughs. Looks at her. Sara looks back at him. They're staring at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we could hook up later. After school or somethin'. Work on some of your moves. If you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Sure.

Patrick nods affirmatively. Starts to leave. Turns back, indicates her stack of C.D.'s.

	By the way, Hammer's pretty much played out.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fight. Two black girls having at it. It's a ferocious match. Hair pulling, spit flying, punches landed, clothes torn apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she crowns the corner, comes to a bottleneck of students. It's like the nose bleed section of Caesar's Palace. The far hallway is the ring. Sara cranes her neck to see the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WIDENS as a security guard earns his hazard pay. He separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other. He throws one into a corner, hurls the other in an opposite corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a WHITE GIRL standing next to her shakes her head lamentably.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The White Girl studies Sara's suburban clothes and fresh- scrubbed face. Thinks she found a kindred spirit.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Toni. I was gonna introduce myself before but you're always with that crowd. You know. Chenille, her girls, that identity crisis Diggy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks at Toni. Getting it. Getting her. The expression on her face closes off. Toni, too dense to read it, keeps talking.
</DIRECTION>
<TONI>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should hang out sometime, Sara. The two of us. Whenever you decide to lose the tan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONI>
<DIRECTION>
Her inference clear, Toni flashes a brilliant smile, happily walks off. Sara shakes her head to herself. What an idiot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sara continues down the hall, a P.A. address comes on.
</DIRECTION>
<P_A_ADDRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seniors, a reminder before you rise up and change the world. Mrs. Gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office. Her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career D-Day. Be there.

Sara walks up the street (passing many black people), sees Roys' pickup. Shit. He's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of stairs to their apartment. There's a JAZZ INSTRUMENTAL FAINTLY coming from it. And another NOISE. Foreign and yet familiar. Like grunting... but not. Sara unlocks the door. Opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA'S POV - LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her father's fucking somebody! On the couch. Half on it anyway. In broad daylight! The whore underneath him is moaning. Jesus!

ANGLE WIDENS as Sara turns away from the spectacle. Reaches for Roy's sax. She blows the longest, shrillest note known to mankind.

<DIRECTION>
The hair on his head stands up. His body deflates instantly.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Sara sits at the table. Roy enters in a wrinkled T-shirt and battered jeans. His embarrassment is naked.

<DIRECTION>
The "whore" with the Hich C is RHONDA. She stands between the living area and the kitchen entrance now. Sara tries not to look at her. Can't help it. She has to see the whore. Not bad looking, in a washed out, bottle blonde barfly kind of way.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>

	Don't be mad at him. It's my fault. I'm real sorry, honey.

<DIRECTION>
OPEN CLOSE ON a framed photo of Glynn and Sara (in full ballet costume). Embracing. Happy. PULL BACK to see Sara. Sitting on the edge of her futon, holding Glynn's clover leaf necklace and staring at her mother's face. Lost. Lonely. Missing her. She kisses the lucky charm, smiles at Glynn, slips the necklace on.

INT./EXT. CAR WASH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick, in coveralls, slouches over a mechanic's station studying. A few workers mill about, waiting for the next car on a slow day. A BMW with tinted windows peels into the lot on two wheels. Patrick looks up as Malakai and a tall, wiry, nattily dressed man get out.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it.

<TUTE>

Malakai lets out a nervous laugh. Tute doesn't crack a smile.

<TUTE>

Tute emerges from cashier's office lighting a cigarette from a fresh pack. He blows a plume of smoke into the air, regards Patrick.

Patrick, still in work coveralls, enters. First thing he does is pick up a stack of mail. Tracking him into kitchen as he crosses to refrigerator, takes out a plate Momma Dean's left for him. He sits down at the table, takes a breath, begins shifting through the mail. His face registers disappointment. Nothing. Again.

	Maybe you think it's enough to have the grades, get a full scholarship. But it isn't, Patrick. Georgetown makes mulch of students like you every semester. You have to be ready to change.

EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS - ROOFTOP - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low sun over the cityscape of Baltimore. PUSH IN ON Patrick and Sara, two dots that grow larger. He CLICKS ON a BOOM-BOX resting on the roof's ledge. A hip-hop track BLASTS.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel the groove. Don't let the music mess with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to move with the music. Sara tries to emulate him. They dance throughout the conversation.

<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you. I'm brilliant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
He goes into a spin, a half-split, comes out of it swaggering and half-stepping around her. Sara gives him an impish look. Rises up on full pointe, turns out her legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his head. It happens in two blinks. So fast Patrick thinks it was a mirage. He stares at her, dumbfounded. Sara smiles. The look on his face is worth the pain in her joints. She blows some stray hair out of her face, puts her hands on her hips. Looks appropriately hapless.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't get it. That thing you just did. Show me again?
	</DIALOGUE>

She sounds suddenly defensive. Patrick's suddenly intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I don't want to talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you brought it up. Did that whole relieve thing. 'Cause you don't wanna talk about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's not a big deal. Can we just concentrate on this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we can concentrate.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; goading her a little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I think it is a big deal. Whatever it is you don't wanna talk about.

Sara shakes her head adamantly. He nods his head emphatically. Another stalemate. They dance coyly, seductively around it.

INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GIRLS' LAVATORY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dripping, out-of-order faucets, graffiti-laced stalls, litter-strewn floors are underscored by the spooky flicker of fluorescent lights. Sara walks in. The bathroom appears to be empty. She's about to enter a stall when she hears the murmur of a voice. A guy's voice. Then a girl's whimper. She eases forward a bit.

Sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the stall's open door. She cranes her neck trying to see without being sen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV - STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL is seated on the toilet. A man straddles her, his crotch in her face. The Girl sees Sara. Something in her face gives this away. The "man" glances out past his shoulder. He looks right down our throat straight into Sara's eyes. Malakai.
</DIRECTION>

ON SARA
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>

Malakai backs up. The Girl jumps up, runs out the lavatory. Malakai zips up his pants. Sara's frozen, staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. Not unless you want a taste for yourself. And that can be arranged.

</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Sara waits a moment. Exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees Mr. Hill, starts to move for him. Someone grabs her arm from behind. She turns, startled, a little afraid. It's the Girl from the stall. She looks Sara in the eye. Shakes her head. Don't. Mr. Hill walks by them unbeckoned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INNER HARBOR (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A perfect day. CAMERA PANS FROM the waterfront TO the bustling crowds of the inner harbor, then to a park across from this where Sara and Patrick are practicing. HIP-HOP MUSIC softly PLAYS from Patrick's BOOM-BOX. Sara watches his face as they dance.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you like it when you 'used' to dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means you owe him something?

He looks at her and she doesn't have the heart -- or the nerve -- to tell him. A long moment. She plucks a dandelion from the grass, twirls it thoughtfully in her fingers.

<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So she meant something to you. How come you never talk about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(studying her face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know why there's nothing to say? Because you don't talk about her. You won't talk about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry she's dead. God! What do you want me to do? Run through the streets screaming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? If it helps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(tersely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it won't. So drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you call Malakai scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. Patrick grins. Sara knocks her legs against his. He knocks his legs back. A silly moment. But it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Momma Dean's fixing dinner. Patrick enters with the mail in his teeth, a load of books in his arms. He dumps the books on the counter, busses Momma Dean's check on the way to the 'fridge.
</DIRECTION>
<MOMMA_DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're not puttin' those dirty hands inside my refrigerator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOMMA_DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick backs up to the sink. Washes his hands. Impishly dries them on her apron. He sits, begins sifting through the mail. Momma Dean pulls an envelope from her pocket. Waves it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOMMA_DEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This what you're lookin' for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOMMA_DEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille appears in the doorway. Patrick takes the letter. He's almost afraid to open it. But he does. And as he reads the letter, a slyly relieved smile spreads across his face. He tosses the letter in the air. Grabs Chenille and Momma Dean. And the three of them jump up and down together with joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressed to the nines. They look happy and relaxed, more so than we've ever seen. They sit close to each other. Very close.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna tell me where we're going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he grins, shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is the surprise for me? You're the one with something to celebrate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can celebrate together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. Can't find any words. So she just goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box. She hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be received.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to get you something and I couldn't figure out what. It's not much but I hope you like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick opens the box. Removes a key chain. It's engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.). He regards her, touched.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it. I love it. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. There's more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. The back side of it is engraved with the words, "PATRICK REYNOLDS, M.D." Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her hand to his lips. Kisses it softly. The gesture is succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're the only two people in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CITY BUS - SARA AND PATRICK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on. Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even closer to each other. Patrick's arm is around Sara's shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds one of her legs between his and whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have an audience. Work with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(nonplussed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto voce, through her teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her ass -- what else is there? -- runs his hand along her side. The white woman, thoroughly disgusted, gets up and moves to the back of the bus. Patrick and Sara look at each other, burst out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALTIMORE HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The equivalent of D.C.'s Kennedy Center, the hall is awash in lights and activity. Men and women are donned in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner -- "Boston Ballet, A Command Performance." Sara's heart stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She looks positively catatonic.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprise... Sara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly urgent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I can't go in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(doesn't understand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to go in. This is where I'm bringing you. The ballet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(beside herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(crestfallen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks at him, feeling bad. Feeling stupid for ruining the evening. She bites her lip, shakes her head ("but nothing"). Patrick takes her and they go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALTIMORE HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Patrick watch the Boston Company perform Igor Stravinsky's "Scenes De Ballet" as choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon. They're both enraptured. But while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara, her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. She is utterly, totally engaged and amazed. The yearning that never really left her returns to tug at her heart and project her soul onto the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Post-ballet, Sara and Patrick walk. She's quiet, introspective. Patrick's at a loss. He can't decipher her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you would like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't actin' like you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks over at him, tries to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a small, secluded bridge. Sara sits down on the edge of it. Patrick follows suit. A long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(without rancor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg trick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
A long, difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find the words, face the pain that comes with them. Finally, she looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I don't want it to be real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of it. It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil she's feeling. But she goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(because)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was raining...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a torrent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked with tears and guilt. Patrick puts his arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(inconsolable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your fault it rained or she died. Or that you danced. That's what you were there for. Your mom would've expected you to do what you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what makes it so bad. She always did what was right for me. I wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be. Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. I didn't care. It was my stupid dream and it killed her. All she wanted was for it to come true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, Sara. She wouldn't want you to give up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know... but she... I just don't think I can do it without her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(holding her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to do it, Sara? I mean you. Do you want Juilliard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's on you to make the dream come true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. For my mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For her. For you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT/STREET - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick walks Sara to the front door. They pause on the stoop. Neither of them wants the night to end.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
A rhetorical question under the circumstances. Patrick regards her tenderly, moves her hair from her eyes. Stares deeply into them. Sara smiles wanly, certain she looks like shit. But it doesn't matter. The moment has named itself. And so, with more certainty than passion, they kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS the room, PICKING UP small touches from Sara's past life, her previous bedroom -- more on display than we've seen before. HOLD ON closet door. A beat before Sara emerges from behind it, ballet slippers in hand. She takes a deep breath. Slides them on. Peers down at her feet. Wiggles them. Nothing magical or mystical but simply wonderful. Gleefully wonderful. Like the end of a long day's journey to home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INNER HARBOR COMPLEX (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Patrick negotiate the heavy pedestrian traffic, exit the complex. He leads her to a mall of trees and bike paths.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme see that move you did. That cute leg relieve thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(hates to admit this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hurts! I'm out of shape and it hurts. Okay? Satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(admiring her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Practice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get in shape like that. But it's still a good spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(diffidently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got my application for Juilliard. Just in time too. They're holding auditions in Baltimore next month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, shakes her head. Not that great.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never be ready in a month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara, you puttin' the mojo on yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(a smile in spite of herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mojo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand. Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. I used to practice two, three hours every day. I'm so far behind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
... And unsure and afraid. Which Patrick can sense. But he won't let her go there or stay there. He's firm, matter-of-fact.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit whinin' and catch up then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not as easy as that. My free form still sucks. It's still the weakest part of my routine. That hasn't changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'll help you with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised that she's surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me what you need to do and let's get busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEGINS OVER THEME MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara in the mirror dressed in leotards and tights. She bends forward from the hip, extends a leg, a corresponding arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she tries to complete the arabesque, the backward-most leg buckles. She steadies herself. Starts over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA - IN VARIOUS STAGES OF GETTING BUSY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATTERSON FOOTBALL FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hip-hop hybrid with Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANCE STUDIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In class. Struggling to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On way to and from bus stop. Practicing as she walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANCE STUDIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone with her instructor. Looking good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANCE STUDIO - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone with her instructor. Looking better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROY'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soaking and tending her bleeding feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPEN CLOSE ON a black hand shaking a white one. PULL BACK to reveal Patrick and Roy. Sara enters looking striking, pretty, very down. Chenille's influence is written all over her makeup and her clothes. Overlooking Roy, she blithely tags Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's skip.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cursory, to Roy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They leave. Roy stands in the middle of the room, dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's 'skip'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three months and she's skipping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Usual suspects, usual music. Patrick hands Sara a call- brand beer. Leans in with his drink, openly and contently with her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki and her crew (Jasmin, Tiff'nee, Alyssa). Nikki hasn't seen Patrick and Sara. She's showing her crew a dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille, Diggy and another black girl. Fraternizing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - DEEJAY BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chrome-domed deejay with a Barry White baritone bellows into his mike as he changes the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DEEJAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master P with the 'Ghetto D'. Showmesomethin', showmesomethin', give up that cruel. Eyes on you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEEJAY>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER as the dance floor swells with kids. PICK UP Sara and Patrick among them. She looks at him nervously. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's watchin' you but me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
A gallant lie. Sara tries to believe it. They dance. Practice has made her near perfect. Their movements are ambitious, nimble, better than anyone else on the floor. They move so well together that Snookie, dancing nearby, starts chanting:
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE OF DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diggy. Jiggling and wildly gyrating. Chiming in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, Sara! Go, Sara!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIGGY>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK AND SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
building up a sweat; confidently dancing at fever pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DEEJAY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody have funk, funk, funk!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEEJAY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - DANCE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Patrick, still going at it. Snookie, Diggy and others prance around them like backup dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIKKI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing with her crew dourly observing Patrick and Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch me squash their shit. Hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
ON NIKKI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoving, pushing, and barging her way up to Patrick. Without preamble or regard for Sara, she starts dancing with him. Patrick looks at Sara but he's somehow dancing with Nikki. Sara retreats with daggers in her eyes. Pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK (AND NIKKI)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
unresponsive as she grinds her body into his, raw and wild.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing where she can see but can't be seen from the dance floor. From a curtain of kids, Malakai suddenly appears at her side. Sara can't move. She's boxed in. Malakai indicates Nikki and Patrick with slick satisfaction, whispers derisively:
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't never gonna look as good as she does with him. That's oil. You're milk. Ain't no point in tryin' to mix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
He evaporates into the crowd. Sara stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATRICK AND NIKKI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a SLOW DANCE BEGINS. Nikki starts to press herself against Patrick. Patrick holds her off with both arms. Walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR - FAVOR PATRICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving toward Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stark, apologetic expression on his face. He takes her hand. Sara fiercely jerks away. Patrick grabs her hand again, more emphatically this time. But Sara won't budge from the spot where she's standing. So Patrick slides his arms around her, holds her without moving. They remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly begin to dance. We PUSH IN ON them in this little space. Patrick's lips brush Sara's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST THEM ON MALAKAI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slow dancing with his flavor of the night. Eyes on Sara and Patrick. Both underwhelmed and resentful of what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - HALLWAY/FRONT DOOR - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara unlocks the door. She and Patrick enter. She turns on the lights. Looks at him. Answers the unspoken question.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in D.C. Blues Alley. He'll be gone all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick sits down on the sofa. Sara crosses to the STEREO, turns it ON. A SAX SOLO begins playing.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roy's demo. The only one he ever cut. Kinda grows on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Somewhere between five seconds and forever. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna see my room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick looks at her, nods. He gets up, follows Sara behind the partition into her "room." They stand there for a moment. He cups her face with his hands. Kisses her. They begin to take off each other's clothes, alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit urgent. Sara unzips Patrick's pants, catches something other than his clothes. Patrick winces in pain. She looks at him with an embarrassed grimace. Says this very low.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again, stumble backward to her futon. Fall down upon it and begin to make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - PATRICK AND SARA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS them as they walk down the hall hand-in- hand, sometimes exchanging greetings with other students. They are officially a couple and they appear to be in love. At the door to Sara's next class, Patrick busses her lips before she enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No teacher is present. The class files in. Toni drops down in a chair beside Sara. She leans over in a conspiratorial whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<TONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you do, don't fuck him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONI>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<TONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Hit it and quit it,' that's their motto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONI>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose motto?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<TONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Black guys. Everybody knows that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONI>
<DIRECTION>
The teacher walks in. Sara quickly whispers back to Toni.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget, they all have big dicks and beat their wives. Everybody knows that too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RIB JOINT (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malakai, along with Snookie and two brain donors, ARVEL and LIP, eat at a booth. Patrick strolls in gritty from work. Tired from work. He slides in next to Malakai. The mood is light, jovial.
</DIRECTION>
<ARVEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You smell, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARVEL>

	You tappin' that white girl, man?

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you ain't got time for your boyz no more, you too busy frontin'. Too busy snowflakin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>

Patrick lifts one of Malakai's ribs, responds coolly.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>

Patrick grabs some of Arvel's fries, chews them in his face.

<PATRICK>

</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>

</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't pressed. I got my own shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Shorthand. The table stops. Malakai glances around, lifts his shirt to expose a gun. Patrick stares at Malakai with disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you think? I'ma keep walkin' around waitin' for some chump to cap me? I'ma protect myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ain't protection. It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it. Shit. Mayhem and madness. That's a black man's life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you know? You ain't tried nothing else. Now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason. You askin' for trouble, Malakai.

<DIRECTION>
(as Malakai laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this shit's funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Snookie shifts uncomfortably. Arvel and Lip look at Malakai. Malakai looks at Patrick, coldly drops his smile.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's funny you think it ain't necessary. You act like you don't know where you are no more, Patrick, and whassup out there for anybody who ain't you. Maybe that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<LIP>

INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Patrick, post-coital. She's in her robe. He's dressed but they're fooling around as they fix sandwiches. Patrick drops down in a chair. Sara drops down on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your favorite flower?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have a favorite.

</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but if you did...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. Maybe cymbidiums -- orchids. They're sort of show- boaty but they're pretty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your favorite color?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>

	Mmm. Mauve.

</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're makin' this real hard, Sara. Those ain't exactly tuxedo colors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara swings her legs around, facing him, straddling him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nut. What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was tryin' to get around to askin' you somethin' but since I'm some sorta nut, you probably wouldn't wanna go to prom with me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She throws her arms around his neck, kissing him. Patrick slides his hands under her robe, cups her breasts. Sara responds to him. They are too engrossed in this intimacy to hear the FRONT DOOR OPENING, to see Roy until he walks in and sees them. Sara leaps up, closes her robe. Patrick doesn't know what to do. He's caught. Straight up. Red-handed. Roy's eyes dart between them, settle on and slice into Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick -- it is Patrick, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a small awkward nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think you were just leavin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick stands up. Sara grabs his arm defiantly, holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does he have to leave? We're all adults. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He either leaves or I throw his ass out. Your call, Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick jerks his arm free from Sara, grabs his jacket off the back of his chair. He back-talks Roy as he passes him.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chill, man. I'm goin'. You don't have to come off with all 'at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the hell are you to tell me how to come off? You're in my house alone with my daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
It takes everything Patrick has to keep walking until he's out the door. It slams behind him. Sara marches up to Roy, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate being your daughter. You ruin everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to stomp off. Roy kicks a chair in her path. Snarls.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Siddown.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(not a request; an order; as she sits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a free country, you can hate me. Ain't like that's exactly news. But disrespectin' me, that's where the road ends, Sara. I don't want him up here again. I mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean it because he's black.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't start that bullshit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why's it bullshit? Because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for Angela Bassett?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep telling yourself that. Just don't expect me to believe it. I saw how you looked at him. But you didn't see him. Well, for your information, he's a straight- A student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, Sara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Not quite the truth, but near enough to sting. It quiets Roy down. He regards her with regret and guilt.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like you have it all figured out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years!

Now she does storm off. This time Roy lets her. He can't find the words to deny what she's said.

EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - QUAD OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY

A break between classes draws the requisite claques and cliques. Sara and Patrick huddle over a chemistry book, attentive to each other. Nikki stands off watching both of them. Malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint. Hazily indicates Patrick and Sara.

He regards her with bemused pity. Nikki, with all her inner outrage, manages to salvage her pride. She sneers in his face.

A girls' basketball game in progress. Sara's playing defense. She's on Nikki's team. She blocks a shot but Chenille, on the opposing team, gets it on the rebound. Basket. Nikki shoots Sara a murderous look. Stupid, uncoordinated bitch.

A four-on-four game in progress. Patrick, Malakai, Snookie and Arvel versus the Druid Hill Two Deuces. An unseen BOOM BOX BLASTS the music of JAY-Z throughout. Patrick has the ball.

Sara takes her defensive position against an opposing player, successfully blocks the shot, tries to slam the ball to Nikki. It clips Nikki's head, bounces out of bounds. Nikki, her dignity stunned, her patience out, walks up to Sara, shoves her to the floor. Sara looks up at her as some disembodied voice calls out:

INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM

A car speeds off. Patrick raises up, looks around. Malakai nods. He's okay. Snookie's crawling to the exit, snot-nosed and crying. He's okay. Then they see Arvel. Sprawled on the ground. Covered in blood. He seems lifeless.

	Somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in Sara's face, start all this drama. What you tryin' to prove, Nikki?

	I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on her heels, goes back to her machine. Patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. He holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out.

INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - CHENILLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille and Kenny. In the middle of a contentious moment. He tries to give her some money. She snatches it out of his hand. Kenny looks at her. He's hurt. Chenille's too mad to see it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? I'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's more than a dollar. And it's all I got.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got laid off rom B.W.I., Chenille. I been workin' part- time. Money's tight. You know how you are about money. That's way I haven't been coming around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille stares at him for a long moment. Her voice is low.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't have no feelings when it comes to me. All you do is bitch and complain about what I don't do. I get sick of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be sick of it. You ain't got to see me to see your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be sure to keep that in mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Chenille stands there, mad at him. Mad at herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREE CLINIC (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lowest common denominator for misery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is filled with young women, most them black, and children of all ages. They are piled up like cars on a freeway, waiting to be seen. The noise level is at a peak when Chenille and Sara walk in. Chenille's carrying a fussy Christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack. Sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for Christopher.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to take him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille shakes her head. Walks to reception to sign herself in. Sara takes in the faces of girls younger than herself, the grime and gloom of the room. It's incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children are brought to get well. Chenille finishes at the desk. Returns to Sara. They cross to a corner of the clinic where they sit -- on the floor. Chenille indicates the receptionist bitterly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wench. You gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list. Triflin' bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille starts to change Christopher's diaper. He starts to wail and flail. Chenille can't placate him. One of his kicks connects with Chenille's open backpack, sends books and papers flying. Sara can see the veins stand up on Chenille's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She does. Chenille's finally got control of Christopher but he's still crying. Chenille slips off his dirty diaper. When Sara hands her a clean one, Chenille regards her strangely, as if just remembering that she's there.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your old man flipped about the fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with some animus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably thinks it's all Patrick's fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I explained about Nikki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. You put it all on her. None of it's on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She started it, Chenille. She wanted to start it. I told you what she said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille flashes a look, finishes up with Christopher. She picks him up, puts a bottle in his mouth. Cradles him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. But she had a reason to say what she said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
A reason? Sara studies her, trying to fathom the remark.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you agree with her? You think I don't belong with Patrick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I think don't matter. But you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together. Like it don't hurt people to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(her Irish up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We like each other. What is the big fucking deal? It's him and me. Not us and other 'people.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The white girl with the rose-colored reasoning. Chenille glares at Sara, her voice designed to snatch the blinders off.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Black people, Sara. Black women.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(passionately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick's about somethin'. He's smart. He's motivated. He's for real. He ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life. He's gonna do somethin' with himself. Here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive-bys. That's what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara sits there, stupefied. Understanding. Not understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one world, Chenille.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were friends. Guess I was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up, walks out. Something in Chenille wants to call after her, but she's too miserable, too torn up inside to do it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FEETZ - BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick and Malakai nurse drinks. The MUSIC fails to move them. They have too much on their minds. Malakai fires up a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what you gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times you gonna ask me that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's payback time. Either you down or you ain't. Either you m'boy or you not. Simple as that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick takes a long moment. The choice is simple. It's the decision that's complicated. He downs his drink. Hedges.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eastside ain't got no firepower. I got some shit, man. AK-47. We go in, get out with one spray down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Snookie and Sara walk toward them from the dance floor. Something in their faces unsettles Sara but Snookie, oblivious, dances up to the bar, snapping his fingers and bobbing his head.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see us, Patrick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
(a storm warning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see us, man? We're rappin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Snookie rebuffs him, keeps talking to Patrick...
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and Sara lit it up! Y-e-o-w!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
... bumps his butt against Sarah's hip, does a very ungainly half split. Sara and Patrick exchange smiles. Malakai isn't amused. He flattens Snookie's ass with the business end of his foot. Snookie sprawls flat on his face to the floor. Now Malakai's amused. Sara looks at Patrick. Patrick scowls at Malakai.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That shit ain't funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(springing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn right it ain't funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you liked it down there. That's your specialty, ain't it? Crawling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a reflex action, man. And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she doesn't want the displeasure of Malakai's company. She taps Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta get home. Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Malakai's eyes slice into her. First Snookie, now this bitch. Steppin' all over his conversation with Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he ain't ready. He's talkin'. To me. A-B conversation. Gotta go? C yourself the fuck home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(a real reflex action)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Malakai lunges for her. The move is so swift and sudden Patrick overturns his stool to dive between them. He sweeps Sara behind him, into the path of a startled
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snookie. Stands there nose-to-nose with Malakai, staring him down, furious with him.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do. Snookie's voice weakly creaks out. He's trying to rise to the occasion.
</DIRECTION>
<SNOOKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick, man, c'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNOOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
But Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand. Too close for comfort. Both in the danger zone. Malakai regards Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep, genuine hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause you wrong, Malakai!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You wrong. You BEEN wrong. You ain't worth shit no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(venomously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out my face, and take that ho with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick bucks up. Sara walks over to him, gently clutches his sleeve. It's no easier to turn away from Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship. But Patrick does. With Sara holding onto his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking. A heavy silence. Sara looks over at him. Patrick doesn't say anything. But after a moment, he reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like this together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER MUSIC (e.g. BUSTA RHYMES' "Dangerous.")
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANCE STUDIO - SARA AND PATRICK - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Practice her free form, a hip-hop ballet hybrid. They're both tired, irritable, beaten down. They've been there awhile. Sara makes a misstep. Patrick stops. Cold. Sara grits on him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should keep going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You messed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She glares at him, exasperated. So many things bottled up.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't work like this. I can't dance like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like this. You dictating to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses the room, CUTS OFF the MUSIC. Looks at her. Sara walks over to a window seat near him. Flops down.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong, Sara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing's wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(except)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't figure things out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know there was a 'them.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he's so nonplussed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's screwed up. Nobody wants to see us together, not even Chenille. I don't know why they feel that way. How can I know? Maybe they have a point, Patrick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They only got a point if you believe they got a point, Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him... and loves him... and doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a fuckin' 'nough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you getting mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I like to think for myself, run my own life, and I thought you did too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks at him. Now she's getting mad.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She's crossed the line. But Patrick responds so deliberately, so calmly prosaic, that she doesn't immediately realize it...
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over. Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through. Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. So don't come off to me like you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
... until he erupts.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are you to say he's lost? Malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They weren't rednecks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick yanks his boombox off the floor, glares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? The hell with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara yells after him. Her VOICE ECHOES in the empty studio.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell with you too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY OUTSIDE SARA'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. Like shit. She walks a few paces. Sees Patrick. Their eyes connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on their respective ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATTERSON HIGH - SARA'S LOCKER/HALLWAY - LATER THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's at her locker. Patrick walks up to her. She looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick doesn't say anything at first. But then:
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you might need this on Saturday. I ain't gonna be able to make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her an audio cassette of her free form music. Sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this means. She won't let him see how it shatters her. He hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. But Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - TONI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaching Sara's locker. Having seen the encounter between Patrick and Sara, she's as smug and overbearing as ever.
</DIRECTION>
<TONI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lovers' quarrel? You're better off. That menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash. Trust me on that, Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONI>
<DIRECTION>
Sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. She resists the urge to slap the smile off Toni's face. She gets in it instead.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toni, listen carefully. You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She storms off leaving Toni, for once, speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY/CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara. Caught up in a throng of kids and somehow very separate from them. The walls have been transformed into veritable billboards for the senior prom -- decorations are everywhere. Sara continues down the hallway almost aimlessly into the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara. Carrying a food tray, eyes searching for a place to sit. She picks up Chenille and her girls at one table... Nikki and her crew at another... Patrick and Snookie... and, finally, Toni. Sara dumps her food into a trash can, walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara. Alone. She pushes the tape from Patrick into an ancient recorder. The MUSIC COMES ON. She takes to the floor. Her face is like a pinched nerve. She wants to cry. She tries to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album. Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition. Waits a beat before he comes in. He looks at Sara. She keeps flipping.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(this raises a small smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara regards him quizzically. Roy goes to her dresser, picks up an envelope from Juilliard.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly miserable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She's clutching the photo album. Roy sits down next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow's the big day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. The big day.

</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bummed out about it?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a worse liar than I am father.

</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(close to a confession)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's eyes well up. Before she can stop herself, she's crying.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Roy takes her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	in his arms, tries
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
to console her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara draws back from Roy, wipes her tears. Collects herself.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want him there. I understand that. But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara. You're the bottom line out there. This is your chance to be the dancer Juilliard came to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted somebody there who loves me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony implicit.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks up. For the first time in her life, she believes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. WAITING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father, stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her. Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him. They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why his mom's cryin' like that? Arvel's gonna make it, right? That what's his nurse said. She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it.' Did that bitch lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick! Is he gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds him there.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to be strong; faltering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body, cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this crooked, derisive way.
</DIRECTION>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a good reason now, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Patrick's silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw'ight, college boy. You do what you think is the right thing. I'ma do what I know is the only thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to walk off, doesn't get far before Patrick calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Malakai...

EXT. PLAYGROUND (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PARK) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groups of children scatter around worn-out playground equipment. The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere. Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine throughout their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you so quiet?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Patrick's brooding look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catches her son with a whee!; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(monotone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what you said, Chenille.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I lyin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sayin' you can't help who you love, Patrick. At least you found somebody who loves you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick regards Chenille impassively. Hands Christopher to her.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To where? To who? Malakai?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sucks her teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't through with that fool yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not a fool, Chenille.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You know what? You're the fool, Patrick. You think you let Malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up. Ain't no blame or shame in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(very low; a broken smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still gotta go. Check you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Christopher, Chenille watches Patrick walk out of the playground. Disappear. She and Christopher move on to a seesaw. Chenille bobs him up and down on one end of it. She's snuggling in Christopher's face when the other end suddenly drops to the ground. Chenille looks up. Sees Kenny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAYGROUND - SWINGS - CHENILLE AND KENNY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're side by side on swings. Christopher's nestled against Kenny's chest, soundly snoozing. They slowly swing throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It cut me, what you said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't have... I was trippin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always trip. I'm used to that. Besides, you were right. You were wrong, too. So was I. I need to do better. Ain't no doubt about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I come down on you hard about money, but I would rather you spend the time. Seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(jokingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't want any money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHENILLE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles. Gently rubs Christopher's brow. Looks at her. Chenille smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love my son, Chenille. You know that, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<CHENILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I always knew that.

The house lights are on. Several seats in the front row are taken up by judges for Juilliard. Further back are the families and friends of other dancers. PUSH IN and FAVOR Roy among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Warming up, other dancers, all in costume, around her. Her eyes wander from the clock to the stage door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign on it reads: "JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE - BALTIMORE AUDITIONS." She stares at it, fingers the clover leaf necklace with an unsettling sense of deja vu.

EXT. STREET (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick's waiting on the sidewalk. Malakai pulls up in Tute's BMW. Lip's in the backseat. Patrick gets into the car. It takes off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. STREET - BMW - DRIVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAP MUSIC blasts ON the RADIO. No one in the car is saying anything. Malakai has a "40" between his legs. He sips from it, passes it to Patrick. Patrick takes a short swig, passes it back to Lip. As he does this, a set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap. Patrick picks them up. Looks at the key chain, his present from Sara. He looks at Malakai.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Malakai glances at him, not understanding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai. I'm out. I mean it. Stop the car.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What you mean you out? You think I'ma let your punk ass bail on me again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick starts to open the door. Malakai speeds up. The CAR CAREENS down the street, SQUEALS around corners. Finally comes to a red light. Stops. Patrick starts to open the door. Malakai grabs him by the jacket. Pulls his gun. Patrick looks at Malakai and now he sees him. Sees that he's lost and desperate... and dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you gonna do, 'Kai? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll have to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<LIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him out! We don't need him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIP>
<MALAKAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALAKAI>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick jerks himself loose. Opens the door. Malakai cocks the gun. Patrick's face flinches at the sound of it. He can feel it trained on his back as he gets out the car. But Malakai can't do it. Wouldn't do it. He takes off like a bat out of hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick heads down the street. As he walks, he can hear the sound of GUNFIRE behind him, and then the sound like an EXPLOSION. A CAR HORN goes off in a persistent drone. Patrick stops. Stands there for a moment. Then he's walking again. Without looking back. And then he's running away from the mayhem behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BMW's tangled around a street lamp. Inside Malakai slumps over the steering wheel, a bullet through his head.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pince-Nez leads Sara to the stage. Announces her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara walks onstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience. Her eyes anxiously search for Patrick... hoping. Her MUSIC begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grieg's Peer Gynt (Morning). Sara starts to sway, moving like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. Her line, proportion and balance are impeccable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake (Tanz der Schwane) begins and Sara slowly blossoms, opening herself up to the music like a flower. She completes every turn and twist and leap with confidence, energy and persuasion. She is doing what a dancer should do -- engaging the audience, igniting their imagination, drawing them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

One of the more imperious-appearing JUDGES removes his glasses, speaks to her. Sara's still trying to catch her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<STERN_JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You prepared a free-form?

</STERN_JUDGE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... sir... they have... my music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it have a theme?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Emo...

<DIRECTION>
(clears her throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emotion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The Judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see:
</DIRECTION>
<STERN_JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cue Johnson's music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STERN_JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC UP: A remix of hip-hop (e.g., LAURYN'S HILL'S doo wop; NAS'S "We Will Survive" and JAY Z's latest) and snatches of CLASSICAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands there. Doesn't move. Can't. She finally walks up to the edge of the stage. Looks down at the judges, her eyes filled with trepidation. Her voice is a shaky whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I wasn't ready. Can you start it over again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
The Judge waving off the MUSIC. It STOPS. He regards Sara impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<STERN_JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STERN_JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can respond, Patrick's voice booms from the back of the auditorium.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. She's ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly take her in.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(because)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't nobody watchin' you but me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's eyes focus on him. She nods. Turns to the judges.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
As her MUSIC cues up, Patrick slowly backs away from the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara begins to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts out strong and gets stronger. Every emotion she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a way that we've never seen before, not even when she was practicing with Patrick. Her body has finally found a way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its meaning and transform her dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC ENDS. The lights go up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless, sweating. She lifts her head slowly and the ANGLE WIDENS to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patrick letting out a giant whoop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The judges react and the audience gasps...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as he bounds onto the stage and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy jumps to his feet. Proudly and loudly clapping. Just like Glynn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
overwhelmed beyond belief. Patrick's coming toward her. She flies into his arms, free and happy, overjoyed. But the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer, which is her love for Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggling to maintain their and the proceeding's decorum, since the audience, caught up in the throes of this excitement, has begun to loudly, enthusiastically react.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, please!

Patrick hugging Sara, looks down at the judges.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All due respect, if ya'll don't let this girl in, you're crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sara pulls Patrick back. Walks alone to the edge of the stage, composed and professional again. She regards the judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy, then simply says:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<STERN_JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Johnson!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STERN_JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara stops. Turns back to him. The Judge smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<STERN_JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't say this on the record -- yet. But welcome to Juilliard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STERN_JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
SARA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek-to-cheek smile. WIDER as she walks slowly, deliberately back to Patrick. Stops. Looks at him. Just looks. And then she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging him. Emotional. Patrick swings her into the air, twirls her around and around, as we:

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - SENIOR PROM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER SLOW MUSIC (possible theme song):
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara (in a gown) and Patrick (in a tux). Dancing (as if they had danced from the last FRAME INTO this one). They are beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER to reveal the entire dance floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see that it's the senior prom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room's dressed up like a dreamy, futuristic romantic illusion. The ceiling's ablaze with tiny, star-like lights; under them large poufs of cotton clouds hang. Glittering, mirrored balls dangle over the main floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seniors dance in traditional and cutting edge tuxes and mouth-watering, eye-popping versions of dresses and gowns. CAMERA PANS the floor, PICKING UP:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surprisingly dashing Snookie and the fly girl. As they dance, he bravely but rather too abruptly dips her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diggy (in a glitter tuxedo and spiked hair) and her date...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki with whom we shall perceive to be the Howard University guy. In any event, he looks slightly bored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chenille with Kenny, smiles at Sara as she and Patrick dance by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FAVORS and PUSHES IN ON...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Patrick. Gazing at each other. The SONG ENDS with them in each other's arms.

FADE OUT.
