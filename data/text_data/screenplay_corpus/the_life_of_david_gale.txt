EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs, and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin."

</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip.

EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty parking lot to Volvo station wagon.

As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance.

KRUGER (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric massager. A name plate on her desk reads "Barbara D.

Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.

</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't rightly know one fraternity from another. But if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute... You do that, Susan... Bye now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grover hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Margie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Bitsey and Zack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I presume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, hello.

<DIRECTION>
They shake hands.

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stemmons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again. I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community relations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach, his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(WOMAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's usually real good with names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGIE>
<GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bitsey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And these days I always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitsey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin' your umbrella.

	Okey dokey.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows, turns his collar up.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack smiles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On death row?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we house 422 inmates here. Average stay with us is nine years. Some get commuted, move on, most get killed. It'll put you off your supper, but then it's supposed to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard nods as they pass.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afternoon, Earl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got three concerns here: safety, safety and safety. The visitation area is entirely secure -- we just ask you don't touch the glass. Windex gets expensive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the door of the entrance area.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rules say seven days prior to execution inmates must be interviewed in a cage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR BUZZES, Grover opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLIS ENTRANCE LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines. To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal detector. They enter and make their way toward the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This changes for no man. You're not carryin' a weapon are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at the counter. Behind it are two GUARDS, one male, one female.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guards)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarence. Karla. New York guests for Mr. Gale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<CLARENCE>

(GUARD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I see your purse, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bitsey, indicating the metal detector)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on and walk through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
Grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and waits for her.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, should any kinda of unpleasantness occur in the visitation area, we ask that you stay put. Come on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please follow the instructions of these fine correctional officers should they see fit to give you any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing her the purse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
He leads them down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anythin' you say can be overheard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
And any discussion of criminal activity on your part is admissible. Not plannin' a jailbreak are you, Bitsey?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the door for them.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.
</DIRECTION>
<GROVER>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out to Belyeu)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All yours, Mr. Belyeu.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bitsey and Zack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You folks have safe visit now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GROVER>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard Yard.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Bloom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stands up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did that P.R. man validate your parkin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said the gift shop could do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Belyeu laughs, smiles pure Old New Orleans charm.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
(to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a smart one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Zack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is the man of the hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really loudly) interrupts:
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Gale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
All wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, why can't they turn that thing down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(to the microphone above him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're practicing being cruel and unusual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two-hour sessions. Today, tomorrow and Thursday, all at three in the P.M. I'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. Furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have my Gregg book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need it for Billy's appeal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bitsey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes out his planner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I have some papers for which I need your Jo Ann Hancock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(handing her a business card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come by my Austin office at your earliest convenience. Thursday mornin', say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up at the microphone. She understands, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, till Thursday then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, Miss Bloom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come by later. We can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
David waves "get lost." Belyeu turns.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye, ya' all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELYEU>
<DIRECTION>
They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking at the floor, caught in a thought.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Have a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. We called it playing 'Execution.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since I grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your ex-wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We agreed minimal contact would be easier. Please don't mention her, or my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' I'll take it to my grave. But then you know that about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
David smiles, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the pen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this recording equipment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should we start?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the magazine, the format. You chose me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go.
	</DIALOGUE>

David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile.

INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David lecture. He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad student himself. On the white board behind him are phrases: "Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory."
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think. What do you fantasize about? World peace?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as no one responds)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought so.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd laughs, David changes tone.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, good, you see Lucan's point. Fantasies must be unrealistic. The minute you get something, you don't, you can't, want it anymore. To exist, desire needs absent objects. So desire supports itself with crazy fantasies...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs at the timing. David pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<STUDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she moves towards them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what Pascal means when he says the only time we're truly happy is when day-dreaming about future happiness.

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
A guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office. It's from a girl friend two rows back. The girlfriend mouths, "It came today?"
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not because you'll get it, but because you're doomed not to want it if you do. Think about it next time you're at a wedding.

Laughter. The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the letter in a book.
</DIRECTION>

Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him against the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes).

EXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, far better than what a university professor can afford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway, his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front sits a new VW Beetle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer & Curious Person." The room is over-decorated with boy stuff.

INSERT - KID'S CALENDAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it. Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley face in an adult's.

David puts the jeans and shoes away.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only three. That's great, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he doing in here?

</DAVID>
<CHASE>

Chase reaches under the sheets, searches, finally pulls out a laser pointer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
He "shoots" some toys in the corner with the red laser dot.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough fabrics. The art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner. A few African antiquities are scattered throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BABYSITTER sits on the couch reading a school textbook, holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads. David passes on his way to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back before midnight.

He exits. When she hears the DOOR CLOSE, the Babysitter reaches for the TV remote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUPLEX - LIVING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The duplex is upscale, two-story with a vaulted ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scattered about are forty party-goers, mostly grad students. Some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool. Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic," "Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know," "[Philosophic t-shirt]".) LEONARD COHEN MUSIC PLAYS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREER (late 20s, Persian, "Host" t-shirt) escorts David into the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<GREER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the N.F.L. Consistent, accurate, effective, and boring, boring, boring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREER>
<DIRECTION>
Greer leaves him at the sofa where an OLDER PROFESSOR (60s, homemade t-shirt -- "Pre-Socratic" -- over his shirt and tie) stands speaking with ROSS (late 40s, "Homosexualist" t- shirt).

</OLDER_PROFESSOR>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the patio. They watch him go.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like Sharon's affair is an open secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hermeneutical bias: the only fun truths are the ones someone's trying to hide.

	Have a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
They sit on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid. Probations suspended her. She received the letter today, took the opportunity to throw a fit in my office. You should --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talking about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She's standing behind them. David tilts his head back.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
She's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to David)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He tell you I said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He mentioned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
An uncomfortable beat. She reaches over and takes Ross's drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called schmuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. I think it's called schmuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't we so fucking clever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(standing, escaping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I should get us another. David?

</ROSS>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Black Bush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Ross walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads "Sex is Power."
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were a jerk this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what it's worth, I didn't know about the suspension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that supposed to be an apology?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More like a conciliation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
ON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people now dance, and out onto the patio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
(slurring a bit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clears his throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the poets have mournfully sung, Death takes the innocent young, The screamingly funny, The rolling in money, And those who are very well hung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: "Gale! Gale! Gale!"
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling good but very much in control)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more. C'mon, one more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough. That's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you bow to the Queen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSS>
<DIRECTION>
David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT OF PATIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is chanting: "Ross! Ross! Ross!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse. Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS. Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He folds the towel.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a student anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think I want to know what that means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink -- they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There once was woman named Berlin, Who liked a bit now and again. Not now and again, But Now! And Again! And Again! And Again! And Again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cute, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a secret. But I have to come over there to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here I come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't after the grade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She stands with her body against him, looks into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Berlin, this, this is not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her fingers over his mouth, keeps them there.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ssshhhh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her face and lips as she speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate. Or... you can put your mouth on my body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and to her groin. She brings her mouth toward her fingers -- which are still against his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(softly, vulnerably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't reject me. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers, runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Hispanic woman (T-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the bathroom door. Tries the handle, then dances away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About eight dancers dance to the TECHNO MUSIC -- its pace increasing. A couple them are really into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rip them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rip them off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He does so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents waiting out a teenager's party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he takes his T-shirt off. The MUSIC from downstairs seems even LOUDER. His pants and underwear fall. He starts to penetrate her.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. From behind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, faces the mirror. He positions himself behind, enters her.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves against her.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her in the mirror, then continues. She watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PATIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dancers can be seen in the living room behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her in the mirror, unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He thrusts harder.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into her.
</DIRECTION>
<BERLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bite me. Bite my shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him do so in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dancers dance -- the TECHNO PACE has INCREASED even more. One dancer is a blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile.

Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes into her bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits.

BLACK.

INT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. She has stacks of paper spread in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. Wouldn't matter. Corrections would let him go. Governor Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works.' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition. Just like happened in England. Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(coming out of it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
He makes an effort, plays the "good listener."
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it hasn't happened, not since '76. And won't happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
David nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead men can't make a case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just keep it rational. The death penalty is expensive and ineffective. No one wants to see a murderer as a victim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um-hum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And stop that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Active listening. I hate active listeners. Makes me feel like I'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. Did you bring the Amnesty fax?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a copy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is looking out the window, caught in a thought.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to tell me what's up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night.

</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
(teasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you used a condom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
A longer beat. He holds her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Berlin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
She's stunned, then genuinely angry.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's great, great. I can hear the grapevine now. They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A power differential equals coercion. Great. You are so weak.

	Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God.

	I know you can tell yourself it's a position I aspire to, but believe me, I would rather...

She trails off. They stare at each other a beat. Then, she starts to collect the papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	I didn't mean --

</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.

As she collects, she winces, grabs her side.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan, let me say somethin' I always say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DIRECTION>
Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David -- something about the papers in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And that is I hate killin.' That's why my administration is willing to kill to stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with her.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got me, Professor. But let me, in my defense, give you a quote. Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DIRECTION>
The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance bites her lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The Governor makes an animated thinking face.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes. I would have to agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I say that, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, ma'am. That was Hitler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone more sincere.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. That it's expensive, inequably administered, that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that we may even be killing innocents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your game. Name one. Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure. One.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. David doesn't respond.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>

	Name one in the last twenty years. In any state in this country.

A long, miserable beat.

	Dead men can't make a case.

</DAVID>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, as my daddy used to say: If you can't find a problem, there probably isn't one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DIRECTION>
Constance shakes her head in irritation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKSTAGE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands. Constance stands nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you certainly had me on that Hitler quote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Governor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These debates are awfully good for the state, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've got to buzz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DIRECTION>
She moves toward her handlers.
</DIRECTION>
<GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You folks keep up the good work. We need that opposition.

</GOVERNOR_HARDIN>
<DIRECTION>
Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her.

EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your exact words were, 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work.' Now I'm telling you: Your ego's in the way of work.

</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>

(indicating the station)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means DeathWatch suffers because you're so anxious to finger authority, to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be. Learn to work without an audience. Try squeezing money from the donor list. Have you ever licked one single mail-out envelope?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s).

</DAVID>
<MAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rameriz, Austin police. This is Officer Haslinger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine it more closely.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, arguing with the Governor is a crime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The officers exchange a look.

(V.O.) (over the loudspeaker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gale, time's up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over to the guard's booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing. My skin was beneath her nails. It didn't look like anything but rape. Two days later she called the D.A., said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd she do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
A guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the back to be handcuffed.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

	Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be.

</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't signed, but I suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything written on it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you can know.'

EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms. Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the lot is wet.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try phone records, a net search.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking better than watching you work.

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
They walk a beat in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think he's telling the truth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ask me that. I don't know. There is no truth, only perspectives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't say that. If you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth -- it's a logical contradiction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, on the other hand, think Gale's telling the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the stairs and start up.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This you know telepathically?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just my perspective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: DAY TWO.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitsey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up. Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs paint and a lawn mower. In front of the house is a homemade sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See where it happened!" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8); someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH OF HOUSE 3307 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable silence, Bitsey extends her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is Zack Stemmons. We --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the tour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice is slacker monotone.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a twenty-dollar mandatory donation, apiece. But you get a re- enactment photo packet. It's got five pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta collect first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey reaches in her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and TV/VCR. A kitchen is adjacent. The walls are full of Goth bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In one corner is a very expensive STEREO, from which THE CURE plays. In another, a dead plant. The Goth Girl turns the MUSIC DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and curling sheet of plastic. Small packets of snapshots sit on the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book of clippings. There's also a guest book.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta sign the book. Doesn't have to be your real name, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey signs in.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First page says you're here to do research on violent crime. The state requires it for nonprofit shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Zack signs in.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a re-enactment photo packet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey does so. As does Zack.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you guys could share one, it would be really cool. The butt wipes where I do prints kinda jerk my chain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's me. My boyfriend took it. We also did a video. It's fifty bucks 'cause you can see my tits. There's a version without tits, that's thirty- five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway Murder (with breasts)! Copyright 1997! Svengali Productions!"
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do many people take the tour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so much anymore. We thought this would be like a busy week -- Gale gettin' the prune juice and all. Prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison, 'cause it gives you the shits. Most jerks just take a photo from the street. They shot a 'Real Crimes' episode here, but the owner didn't give us dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't mind living here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin' with my dickwad parents. It starts over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She let him crash here sometimes. He was like constantly wasted. Drank Black Label religiously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2).
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where the tripod was. My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. Gale must have buried them. These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not exactly a serial killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6).
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was like totally naked right here. The meter man saw her through the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. They found sticky stuff from the tape on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Zack picks up the gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He puts them back.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The totally sick part was where they found the key --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know, you can save that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Where was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was in her stomach, dude. He made her swallow it before he bagged her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Zack's shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's pretty much the highlight.

</GOTH_GIRL>

Got questions?

Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville. Zack smokes out the window.

<BITSEY>

<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>

They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same truck.

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking in hushed tones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off-the-record?

</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, we're off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling me someone's framing you?

</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(nods agreement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Maybe you're being paranoid?

David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto a large parking lot.
</DIRECTION>

INT. DAVID'S U.T. OFFICE - DAY

The office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls, fill the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass. There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY_LEAGUER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here, as I'm sure others have, and plead departmental cutbacks. Claim you need more publications, or I need a minority, whatever. All bull- geschichte. Your record's brilliant. You're an original voice worth -- in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil -- your weight in gold. Hell, it's not even the alcohol. It'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac. But, to speak plainly, if I hire you, in the eyes of the regents, alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a rapist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY_LEAGUER>

He takes a bite of bread.

Dark. David lies on the floor, his head propped against a wall. He's in his underwear and drinking from a Black Bush bottle.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.
</DIRECTION>
<BELYEU>

David chooses a club.

<BELYEU>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BELYEU>

David walks to the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So my chances of getting partial custody aren't good?

INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her hair is different.

EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup- container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back, waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic DOOR-LOCK BUTTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Constance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls, though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director -- a social gathering is going on behind him.

	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street: There's a liquor store.

David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand bleeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>

Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks. David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, holding Cloud Dog.

David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of the couch, holding the sheep.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know why Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes? 'Cause his real name was Judas. There were two Judases, Judai, the saint guy and the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, and tried to kiss him. Medievalers wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear of getting bad Judas on the line by mistake. Ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate. That's why. Then they changed his name.

She's not in the room.

	When I asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape.

The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down. Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where another Highway patrol car is stationed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive.

Standing among the six people in ponchos is Duke Grover.

They pass him in SLOW MOTION. He sees them, smiles, makes a "Hello" shooting-gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a life, waiting around for someone to die.

</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck, look.

<DIRECTION>
The next-to-last vehicle on the left is the Older Cowboy's pickup. He sits inside talking with another man. The Older Cowboy sees them, touches his hat as they pass.

<DIRECTION>
Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of duct tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey pushes the door open, looks in and around. She sees something, enters. Zack enters behind her, sees what she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll check the bathroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He goes. She approaches the middle of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room, in contrast to Zack's, is perfectly neat. It has two twin beds. The nightstand has been moved to the center. On it is a lamp, turned on. Suspended just above the lamp, a VHS cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BITSEY'S BATHROOM

</ZACK>
<BITSEY>

He starts to hook up the VCR.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't ask. I think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous. I still say we should do this in my room -- this one's a fucking crime scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints. I have the remote.

He turns ON the TV.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't look for D.N.A. when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. Here.

She hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates, looks back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you want to see what's on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Start it.

He puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits beside her. They watch the black leader appear.

CLOSEUP - TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her. She appears dead.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner of the screen is part of what looks like a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow. Also said you were right about not calling the police.

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, she keeps looking straight on.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna be okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts his arms around her as she starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes. The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's say Gale's right. Some sick- fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him up, arranged like the perfect murder. Why send a magazine journalist proof a few hours before he's won? Doesn't make sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's perfect. He knows News Magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it. Probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops. And, most importantly, knows I'll tell Gale tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does he give a shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale. I mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. You kill the one person he has left. Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing. And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lot of hate. You're talking beyond sadism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>

Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why release it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>

Expensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets --

Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CLERK sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just outside his door.

<BELYEU>

	You've been fraternizin' with the condemned. In the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape. He's a persuasive man, you're a out-of-state woman -- it don't look good on paper.

Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold "Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner.
</DIRECTION>

At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella.

(to Bitsey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. He's not your man. His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance. He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs don't mean shit.' They fired him. Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. The man adored her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why was he following us? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court. Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. David looks up at the microphone.

<DAVID>

	To make sure you honored your agreement, one for which there's no contract.

</DAVID>
<BITSEY>

	He would've said something.

</BITSEY>
<DAVID>

</DAVID>
<BITSEY>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in pain. He holds a child's drawing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - DRAWING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"), Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge"). Jorge is dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown.

INT. DEATHWATCH AUSTIN OFFICE - SUNRISE (6:09)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is tense. Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman, she murmurs quiet affirmations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's occupants all exchange glances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK OFFICE - SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's shockingly anemic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat, she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the marker in his hand. She looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Dusty stands, goes to the alley window.

<DIRECTION>
David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle, he sips his drink.

She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off into the yard. He takes her hand in his.

Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one hand supports her head, the other strokes her face.

They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless whispers, meld into one another.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold me tight.

INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's awake as David enters. He opens the curtains, sets a glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand. He crawls on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>

Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower. Turns the water on. She's caught in a thought, bites her lip.

She turns the water off.

David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right.

<DIRECTION>
He's sober.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's say they move back from Spain, that I somehow got my one weekend a month. Would it matter? By high school, I'd be his weak spot, the focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed pride. In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if I turn out like the old man?' Holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits. I mean, what girl comes home with you if there's talk that Pops is a rapist?

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.

<DAVID>

David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why.

</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks toward the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain; its letters run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple: You Kill, You Get Killed."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS at a table not far from theirs.
</DIRECTION>
<JOURNALIST_1>

Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey, lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks.

She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements timed out.

BITSEY

<DIRECTION>
has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a bed. She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands, looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack, stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She spits, hurries into the bedroom.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other exhibit pieces haven't changed.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And for the next hour I want you to do exactly what I say when I say to do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, all I want to hear from you is 'May I swallow.'

<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to suck his dick?

She starts to leave, turns back.

Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse.

CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK

reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or- less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move those index cards, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the index cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by- side.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zoom in a hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the gloves on a dish rack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOTH_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over them.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn them inside out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
He does so.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move the tape roll about a foot to the left. And get rid of the handcuffs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come check this, Zack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Goth Girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you... what's your name?

</BITSEY>
<GOTH_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nico's cool.

</GOTH_GIRL>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can imagine that part.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bitsey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll position her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the floor).
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine. Just straighten her legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape, however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Towel or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noticed this back at the hotel. See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The foot moves ever so slightly. She hits pause.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She moves her foot. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking good question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's another fifteen seconds before she comes to. If she had passed out once, without fresh air she wouldn't come back. There was no head trauma, her blood tested normal --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping he would go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey looks up at Nico.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to bag her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Woa. Not a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. Bitsey and Zack stand by the sink. A white plastic bag is now on the sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.
</DIRECTION>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<DIRECTION>
Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs. He tests them, then lays them on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Zack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I want you to wait three minutes before you take it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three full minutes. Just stand behind the tripod. Both of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag on her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the bag around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind, with some difficulty.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zack!

Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag open. She sucks air.

(ripping at the tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You okay? What if I'd've waited?

She tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more fucking experiments, all right? Just tell me what's going on. You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his arm, looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>

(still breathing heavily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She... she did it herself.

</BITSEY>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline, paces in front of them, thinking out loud.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. A murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, all right, maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the cuffs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why wear these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They threw me. I forgot you have to have the key to put them on. But she needed them. She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<NICO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' A, like when people hang themselves. At the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit. The police find their own skin beneath their nails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICO>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. She made sure there was no way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang yourself, or take pills. Why take your fucking clothes off? Why make it look like a murder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Bitsey contemplates.
</DIRECTION>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. The gloves. The damn tripod.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?

</ZACK>
<BITSEY>

	I don't know.

<ZACK>

<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Zack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make sense. The woman's a bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why frame an innocent man? Why send Gale to the chair for what looks --

</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's why! To prove it happens. To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's how she thought. She lived for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, why not die for it? That's why the tripod was here. To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. That's why we got an out-take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dead woman put the tape in your room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. She needed help, someone to keep it, release it. Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause...

They stare at each other a beat. The same thought:

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why he was fired from DeathWatch, and the A.C.L.U.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction, after a year or so. You know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it. And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which would only prove the system works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BITSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. What's one murder to stop thousands?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BITSEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution.

Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11 videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't.

She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.

Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western.

She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04. She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a city council meeting.

Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up on the screen. She hits eject.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: "Constance." The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring again. A beat of absolute silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.
</DIRECTION>

Constance turns from the sink:
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (her voice weak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTANCE>
<DIRECTION>
The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She puts the glass in the sink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another small section, drops the roll on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tapes the small section over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. She seals the bag around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her side, perfectly still, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BITSEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat.

Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands.

<DIRECTION>
The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't close the door. Starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs, and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past a sleepy farmhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs, and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. They rise on hill and then fall behind another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.
