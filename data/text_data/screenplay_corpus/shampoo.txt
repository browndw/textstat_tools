DARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th, 1968
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A darkness where even outlines are not discernible. There is a dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is PLAYING the BEACH BOYS: "When we could say good night and still stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through it there has been the SOUND of BANGING, distinct and rhythmic. It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS. There are also WHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... what?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That headboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody can hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
It BANGS a couple of more times.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can. It makes me nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
It continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging of the headboard. She follows the scream with a few yelps. Silence. Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (complimentary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus Christ... Jesus H. Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE CONTINUES TO RING.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (a slightly different tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to answer it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning no)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
It CONTINUES TO RING.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(being for her very mischievous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
And it does. It CONTINUES TO RING, killing all other considerations.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't give up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The GIRL'S VOICE on the other end of the phone can be HEARD only FITFULLY, when George holds the receiver loosely by his ear. It is TINA.
</DIRECTION>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What took you so long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't sure it was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(muffled)
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... uh... I... uh... can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter, sizing it up immediately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, who're you with? Jill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(lively but muffled)
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(she's heard Felicia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awww --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TINA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<TINA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(raucous laughter, muffled)
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tina)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and coughed.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I'm talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
This calms Felicia. A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, is she your girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you in love with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's not your problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You know too many sick ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I adore you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to kiss him, the SHEETS are RUSTLING. The PHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.

(firm but frightened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<JILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(muffled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

(muffled)
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
George flips on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Bare-assed, George swings out of bed, looking for something.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My keys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean that girl, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
George finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes, a pair of crumpled levis, and a brightly-colored shirt. He leaves his shorts and socks on the floor. He's obviously in a hurry.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What girl, she's not a girl, she's just a friend of mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
George sighs, shrugs, and heads toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, at least wait 'til I'm dressed. I'm going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to get out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Christ -- do you have any Kleenex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
George is a little desperate now. He runs to the bathroom, tosses her the whole box.
</DIRECTION>
<FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George is trying to remember the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's got a...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly interested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(anxious to go now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, that's very serious...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It turned out to be cancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Felicia can say anymore, George goes to the bathroom and grabs the first pill jar he can find, moves to Felicia and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
<DIRECTION>
(acquiescing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very rude... if you don't come back --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back in a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<FELICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to see you anymore.

</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back, baby, really.

</GEORGE>

EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George on his bike threads through traffic on the Strip. OVER this, we HEAR A FEW BARS of THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS "Monday, Monday." He pulls up to a signal beside a faded Eugene McCarthy billboard. Somebody HONKS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George!

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, baby, what's happening!

</GEORGE>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, stop by the shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off. Winds through alleys and heads up the hill to Jill's. It's a shortcut whose precision should make it obvious he's traveled it a number of times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AT JILL'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George jumps off his bike and pounds on the door.

</GEORGE>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jill starts to cry. She ambles into the carport in her nightgown.

INT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George sits talking, with MR. PETTIS, a bank vice president. He is perspiring a little. Somebody's breathing rather heavily. It's Mr. Pettis seated behind his desk now and opposite George. He's going over something.
</DIRECTION>
<PETTIS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you want to go in business for yourself?

</PETTIS>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<PETTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Pettis grabs a sheet off his desk, one in plastic containing rates.
</DIRECTION>
<PETTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETTIS>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<PETTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETTIS>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<PETTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETTIS>
<DIRECTION>
An uncomfortable pause.

	I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?

</GEORGE>
<PETTIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?

<DIRECTION>
At the shop on Brighton Way in Beverly Hills. A FEW BARS OF SIMON AND GARFUNKEL'S "SOUNDS OF SILENCE" covers George pulling up on his bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street is empty of traffic except there are scores and scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some meter maids. George starts toward the shop. A pair of women in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop. They look like Medusas. They hurtle down the sidewalk as if they're running from something. Then they find their respective cars and begin pouring pennies into the meters. CLINK, BUZZ, CLINK, BUZZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George looks glum. He's walking along the street. A GIRL stops him. She's driving by in a 3.4 Jag.

	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes into the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop. It covers most of the wall it leans against.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive young woman in her early thirties, everything matching, a real French garden, leans forward INTO SHOT and looks at herself in the mirror. She studies her image carefully. She moves closer to it. She seems uncertain at first. Then as she looks her conviction grows:
</DIRECTION>
<TINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great... great... great... great... great!
	</DIALOGUE>

She turns back to DENNIS LOLLY, her hairdresser. She takes his hand.

</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>

</FELICIA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

EXT. SHOP - DAY

Jill, in street, on verge of tears... moves to her car... gets in... sits for a long moment.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

George on bike pulls into office building. The MUSIC OVER is JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S "WHITE RABBIT."

INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - DAY

In his inner office.

LESTER'S on the telephone, staring out the window.

<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Kurt, I don't care where you have to go. I want Beluga Caviar there. Call Jurgenson's, call Chasen's... I don't care how much it costs... how much?... then spend it. Just make sure it's there. You've got all the money in the world to buy it. You understand? Just make sure it's there on the table tonight.

	You've got to do everything yourself. You know?

Suddenly Lester gives George a steely look. It covers his hair, his clothes. George is acutely uncomfortable.

<LESTER>

	Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

<LESTER>

</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
George sort of knows what Lester's driving at.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Long pause. George hasn't told Lester what he wants to know.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>

(CONT'D)

	It's an unusual trade.

	Yes it is.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward pause.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the important thing is you're successful at it.

</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way. But...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm better than the guy I work for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to interest Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.

</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After a while that hurts... doesn't it?

Lester smiles. He appreciates this.

</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly direct, almost enthusiastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...

The door bursts open. It's one of the SECRETARIES.

Jackie is right behind her. She bounces in, not seeing George.

<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry but I need an extra garage key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
In Lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she did with Jill. She's startled when she sees George.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for? What do you need the key for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie continues to stare at George.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.

(almost immediately on the defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right?

</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward pause.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Who's been doing your hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie glances at Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.

</JACKIE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George is going to open a shop.

</LESTER>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(really interested)

	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding? Your own shop?

</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
George starts to say yes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and Lester alone. Lester shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.

</LESTER>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you think I was talking to?

Jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very emotional.

<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a touch bitter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you were talking to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Lester's a little chagrined now but not much.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (an outburst)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.

</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
By her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this for months. Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to him genuinely upsets her. She's near tears and she's not the kind of girl who cries easily. Lester's sensitive to it.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, I know it's rough but at this point -- my business involves handling money for some very touchy people, politics and so on... Felicia's at a very difficult period in her life... any divorce and settlement and so forth, my finances would have to be looked into.

She's said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can be with him. Lester smiles. He's almost benign.

Felicia is throwing on a bandana and wraparound sunglasses. She seems in a hurry.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George stops and takes off his shirt. He's wearing a purple T shirt underneath. He goes back to cutting. Jackie's getting more and more edgy, partly because of George's proximity and partly because of her concern over what he's doing. George on the other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job at hand.

But it really gave you a feeling of accomplishment. I tell you I never had such a good time.

</GEORGE>
<RED_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, man!

And he laughs. George silently takes Jackie's hand and they move through the kitchen and out of doors toward the grounds in the rear of the house.

EXT. BISTRO PARKING LOT - JOHNNY POPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd has thinned out to a trickle, but Pope's red Porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JILL AND LESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester stands, swaying a little unsteadily in the lot. The Deputy secret service man seen twice earlier, comes on up to Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<DEPUTY>

	No bomb.

</DEPUTY>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DEPUTY>
<DIRECTION>
(he's serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good if there's no bomb. If there is a bomb and we can't find it, that's not good.

Lester thinks this over.

<JILL>

<LESTER>

(to Jill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what's the problem, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- his car. They have it blocked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh that's no problem.

<DIRECTION>
(to Deputy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DEPUTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY>
<DIRECTION>
Pope and Deputy go off together.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<DIRECTION>
They walk toward Pope's car. The trucks are being driven off.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything okay, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<DIRECTION>
He heads back into the Bistro. Lester and Jill stand outside the Porsche.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'll get in the back --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- there's not much room --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Lester opens the car door and pulls back the seat. He has a hell of a time squirming into the back, but tries to be lighthearted about it. Jill gets into the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door on the driver's side is still open and Lester's feet are poked out it. His head is pushing on the canvas top.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, nothin' to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jill turns and smiles, but it's a mistake since Lester's upper body is almost leaning on her as it is. Lester puts his hand behind Jill's head, forcing her to hold the position, almost nose to nose with Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jill.

</JILL>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(not moving his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jill can't really move her head back and Lester is obviously captivated by Jill's face.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to be casual)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- yes, Jill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(still holding her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.

</LESTER>
<JILL>
<DIRECTION>
(very uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(fondling her head, moving her closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- just wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
POPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is heading back to his car. He stops when he sees Lester's feet hanging out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<POPE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (another irritant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<DIRECTION>
Pope gets into the car.

<POPE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, what are we doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<DIRECTION>
Lester falls back and hits the isinglass rear window. Pope notices.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not.

</LESTER>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to, Les?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jill and Johnny Pope exchange glances. Jill shrugs to say, gee I'm sorry. Pope nods.
</DIRECTION>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Pope is furious. He starts the car, backs it up quickly, jostling Lester around as he goes. Lester chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEFORM SWIMMING POOL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool. The house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges and all sorts of random shrubbery. Jackie and George watch the Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a couple of androgenous men. The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi, arm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another end of the jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie smiles. She stretches, yawns.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(lazily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- very nice, very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(yes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- mmm --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. She glances at George scarcely moving her head.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but you never were much of a tit man --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm --

</GEORGE>
<JACKIE>

</GEORGE>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- yes, you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie laughs. The Twins have gotten onto some sort of splashing contest with the boys. Water hits George and Jackie. They're hit again. They shrug, George rises, takes Jackie's hand. They walk on around the pool, beside and along a maze of hedgerows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAMMY'S - THROUGH PORSCHE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose place is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAMMY'S FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
by the open staircase. Pope is greeting Sammy. Introducing Jill. Sammy's a tall, Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that goes to the knees on his levi's.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I know Jill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still sitting on the staircase, nursing her baby. She looks up, smiles at Lester, who manages a nod back, doesn't take his eyes off the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<POPE>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the bar's in there, Les.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<LES>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- oh, fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LES>
<DIRECTION>
He strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through the open foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Jill and George were earlier. Lester's ordered a drink. The huge black in the Afro offers him a toke. Lester stares at it dumbly.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(a little lamely, indicating drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his drink and half toasts the black. He stops and his eyes PAN the room. Lester is virtually the only person on his feet. Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep sofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely moving. In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke from the joints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - LESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester shakes his head as if to clear it. He takes a drink and almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe lights go on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do with his drink. He manages to stagger out of the strobe light effect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - JILL, RED DOG AND POPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jill stands over Red Dog who hasn't moved an inch, his measuring cup of wine still half filled.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so what's new, Red Dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<RED_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's the same old shit wherever you go, nothing ever changes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_DOG>
<DIRECTION>
Pope looks up, sees Lester just outside the kitchen door.
</DIRECTION>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jill, scraves is a --
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<DIRECTION>
He points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like he's about to enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the direction of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had taken earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
peers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt beards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and continues up it until he finds himself in a den.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and watching television. They seem a shade better dressed than those in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and partially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of it. He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- how's it going?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- is that Illinois?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<MAN_WITH_PIPE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a good look at Lester, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's Sally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_WITH_PIPE>
<DIRECTION>
Lester looks at the screen. Sally, handled by bare arms, is being placed on a foam rubber cushion. She laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(dumbly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Sally?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<MAN_WITH_PIPE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing with his pipe
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	stem to a girl by Lester's ear, also
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
watching the set)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Sally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_WITH_PIPE>
<DIRECTION>
Lester looks at Sally. She looks at Lester, nods. Turns back to screen to watch herself. Lester turns from Sally to see a television camera and the foam rubber mattress, now abandoned. Lester shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the pool. One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so when are you going to Egypt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean when are you going to Egypt?

Jill laughs. She turns and shakes her finger at Pope.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JILL>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jill stops cold. She turns to Pope.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.

</DIRECTION>

	Why didn't you tell me before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a flash of light from the poolhouse window. Jill turns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind. ANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. He's looking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. It opens again and he closes it again.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- do you want ice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
George pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie. Neither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis court lights which someone has turned on.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- we're kidding ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(staring right back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- we are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George moves to her. Jackie is waiting for him. They kiss. It is long and lingering and deliberate. George breaks away and goes to the poolhouse door. There's no lock, only an eye latch on the screen door. He latches it, tests it. It gives slightly. Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to Jackie who stands waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but what about her? I don't want to hurt Jill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
George takes the coke out of her hand. She lets him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe lights are going again in the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. The vision disturbs him greatly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get near her. She seems to move. He moves after her through the lights down the length of the room, going as quickly as prudence allows. Finally when they reach the end of the living room she's disappeared. Then he looks out and sees her poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged path that leads down to the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
have made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in sight. Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.
</DIRECTION>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- he'll never know the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POPE>
<DIRECTION>
Jill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<POPE>

(going along with it, protesting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you he won't know the difference.

<DIRECTION>
BY THE POOL - LESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step is a possible disaster.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN>
<DIRECTION>
(from Jacuzzi)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Lester looks down, sees one of the Twins. Her arm is outstretched, her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the shrubbery spotlights. She's holding a joint.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- it's getting soggy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Lester takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GUY_WITH_HER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- just put it on the bench over there and come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GUY_WITH_HER>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<THE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it over to the bench. He puts the joint down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stares at it. He looks up and there's the other Twin standing beside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel loosely flung over her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning joint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I have that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Lester silently hands it to her. Stares at the pool and the other Twin isn't there. He looks back and the one who had taken the joint is gone. He looks back to the pool and the other Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy in the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost falling down as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<THE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what is it now, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GUY>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where I can find a towel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<THE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the poolhouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Holding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over his boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse. He tries the door. The latch creaks. He pulls at it again and the latch pops open. He starts to open the door, then hears the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense love making. The girl is quite carried away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester hesitates. He listens as her sighs, interspersed with fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. He thinks better of it. He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly closes the screen door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side. He can't resist. He moves to it. He can't see anything. He moves closer. The dim, dark but classical outline of a man mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity can be SEEN. Lester watches. The SOUNDS are not as loud from this angle, but gradually they can be HEARD as the woman's cries grow louder. Lester is glued to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- there you are. Les. Les -- Les -- Les, we're leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants, not taking his face away from the window. Jill and Johnny Pope stand beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with genuine awe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- now that's what I call fucking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window.

As he does, a light begins to flood the room. It is the refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end table to another end table and to the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of George and Jackie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of the image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and determined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks past Jill without looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what --

She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.

George has leapt up.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey? Where've you been? We've been looking everywhere for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie doesn't move, only stares wide-eyed through the broken window at the screaming Jill.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
An ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the wall, and Jill can be SEEN now storming off with Pope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far window, pulls it open.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He's got the pants on backwards. He turns back to Jackie who has already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose into a purse.

(he grabs his shirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... wait here, honey --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi and into the maze of hedgerows. The Twins stand motionless side by side in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN_ONE>

</TWIN_TWO>
<DIRECTION>
George, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling Jill. He can't find her. He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy covered wall. He can't reach the top. He moves along the wall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. It's locked. He peers through the gate calling frantically:
</DIRECTION>
<GEROGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jill, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEROGE>
<DIRECTION>
Inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare teeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously. George chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He trips and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

George running through the strobe-lit party to the foyer. He's bare-footed, but his pants are on. His frilly shirt is unbuttoned.

</RED_DOG>
<DIRECTION>
George charges out the door in time to see the red Porsche's taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it purrs off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George turns and runs back into the house and through the strobe-lighting living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE POOLHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse. The refrigerator door still hangs open. Window glass is scattered on the floor, and George steps on it, cutting his foot, hopping a little, pulling out a shard. Jackie's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie?

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the poolhouse bathroom door.

George runs through the living room again and the strobe lights. Again he reaches the foyer. Red Dog is still there. George is heaving deeply now.

GEORGE charges out the door, this time seeing Jackie's 230SL pulling away, tires screeching.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down defeated. His foot is bleeding on the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George on his motorbike, COVERED by a few bars of Buffalo Springfield's 'For What It's Worth,' has thrown on a peacoat but kept on his velvet trousers. He's riding up what should now be a familiar road to Jill's. The lights from the city below flash in and out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JILL'S GARAGE - GEORGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls in. Her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the oil slick stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's the SOUND of a CAR coming down the road. He looks up expectantly. As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door. He pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside.

</OPERATOR_S_VOICE>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... thanks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Stares around the room. Jill's apartment is, as usual, good-little-girl tidy. (A contrast with Jackie's particularly kitchen.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George walks over to the window and look's at the city. He walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAY SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George opens his eyes. Above him is the carport and Jill's yellow Mustang has just pulled in. George rises. He walks into the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the kitchen, carrying the paper. The kitchen clock reads 4:44.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George glances at it. Then back at Jill. She looks at him, frightened but not moving. Her hair is stringy and she's got no makeup on. There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of which George will note in the course of the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George looks her up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to fight, George.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving to her, taking her arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do, Jill.

At this point he notes the arm bruise. Jill stares back at him unflinching. George smiles.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Jill doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to take off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe over it.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jill goes into the living room. George grabs her arm again.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>

<JILL>

He lets go of her. The PHONE RINGS. Jill answers it. Her tone alters appreciably.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi... listen, can I call you back?... Yes... no, everything's fine, really... bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>

She hangs up.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was him.

</GEORGE>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.

Jill smiles thinly.

<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</JILL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, did you get a job out of it at least?

</GEORGE>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to leave now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<DIRECTION>
George doesn't move. Jill goes over and fishes into a tote bag by the wall. She returns with Felicia's missing earring.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>

	Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.

George nods. Jill's anger is growing and her hurt is beginning to surface now. Tears start welling in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>

George stares at Jill. Then:

	Obviously.

</JILL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What difference does it make?

</GEORGE>
<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...

</JILL>

Jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable. George moves to her and tries to put his arms around her.

	Baby, please don't... I love you.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JILL>
<DIRECTION>
It's been rising in him the last few exchanges. Now all George's restraints seem to leave him. He stops trying to touch her and stands his ground, exploding:
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dumb cunt, everybody fucks everybody, grow up, for Christ's sakes. You're an antique, you know that? Look around you -- all of 'em, all these chicks they're all fucking, they're getting their hair done so they can go and fuck, that's what it's all about. Come into the shop tomorrow and I'll show you -- I fucked her, and her, and her, and her, and her -- I fucked 'em all!... That's what I do, I fuck. That's why I went to beauty school, to fuck. I can't help that, they're there and I do their hair and sometimes I fuck 'em. I stick it in and I pull it out and that's a fuck, it's not a crime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not even bothering to look at Jill. Jill has been pulled together a little more by the speech.
