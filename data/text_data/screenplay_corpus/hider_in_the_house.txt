EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a very lovely street in a very nice neighborhood, Tom Sykes, THE HIDER, is out for a walk. The Hider is a man who blends in well with his surroundings. A good-looking man in his thirties. To look at him, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider walks with such strange grace that he could be on a conveyor belt, a variety of neighborhood houses passing him by, one style after another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight and shadow play over the Hider's face as he walks, filtered through the lush trees and greenery all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the hedge he's walking past ends and the next house makes him stop. Because it isn't a house yet. It's a half-house. A house under reconstruction. Part built, part torn down, part finished, part matchstick frame. An evolving house, with a swarm of workmen all over it, hammering, sawing, drilling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider stands and watches awhile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The workmen have gone. The Hider enters the house from the back where it's all completely open without doors or windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider explores in the waning light. There are building materials about. He runs his hand over a pile of bricks. He looks at some wooden boards and planks leaning against a wall. WIND HOWLS through the dark house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries the tap on a newly installed sink. Water gushes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the main stairway will be is now only a ladder. The Hider climbs it to the next floor. There are a number of rooms; a hallway to more rooms. On a worktable are some plans and blueprints. The Hider looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind a door is a narrow little stairway. The Hider goes up it to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fairly large attic, with a small window at one end. The attic is a part of the house that has remained pretty much untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A trap door is opened. The Hider climbs out from the attic. He surveys the scene from up here. Below in the backyard there's an empty swimming pool, a partially completed patio, piles of dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because the house itself has many curves and corners and levels, so does the roof. The Hider jumps down to another section and teeters for a moment where there's a gaping hole (where the skylight will be). He catches himself. The hole goes right through the house all the way to the ground floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ATTIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider drops back in from the roof. He goes to the small window and looks out over the front street and neighborhood. The Hider feels tired. He lies down on the attic floor and curls up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE - EXT./INT. MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In which we SEE the gradual progress of the house as it grows toward completion -- juxtaposed with the activities of the Hider as he follows his own secret agenda:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE builders carefully fit a big skylight into place over that hole in the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE how the Hider spends his days -- in a library, studying diagrams in a book on Home Improvements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE him in the house at night, up in the attic, working on the floor in some way, hunched so we can't see. He's draped a black cloth over the attic window and is surrounded by candles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the house taking shape. Carpenters finishing a staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Hider eating alone in a simple cafeteria.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the back of the house at night. The Hider appears over the edge of the roof, rappelling down on a rope, making little toeholds in the wall as he goes. CHINK-CHINK with a small hammer, the SOUND MUFFLED by cloth. The house is quite private from the view of its neighbors, and the section of wall the Hider has chosen for his secret ladder is further shadowed by being an indented corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE plumbers at work and painters arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Hider cashing his disability insurance check at a check-cashing place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the house further along. Painters painting. Electricians wiring. Landscape gardeners planting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Hider returning to the house at night, emerging out of shadows. He goes to his special corner, looking around -- and starts climbing. His hands and shoes finding the chinks in the wall only he knows are there. In LONG SHOT, if we see the figure climbing fly-like up the side of the house at all, it's only because we know he's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE locksmiths installing locks on doors. Not that it will do any good now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Hider drop silently to the ground at night. Newly planted vines help hide his descent even more and cause natural shadows to move on the side of the house in the breeze of the night. The Hider walks down into the empty pool. He stands in the middle of it. There's a full moon. The Hider spreads his arms as if to float backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH! We SEE the Hider backstroking off one end of a long swimming pool. He rolls in the water and swims to the other end where he climbs out. The Hider is strong and powerfully built. He retrieves a towel from a bench. The towel says "YMCA."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Hider at his YMCA locker, after having a shower. Inside is everything he owns in the world. The locker is packed with stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the house nearing completion. Two men with clipboards walk around, checking final details.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They go up to the attic. Everything looks fine. They go back down, closing the attic stairway door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Hider at a booth in a coffee shop, sketching a diagram in a notebook while he eats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the house is done. And here the MAIN TITLES PAUSE. Because we are almost at the end of our set-up now. Just one more important job to be taken care of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's RAINING. The house is all finished. There are no more trucks parked on the street. No more rubble in the driveway. Nothing abnormal to set the house apart from any others on the street. The house is still and peaceful in the rain and part of the neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swimming pool has now been filled with water. And RAINDROPS pound into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rooms are stark and empty. White walls. Shiny wood floors. Light reflected off their smooth surfaces. Coming through the bare windowpanes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RECEPTION HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here by the solid front door, the house is an invitation. The hallway leading deeper in. Doors to rooms. The stairway to the next landing. The skylight over all, RAIN spattering up there on the thick glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only other NOISE, indistinct, is coming from the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider has the house to himself now. He's finishing his wall -- a false wall at the far end of the attic. The real wall goes straight for a while then juts off at an angle to form a sort of alcove. The Hider has bricked off this alcove, giving the illusion of one straight wall running the length of the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTIC - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain has stopped. Now the Hider is plastering his wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider is taking a breather. He stands looking out of the small attic window as he eats a sandwich. To the right, he sees a NASTY NEIGHBOR yell at some Kids who've come to retrieve their ball from his property. The Nasty Neighbor kicks the ball away as hard as he can. On the left, a car pulls into the driveway of the other neighboring house. A mother (the NICE NEIGHBOR) bringing her kids home from school -- a Boy and a Girl. Another boy comes by on a bike, pausing to talk to the first Boy. At a house across the street, the Hider hears a DOOR SHUT and sees a Cleaning Woman in a white uniform walk away along a path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider stands back to look over his handiwork. The false wall is now indistinguishable from the real wall. Such a good job that one wonders why the Hider built it, why he's cut off the extra space behind it, apparently without access...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... but wait. He's made a secret panel in the floor. By pushing down in a certain way then sliding away a section of floorboard, a hole is revealed, cut large enough to fit him like a coffin. He lies in it, covering himself up with the sliding floorboard again, which CLICKS neatly back into place, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE FALSE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as he rolls under the wall, coming up out of a similar trap on the other side. He slides a floorboard cover into place over it. He pulls down a foam mattress that he's cut to size and blankets from where they've been hooked up. He props up two pillows in place and sits against the front wall beyond which is the street. He looks over his shoulder, pulling the lever of a second vent he's installed in this wall for air and to enable him to look out over the street. Across the way, a mailman delivers mail to houses. A woman walking her dog says hello to the mailman. The Hider looks forward again. He's made a shelf or two for himself. There are a few books, some snacks, a Thermos and plastic bottles of water. He has a few other things. He has a lantern and a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The space here is big enough for him to lie down with his arms at his sides, or to stand comfortably. Like a monk in his cell, it's a room of his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ATTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent. Empty. The Hider behind the wall.

INT. THE HOUSE - BY THE PATIO DOORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCRATCHING at the glass. Then a TAP. And a CLINK. And a CLICK. And the curtain stirs -- and a Burglar slips in. He crouches by the floor a moment, listening and getting accustomed to the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Burglar opens the drawers of some cabinets in here. Looking for loot. It's after midnight and the lights are out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Burglar comes in. He goes over to the TV and crouches down to look at the VCR in the trolley underneath. He runs his hand over its smooth surface, then suddenly leans forward to unscrew cables at the back. This abrupt movement probably extends his life by a few minutes -- because when a hammer comes down on his head, the blow is only a glancing one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Burglar groans and turns -- the Hider was thrown off- balance by his miss -- and the Burglar has enough time to put an arm up for protection -- the second blow shattering his elbow. He cries out in pain, but he's a strong man himself. He's a match for the Hider! He manages to grab the Hider's ankle at the same time and pull him completely off-balance -- the Hider throwing his arm out to stop himself falling, knocking to the floor the vase he bought for Julie -- landing on the floor himself as it SMASHES alongside him -- and with a great gasp the Burglar pushes the big television off the trolley onto the Hider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider has the wind knocked out of him as the big TV lands heavily onto his chest, nearly squashing him like a bug. The Burglar is already running away, clutching his broken elbow -- but the Hider's powerful arm shoots out to catch his leg, pulling the Burglar back, while with an almost superhuman effort the Hider heaves the TV off his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Burglar struggles with all his might. The two men wrestle on the living room floor. The Burglar tries to gouge out the Hider's eyes. Craning his face out of the reach of the Burglar's flailing, frenzied fingers, the Hider tries to get a firm grasp on him. He grabs wildly at the Burglar's hair, finally getting a good hold. He smashes the Burglar's head onto the glass-topped coffee table. BANG, BANG, BANG -- the glass cracks -- BANG, BANG, BANG, the Burglar's face into the glass until the glass breaks completely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Burglar won't give up. He's beyond pain. He's only trying to survive. His hand is at the Hider's throat, squeezing. They throttle each ether. The Burglar is on his back, his legs kicking at the Hider. His shoe catches the Hider a kick to the ear. They both cough and gasp as a release is forced, both struggling for a better position, the Burglar trying to slide out from under again, the Hider keeping him down -- and now the Hider is able to seize the Burglar's arm again and jam the fingers in a door jamb and pull the door back. We don't hear the Burglar scream because the Hider's other hand is in his mouth, but the Burglar bites down so hard on it the Hider is the one who lets out a roar of animal agony and the Burglar's good hand punches at his face, the Burglar somehow on his feet again, trying to make it to the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider catches hold of the Burglar's shirt, tearing it. but pulling the Burglar back to the floor -- and the Hider's foot slips in some blood and he lands hard on his back, hitting his head, the Burglar's torn shirt in his hand. The Burglar is crawling on all fours to get away, but his knees slip in the blood, too, and the Hider's legs grapple him like a pair of pythons, pulling him back, and the two of them struggle on the slippery floor, out of breath, near exhaustion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a tall plant in the hall. The Hider stuffs the Burglar's face in the pot, suffocating him in the soggy earth. The Burglar's body twists and turns and kicks as he's smothered in the damp dirt, the tall plant shaking above the two of them, casting horrible shadows around the entrance hall in the moonlight cast from the skylight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider can barely hold the Burglar's head in place, every muscle tensing as the Burglar's body shudders in rebellion -- and then the tremendous surge as the Burglar's body breaks free! -- Tall plant tipping as the Burglar pushes back against the Hider with unbelievable strength -- tall plant falling -- the Burglar knocking the Hider back flat on the floor, the Burglar on top, but the Hider still hugging him in a death grip, then getting a full-nelson hold on the Burglar's shoulders and neck, the two of them struggling to a standing position again, the Hider again smacking the Burglar's head again and again and again, into the front door this time, the Burglar sinking back to the floor, still resisting, still breathing, his good hand still madly feeling for a grip on the Hider, but this time the Hider's hold is too strong and when he's got the Burglar on the floor again, he's able to get a knee into the small of the Burglar's back and with the knee as leverage and the full nelson on the Burglar's neck, the Hider pulls back with every last ounce of strength, pulling, pulling, moaning with the sheer effort of it until -- the Burglar's neck BREAKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hider rolls off, gasping for breath. He pulls himself to a sitting position against the front door. He sits here in the entrance hall under the moonlit skylight with the shadows and the dead Burglar and the blood and the earth all over the floor and he breathes air into his lungs as if he'll never get enough.

	I was alone a lot as a child. No one to compete with. My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things. When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody. You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.

EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

The Hider approaches his special part of the wall. In the shadows, his face is intense. This is it. He knows what he has to do. He starts climbing the wall. He's halfway up it -- when a FLASHLIGHT BEAM hits his face!!
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come down here.

The Hider climbs back down, shielding his eyes against the flashlight. The voice laughs, the beam lowering. It's the Nasty Neighbor.

And the Hider's face is wild with madness -- as he jams something against the Nasty Neighbor's stomach -- again and again and again -- stab after stab -- the strength of the Hider's arm lifting the Nasty Neighbor up off his feet -- as the Hider eviscerates him with -- a steel gardening trowel, the sharp point ripping the Nasty Neighbor's guts open, tearing upwards; the Nasty Neighbor's mouth gaping with the shock of it.

The Hider stands over Julie's bed. Watching her sleep. His eyes are completely crazy now, completely obsessed. His clothes are splattered with blood. He's snapped and their time together has come.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And yet, for a moment, something still holds him back. She's so beautiful. Tears come once more to the Hider's eyes. We SEE that he's building to a kind of crescendo of emotion. It's now or never. He begins to breathe quicker, he begins to move, to reach for her -- but suddenly the bedroom door is pushed all the way open -- the Hider managing to dart behind it just in time -- as Neil comes rushing into his mother's bedside.

The Hider pauses at the bottom of the stairs, looking back up, then turns in the darkness toward the front door and -- HOLY SHIT! -- runs smack into Phil! Phil was the intruder downstairs!

Julie and the kids hear the COMMOTION downstairs, sounds that are all the more frightening because they don't know what they are. For all they know it's one maniac down there destroying the house. Then they hear a CRY in the night:

The Hider's fingers lose the gardening trowel. Phil manages to keep hold of it, ramming it against the Hider's rib cage. The Hider shrieks in pain -- then slams his fist across Phil's head. The gardening trowel goes skittling across the floor. The Hider is out of control, on the rampage, insane with fury -- he punches off the mantelpiece the second green vase, SMASHING it into a million pieces.

It's Phil trying to stop him, clubbing him again with the phone. The Hider wrestles it away from him, wrapping the super-long flex cord around Phil's neck, strangling him, wrapping it tighter, pull it harder, and Phil is choking and the masked Hider is out of his mind -- and then the SOUND of POLICE RADIOS -- and the Hider has to run again. Phil still trying to hold onto him, but the Hider gets hold of the phone and beats Phil's head with it. Then the Hider escapes outside, still staggering.

As the WHISTLE BUILDS the Killer Dog turns. Nobody is approaching the kettle at the moment, so the Killer Dog doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what's going on with you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now she notices -- blood starting to seep through his trouser leg.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't know who you are, I don't know anything about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
She measures the distance between her and the WHISTLING KETTLE. The Killer Dog goes into a crouch.
</DIRECTION>
<HIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to show my feelings. I have to take action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIDER>
<DIRECTION>
THE KETTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WHISTLE reaches its HIGHEST PITCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rushes toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KILLER DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
springs at Julie!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throws himself in front of the Killer Dog. As the dog starts to tear him apart --
</DIRECTION>
<HIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Julie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIDER>
<DIRECTION>
JULIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drops the kettle, starts backing out of the kitchen in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie comes backing out from the kitchen, the kitchen door swinging closed after her. She keeps backing away, her hand to her mouth in horror as we HEAR the HORRIFIC MAULING, SNARLING, GROWLING from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRANCE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AWFUL SOUNDS continue as Julie in a daze keeps backing further and further away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street is empty, the neighborhood quiet -- except for the SOUNDS we HEAR of the Hider in the house being torn to bits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the CAMERA STARTS CRANING UP once more... up to the top of the house, moving in on that small vent up there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All his stuff still here. And his PHONE... which starts to RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGING in here, too, and OVER the savage MAULING SOUNDS the ANSWER MACHINE CLICKS on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRANCE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julie backing away.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (on machine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, we can't come to the phone right now -- please leave your message after the beep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
BEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's blood splashed on the walls. The SNARLING is starting to subside, CHEWING SOUNDS continuing.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (on machine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, hon, I'm still at the hospital, but everything's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN around the Hider's belongings, his shelf, his bulletin board...
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I really do think it's time for me to come home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
... his sign that says: "ALWAYS REMEMBER TO UNPLUG THE PHONE!!!"
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and the kids should have a man around the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
GROWL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
