EXT. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... Closer... Closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!* Lightning obliterates the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights, photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CITY STREET EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. Flash!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She seems nervous... scared even.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_TEENAGE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_TEENAGE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift into drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls out into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into the tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father worked the night shift here. Most nights he'd bring her with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was eleven years old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
His flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes flash photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, revealing another room.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it. This is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! Nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the constant sheet of rain beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn! This defroster never works...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_TEENAGE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Mmm... feels good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_TEENAGE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches her. His eyes linger on her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a problem with your car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>

She pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a nervous smile.

Brian's flashlight moves around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where she murdered her first victim. They found his body over in the corner, shot through the head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>

The flashlight continues to search through the darkness.

INT. 70'S CHEVY

Very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse.

The driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a soggy pack of matches. She looks at them... I look to the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<PRETTY_TEENAGE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My matches are all wet. You got a lighter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRETTY_TEENAGE_GIRL>
<DRIVER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my wife's car. Ah... there it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse. And stay there. She stares at the car lighter and... waits. The driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE

Carrie snaps another shot. Flash!! The blinding flash illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured remains of the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhhhhhhhh.

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian stops talking. Carrie scans the darkness. From the quiet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Thunderous Roar!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Blinding Flash!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As... a semi-trailer crosses paths with the 70'S CHEVY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on the girl. An intent expression on her face as she watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. His hand reaches deeper into her purse. The Driver tenses as he sees this. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POP!! The lighter ejects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver reaches for the dash. The girl hurriedly lifts something out from inside the bag. The Driver yanks the lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the rafters and catwalks. Scanning... Listening... Brian and Carrie glance tentatively at each other... Then slowly Carrie lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing into the rafters. Carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant Flash!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flash! Out of the inky black... The glistening wet rock emerges, hurtling downwards... Tumbling end over end through the night rain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 70'S CHEVY

The girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. She looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling slightly.

The girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips.

<DIRECTION>
When... in a THUNDEROUS CRASH!! The glistening wet rock comes smashing through their windshield!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The CHEVY brakes... Skids across the rain-slicked pavement and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the fractured front end of the overturned CHEVY. The twisted hunk of metal hisses... steams... groans. The front tire spins lazily to a halt on its mangled axle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACKGROUND - HIGH OVERHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a man standing on a highway overpass. He's leaning on the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY GRAYCE, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black hair, stands by the railing. Rain streaks down his expressionless face. He dropped the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY'S POV - THE 70'S CHEVY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lying in the deserted highway. The Driver crawls out covered with blood. Still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette lighter. Its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: CLOSER ON EARLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calmly looking down with no pity. Even closer... Water running down his face. Closer yet... On his eye... And right into the dilated pupil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping of powerful machinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - FEW MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise -- "shop talk," banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of making a blender of margaritas.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed.

EXT. LUCKY STREET GRILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks into the diner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain, walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Be right there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
The only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop juke box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OLD MAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(from beneath his shadowy brim...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a man's body. Seven heads and seven tails.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Early gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the waitress...
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make that to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front door slams shut!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT DINING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads "OPEN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked booths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously about the interior. No one in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly out of the quiet... a voice.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Size 6.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! Early leans out from behind the highback partition.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right ain't it, size 6?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress... smiles, nods shyly.

	Happy birthday Adele.

<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Early, you are so sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
This is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss, then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to try on her new shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.

A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.

INT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now if that ain't Momma's little angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to the news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE ON EARLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...two more victims last night, when a twenty pound rock smashed through the windshield of their car...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - EARLY'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The newscaster's voice continues to amplify...
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was the third such attack in the past month and while an extensive police operation is underway... no arrests have yet been made.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes his eyes and drifts back to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway of the trailer in her bathrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Early...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances around to make certain that no one's looking, then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Early smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then, remembers...
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr. Diebold was by again yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said, if he ain't got the rest of his money by the end of the month, he's gonna "kick us the...

Early works his jaw, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said that, huh? Cursed in front of you?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Adele nods.

Early gets in his car.

Early revs the raspy engine.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose he hears me inside?

Adele's words are unheard as Early pulls away flinging his beer bottle at a couple of chained PITBULLS in Diebold's front yard.

INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian enters the darkened loft interior.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I picked up some Chinese. Did you hear from the gallery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs address the sexual collision of opposites. "What if's." The subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(tentative)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got your slides back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice. He drifts toward the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic... not suitable for mass consumption... one of those... I forget. Who cares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down. She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on, it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of something 90 proof.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ Brian I'm dying here... you are too, you just don't know it yet. You're too busy working on that damned thesis... And, thing is... when you finally do finish it, it's just gonna get filed away on some shelf at the University Library... then what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian can see she's upset. Drowsy from the booze. He just watches her. Listens. Her words linger in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you wanted to be a writer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...just like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
The bold graphic sexual photographs of Carrie's continue to accentuate her comments.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's half the kick anyway. Doing something you've never done before. Experiencing something... different. Something... unpredictable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. He picks it up. Opens it. Inside, he finds the photographs Carrie took at the warehouse. Interested, he shuffles through them. He becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...These are great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He glances over to Carrie... she's fallen asleep. He reaches over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>

Early's Grand Prix has a head of steam up as it tears across the drive and hangs a hard right into his parking space next to the trailer. Suddenly, Early hits the brakes hard! Another car is parked there.

	Social call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAROLE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The Parole Officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers through things inside, as if searching for something. Early is getting pissed off but says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<PAROLE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.

He finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<PAROLE_OFFICER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PAROLE_OFFICER>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Parole Officer ignores the question. He steps up to a sink overflowing with dirty dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<PAROLE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That girlfriend of yours ain't much for housekeeping, is she.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAROLE_OFFICER>

Early dismisses the place with a glance.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking about moving...

Early opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer.
</DIRECTION>

	Maybe down to Texas... Probably get some work on them offshore oil rigs. Hear the pay's good... hell, the weather's got to be better'n here.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Early sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAROLE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? You know you can't leave the state.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hiccup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you can do is get a job.

<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Early lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer bottle, just inches from Early's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<PAROLE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I don't give two shits about what you want or don't want... I'm telling you to be there Friday, three o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner. You understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAROLE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
With that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You oughta think about putting a bag over your head... Might cure them hiccups.

After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.

Brian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious about it.

Just then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of them. Carrie snaps a final photo.

The little girl scans all their faces.

The little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie then back to the little girl.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Could I speak to your parents?

After an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the yard to the porch and opens the front door.

EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see into the entrance hall and through to the open front door. Brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters the house looking for her father. Inside the kitchen, right next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a purse on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has obviously seen the purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Brian motions for Carrie to join him.

Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins swinging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>

Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the little girl and her father step to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MIDDLE AGED FARMER with tanned leathery skin. He is not happy. Brian extends his hand...

	Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.

Adele swings higher. Her summer dress ripples in the wind. A smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KITCHEN WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early's entire arm is through the opening. His shoulder presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.

Brian glances back at the house. She interrupts his glance, kisses him.

Shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches from her porch.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THEIR TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's serious about his "eating."
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

(studying his map)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well we've come three hundred miles so far. Not a bad day's haul.

Brian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab to Early.

Brian bites at her neck. She stops talking. His sweating shoulder presses against her face. She turns her head to encourage him.

Their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. Intoxicates her. His aggression excites her. She pulls him into her. The metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as they make love.

Early takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out. It hits the Young Cracker. The Cracker looks down at his shirt in shock. Early is oblivious.

The Young Cracker moves to hit Early. Early swiftly smashes his beer bottle into the oncoming face. The Young Cracker doubles over clutching his face in agony. Early kicks him in the face, sending the Young Cracker to the ground. Early finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two large tough guys approach Early and Brian. Brian's heart racing, Early cool as a cucumber. Instead of taking on Early, they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. The waitress returns to their table.

Carrie and Adele split the last bottle of beer between them. They are sitting on the floor and Adele has Carrie's foot in her lap. She's painting Carrie's toenails bright red. Neither of them is feeling any pain.

<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.

LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>

Carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. Brian leans out the bathroom door:
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.

</BRIAN>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!

Brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid of me!") He pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course! The accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... He's got to be a mass murderer!

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else could he be?

</BRIAN>

He switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, and begins to pull his jeans off. Carrie climbs into bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a Republican!

Brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. Carrie switches off the the only light in the room. In the dark, we hear a thud as Brian trips over a chair.

EXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the far end of a narrow hallway, Carrie finds an ice machine rumbling away noisily. The only illumination, a single fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE ICE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of her eye, she notices...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The silhouette of a man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for another way out. There is none.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the fluorescent light. It's Early.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Brian hurt his foot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?

<DIRECTION>
(he turns his back to show her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and down my back... right into my pants.

</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between his shoulder blades and along his back.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and everything starts stickin' together... keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin' for my boots, see who gets there first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his ass. She diverts her glance.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never get that hot, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see that his ice cube has melted.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta get back before this ice melts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice cube. His face only inches from hers.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...never?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, never. Excuse me.

Carrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover. There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie from the argument the night before. Early is in the back with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans.

<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daddy always took sauerkraut juice and tobasco sauce for a hangover, mixed in one egg not two, and some tomato juice...

Brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car pulls away.

<DIRECTION>
CARRIE'S POV: IN THE MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her. Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again. The next instant, unexpectedly...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. LINCOLN

She furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt.

Brian's heads bangs against the side window.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

Carrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles.

</BRIAN>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Brian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Brian fires off another shot, misses again.

<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bri', you're jerkin' it when you pull the trigger, hold it real steady.

Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boys'll be boys.

</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know any tricks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADELE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer.
</DIRECTION>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna learn some?

Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian.

Early helps Brian to hold the gun.

<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steady... Breath in... now let half of it out, and... fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow after her... But Early grabs his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bri, I want you to keep this gun... consider it a present. Never know, California could turn out to be a dangerous place.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR ABATTOIR - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In the distance, we see a large rundown building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN OLD DESERTED ABATTOIR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele and sees that they are amorously engaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the glove compartment.

Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white top starts to come up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABATTOIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat- hooks hanging from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet and uncommunicative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. Brian pops a cassette in the player.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the fact that this place repels her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman being tortured and pleading for her life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH!! FLASH!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams from the audio tape bounce off the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(speaks into his small
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His mother had him working in here before he was eight years old... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into another room.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When she was pissed at him, she'd beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady whimpering.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Eventually the boy wakes up one morning, picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH!! FLASH!!

Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. Brian follows after her.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>

</BRIAN>
<CARRIE>

Carrie wheels around to face him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm it, turn that thing off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She switches off the cassette player.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?

	But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and makes her way toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LINCOLN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... Early and Adele fucking wildly!
</DIRECTION>

Carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on them.

THROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's finger presses down on the button, CLICK!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... Talking dirty to Adele.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the motor drive once all the film is shot out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him.

INT. GAS STATION

The only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception.

On the counter next to him Early notices a large stuffed "happy face" display. "Free with every 20 gallon purchase."

He grabs one, stares at its face curiously.

Suddenly... He puts the barrel of the gun between the "happy face" eyes... Points it at the back of the attendant's head.

Early notices that Brian is watching him intently. He mistakes Brian's interest for hunger.

<EARLY>

Brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts them back down and, like Early, gulps from the container.

NEARBY, Carrie sits quietly. As she listens to the two men talk... she notices something on her arm. She lifts her arm up to get a closer look.

She sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling to her. Closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers is tinged with blood. The Gas Station Attendant's. It freaks her.

Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the kitchen door, bewildered. Then...

When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees Brian and Carrie standing.

He looks at her and begins to squeeze...
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop lyin'... I can see right through you.

EXT. DESERT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word, reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up and throws it out the window.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - LATER, THE SUN IS ON THE HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln has had it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 1950's style building.
</DIRECTION>

INT. LINCOLN

Early opens the back door. He grabs a box of supplies (some rope, a kerosene lamp etc.)

A living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. Sand covers everything... Including...

A FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen counter... The little girl is seated at a table... The little boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed about the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EARLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one on the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he begins to move toward her. The time has arrived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around his neck and kisses him deep and hard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, the palm of her right hand is bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass protruding from his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and onto his jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, intertwined in a grotesque sexual position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - BRIAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road ahead and the swirling sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then... As the pickup truck comes around a corner Suddenly... directly in front of him -- Headlights!!

Brian reacts... too late!!

The pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle, and tumbles end over end through the open desert, before finally coming to an abrupt halt.

Sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked pickup truck. Brian is upside down with his eyes shut. A trickle of blood runs down his face.

In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45 automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps around the front door frame... It looks like a magical "door" shrouded in a wall of light!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EARLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... the morning sun rising. With that he turns his attention back to the front door!
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew there was doors out here!

He walks toward the doorway of light. He grins as he opens the "door" and steps through it. The sunlight momentarily blinding him.

A black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... Eventually it blocks out all the light until... WHAAMM!!!!

EXT. DOOR

A blow knocks Early back through the doorway. He slams to the ground, on his back. The gun falls from his jeans and slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the blood covered remains of his face, he tries to get up, but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian, silhouetted, steps into the doorway. He holds a shovel raised, ready to deliver a second, fatal blow... but when he sees Early incapacitated on the floor, he lowers the shovel to his side. His handcuffed hands reach down and picks up Early's gun. He trains it on Early, then walks around him to enter the house. Brian's eyes slowly adjust to the interior...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARLY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From on his back, Early looks out the open "door." He sees two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand, reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes that the glass, placed there by Brian, is what created the effect of the "door." He starts to laugh.

He moves into the back bedroom and finds Carrie. She is crouched on the floor, handcuffed to the bedframe. He moves to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes. With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early. in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the room. He wields the pistol toward the ground where Early lay... but Early's not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from behind him, Early grabs him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife toward his throat!
</DIRECTION>

Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to his knees.

	Go ahead Bri, ask me something.

(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna know how I'm feeling'? Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
On all fours, Brian reaches out for the gun, but Early kicks it across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout you? You feelin' good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Another kick to Brian's chest. The wind rushes out of him.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...'Cause you sure don't look so good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. That it, you feeling powerful? Superior? I know I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of Brian's face! His head snaps back, his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls flat to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now why would I be angry with my daddy... you're the one hit me with the shovel. And you're the one's gonna wish you hadn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
With one last effort, Brian manages to pull himself back up to his knees. He focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway. Early moves toward him, knife in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past. Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face. Early stumbles backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires. Hitting Early square in the chest!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm drops back down to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<EARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Bri... I think I need a doctor. What d'ya say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLY>
<DIRECTION>
The two men stare at one another for a moment... then Brian, with one hand still on the handcuff keys, shoves the .45 automatic firmly under Early's chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON BRIAN
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Sorry 'bout this Early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
o.s. BANG!! rings out as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on the chain and keys snapping free from Early's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on Brian's handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on Carrie's handcuff swinging empty against the rusty bedpost.
