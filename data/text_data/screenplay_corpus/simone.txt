:SC: SIMONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression of looking through a kaleidoscope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are inside a CANDY BOWL. A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man performing this curious task is writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties, conservatively dressed in suit and tie. He sits alone at an empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage, some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows the table's paper cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor finishes sorting. Finding no trash can to deposit the rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches. He looks ill.
</DIRECTION>
<P_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taransky --
	</DIALOGUE>
</P_A>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's walking?... Don't tell me she's walking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(blood slowly draining from his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is not walking... She can't walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes from a movie trailer to a limousine. VIKTOR desperately follows after Nicola.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Nicola! How was your massage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in breach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(wheeling on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the size of the role, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly very cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding the enormous
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	silver fish behind them,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the biggest on earth! I swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taller, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taller? What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor looks up in horror. The trailer next to Nicola's does indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(walking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've insulted me for the last time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor looks to the tires. His face suddenly brightens.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicola, it's just the tires -- they're over-inflated! I can fix it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen. Air hisses out.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, it's lower already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her PUBLICIST. Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg you. You can't do this to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had three other offers. I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then show some. They'll shut me down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(opening the car door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't working anyhow. The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film. I don't think anyone will understand it. I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, Nicola, you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up her last piece of luggage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, let me help you with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding the door for her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to go. The truth is I don't deserve you. This film doesn't deserve you. Frankly, it deserves much, much better. The reason it's not working is because you're not about the work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Nicola is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the limo driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Hell, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The door slams and the limo roars away. Viktor looks to the still hissing trailer tire. The CREW regards Viktor apprehensively.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the crew)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at? Get back to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a veil of netting. A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack... are you there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here. I'm right beside you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
A NUN enters.
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should really go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's alright. Please, let him stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
The nun withdraws. Hal holds his face in his hands, almost breaking down.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(a glance to heaven)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of cruel God is it that would take you away from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same one who brought me to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... I cannot accept it. If something like this can happen. What...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling to find the words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles through her pain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Why are we here? Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here? No why. Just here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Nicola dies peacefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go up. The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's good. You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've analyzed the footage. We've got almost everything we need in the can. If we rework the script, we can finish the film without her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
<DIRECTION>
(forceful shake of the head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today. They'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(more anxious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we'll re-cast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a re-make, Hal. Anders is not bigger than this picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine finally speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she is. No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need a name. We'll cast an unknown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't play opposite an unknown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't sell an unknown. Nicola's soured on the project and we have to accept that. If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(aghast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(a wince, addressing everyone but Viktor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous soundstage. They speak more freely in each other's company.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Difficult. I'm difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the candy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(talking a piece of candy and eating it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's. Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'll tell you why. It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What's wrong with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine, she doesn't have any children!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing her arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see? We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The public decides who's on that list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the truth. Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy. We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can hardly make a profit with them. Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(staring wistful, into space)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars. We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date. When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding him as if he's insane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated at her infuriating logic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(rolling her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's called a projector.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal. This is business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spare me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at the studio lot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this? This is about investment and return. Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Viktor reads Elaine's face.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not renewing my contract.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I? Your last three pictures tanked. The board is giving me hell. No bankable star will work with you after this. If you just compromised... a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the news.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(rueful smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate moment between them.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(softening, a heart-to heart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal. You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey. I called what's his name at Warner's. He said he'd take a meeting -- in July. I've fought for you Viktor...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice trails off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to talk severance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(staring off into the distance, face hardening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The picture's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(believing she's getting off lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need a star. All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor. A real leading lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor. If they're good, they get known. And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing him on the cheek
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	as she departs in her
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
studio golf cart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left alone on the deserted lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame. VIKTOR's face appears amongst them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer of an electric cart. A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional standees from around the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out -- we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop computer.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly ashamed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, sweetheart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey smiles sweetly. She hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Mom canned you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really... not anything, Lainey. It's just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't feel too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing to a standee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her. You're better off out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding his daughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look very grown up. What are you doing? You meeting your mom for dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother, ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctant admission)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kent got tickets to the ballet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to convince
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	himself as much as
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart. It's important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>

(not quite convinced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you'll do it, Dad. You're Viktor Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye. She runs to her mother and Kent.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. I'm Viktor Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of VIKTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had no choice, Elaine. He's a liability.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<ELAINE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.

Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.

EXT. STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on a copy of "Variety". The front page banner headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative Differences"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on a studio tour -- HANK ALENO. He wears a pair of spectacles with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side. It is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one good eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TARANSKY CALLS A-LIST: "OVER-PRICED, OVER-PAMPERED PRIMA DONNAS" - Director's Future Now In Doubt -.

When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway entrance. The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay With The Tour".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding several framed black and white photographs of screen legends under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor. He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated Bentley.
</DIRECTION>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God. I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through. I told her it was a matter of life and death. I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --

Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the man's motives.

(trying to reassure)
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You were booed off the stage. That's got to be -- ?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good for you, Hank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to his covered eye)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good and bad. They think that's what caused this. Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen. It's the size of a grapefruit. Heavy too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding the pathetic

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be. It was worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<DIRECTION>
Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket. Viktor now understands the significance of the gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to see her.

</HANK>
<VIKTOR>

	I've seen them all before.

	Not like this --

</HANK>
<VIKTOR>

	Come on, Hank. A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?

</VIKTOR>
<HANK>

(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We call them "vactors".

</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need flesh and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Flesh is weak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor loads his film cans into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<HANK>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to Nicola in Variety)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already do. But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers, conspiratorial)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the point, Hank. No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse. Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed. It can't be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know anything about computers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why you're so perfect. You have something I don't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An eye -- for performance. You know the truth when you see it. I know. I've seen your movies. I love your movies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Straw God" changed my life.

<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.

<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.

<HANK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't be here next week. The tumor's inoperable. I'll be dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(winding down the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm already dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's car roars away. He looks back at the forlorn Hank in the rear view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This week!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<DIRECTION>
A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of ingenue headshots. Black X's are drawn through all of them. VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone, referring to a young woman's headshot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What do you mean she won't work with me? She's done nothing. She doesn't have a single credit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<AGENT_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(from phone, off-camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Better no credits than a Taransky credit. No young actress is going to step into Nicola Anders' shoes and risk ending her career before it's even started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_S_VOICE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Art, you don't understand. I've mortgaged everything to finish this film -- creditors calling, coming to the house, for God's sake, I need this --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The phone goes dead. Viktor tries to re-dial -- disconnected.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Sharp knock on his door. Viktor peers through a curtain and spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks to be a legal notice in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor slips out of the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR hurries along the beach. When he turns, he discovers the MAN IN THE SUIT following him. As Viktor runs, the Suit runs -- calling out to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_IN_THE_SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_THE_SUIT>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(calling back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor stumbles. When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_IN_THE_SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(showing him Hank's
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	obituary in the L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Times)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that you have this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_THE_SUIT>
<DIRECTION>
The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAN_IN_THE_SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea, Sir. He wanted you to have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_THE_SUIT>
<DIRECTION>
The Suit departs. Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive. The hard-drive is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIX MONTHS LATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR. The red carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET". To save money on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere. No paparazzi, no limos, no klieg lights. Resorting to giving away tickets to PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in trash.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to see a free movie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HOMELESS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(he thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMELESS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi pulls up. Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing him hello)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Lainey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough cash. Lainey pays herself.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother couldn't make it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell". But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She still with Kent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This week anyhow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding the pathetic premiere. As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's sole spotlight expires.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite how I imagined it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking on the bright side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was no other way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed you. I wondered if you were ever coming back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding the makeshift
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	poster, trying to lift
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his spirits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I... don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she here tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She can't watch herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
</DIRECTION>
<THEATER_OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Hey, we have to start. I've got "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEATER_OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A foggy, empty pier. A MAN is running through the mist, shouting desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valarie! VALARIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and hood, her back to us. The camera pushes in, music swells and she turns. SIMONE. She is exquisitely, ethereally beautiful. Perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is playing ON THE SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS change. They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER OWNER. Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their faces, some opened-mouthed.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(ON SCREEN, approaching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valarie, what are you running from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(enigmatic smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Valarie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out. Simone collapses to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(running to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valarie! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth. Viktor finally musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same scene that played in the studio screening room. However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Why are we here? Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here? No why. Just here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying. Now even LAINEY is affected by Simone's performance. She wipes a tear from her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the audience reaction. Finally the credits roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dedication, "For HANK".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one moves from their seats. Viktor permits himself a brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the credits:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no one moves from their seats. Viktor cannot stand it any longer. He runs to the restroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with water. He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own reflection. He rehearses a courtroom speech.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions, to send a message to the acting community who put themselves above the work and above --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom. They approach the urinals.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_1>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing their
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	conversation from the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
lobby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- So fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_1>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Totally artificial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_2>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing the end of their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're really supposed to believe that was 19th Century Lisbon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_1>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's looking at the sets when she is on the screen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_3>
<DIRECTION>
All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR exits the restroom. Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS, including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing out her father)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is. That's my dad, Viktor Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group spontaneously applauds. They rush to shake his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She is magnificent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_4>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Absolutely unreal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_5>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't too... cartoony?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_6>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Who? The nun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_6>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_7>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Or are you talking about the mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_7>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_8>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- A star like that, who cares about the supporting cast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_8>
<AUDIENCE_MEMBER_9>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Congratulations again. She was... not of this earth. You should be very proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDIENCE_MEMBER_9>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Not of this earth". A good way of putting it. And the film as a whole -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a miracle, Dad. Where did you find her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(vague)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw her picture on the, er... internet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrogating his daughter's face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only her brilliance. To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck. You really pulled it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a feeling mom is going to take you back after this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's head snaps around. Lainey smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back on the lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail. His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message light reads "FULL". He hits the "PLAY" button.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, you bastard! I hear it's great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, I'm happy for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine from happier times. He gazes at it as he listens to the message.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know people are going to be beating down your door but... well, I'd love the chance to buy back something I gave away for free. Don't you just love Hollywood?... BEEP.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor stops the machine, dazed. He idly opens his mail. Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's name, "SIMONE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown movie theater as far as the eye can see.
</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dazzling new ingenue has come from seemingly nowhere to capture the hearts of movie-going audiences across the nation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>

B) THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads, "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In "SUNRISE".

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in her debut film, "Sunrise, Sunset".
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
C) A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first website dedicated to SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her face is already posted on everything from websites to bedroom walls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
D) Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion craze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
E) In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a camcorder.
</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And bootleg copies of her film are being sold in back alleys all over the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
F) A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy: Taransky Productions".
</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(from TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But who is Simone? We know so little about her. No details of her background have been released, not even her age. She is somewhere between a girl and a woman. A fresh face and familiar both at the same time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
G) The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a multiplex. The marquee has 16 screens and looks like this:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET." "SUNRISE, SUNSET."

</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Simone even her real name? And why the secrecy? All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine, corrects the reporter.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Taransky.

</VIKTOR>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(from the TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has parlayed his relationship with the new sensation into a three picture deal with the very studio that dumped him only six months ago. And no wonder with the starlet's performance breaking all box office records.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO GATE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a glimpse of SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<MOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone! SIMONE! I LOVE YOU! I Want to BE you!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's limousine on the studio steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready. A banner reads, "Welcome SIMONE". A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR steps out of the car. ELAINE pushes past him, into the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone!... Simone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The car is empty.

	Good to see you too, Elaine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring his sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why isn't she with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine sighs, exasperated.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissing her colleagues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to work, everyone. She's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have it on me. Anyway, it means a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly changing tack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you read the reviews? They're love letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from a newspaper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to this one. "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(musing to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wait to meet her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if that's going to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I say, she's... something of a recluse. That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(face falling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be ridiculous. I arranged a press conference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of the question. A circus like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, it's my studio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's my actor. There are other studios, Elaine. There's only one Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaving her on the steps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the press conference to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor strides up the studio steps. Elaine stares after her ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound arrogance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent fame by association.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(tapping the microphone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_1>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taransky, Viktor. T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y, V-i-k-t-o-r.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but -- who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_1>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(patronizing smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a two-time Academy Award nominated director with over eighteen films to my credit thus far including my latest release, "Sunrise, Sunset". Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not be taking any questions. However I do have a statement to read on behalf of my leading lady, Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from his statement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"To Whom It May Concern. I'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr. Taransky's film. At this time I will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances since I am really nothing without the beautiful worlds and characters Mr. Taransky creates for me. I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself. All questions and inquiries should be directed to Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all aspects of my career. Yours very truly, Simone".
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The reporters all call out at once.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone dating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_2>
<REPORTER_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Viktor, where'd you find her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_3>
<REPORTER_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Is Simone her real name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_4>
<REPORTER_5>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What's she got to hide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_5>
<REPORTER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Is she the new Garbo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_1>
<REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Who's Garbo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_2>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I made it clear -- no questions regarding Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bringing the press
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	conference to a hasty
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
conclusion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I would like to close by announcing that Miss Simone begins production today on her next film, "Eternity Forever". This project has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a tinge of bitterness, then a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor exits the podium. A voice stops him in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you think you're fooling, Taransky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor turns. The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading, truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied by his assistant, MILTON.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max Sayer -- National Echo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(regaining his composure, a smirk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you have a real story to write? Why aren't you in Latin America?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols. If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are alive, Sayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So they're probably here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hardly missing a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman? The public has a right to know. Why is she staying out of sight? And why the hell is she with you? I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer. Look it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know all about integrity. I know even more about persistence. Look that one up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera panning the entrance. A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch, nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf cart, script in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Miss Simone coming today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's already here. She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(admonishing guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if it catches on fire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it burn. Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters the soundstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two side monitors. VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself as he inserts
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	his Hollywood hard-drive
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
-- SIMULATION ONE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pay no attention to the man behind the computer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A title appears on his computer screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welcome to SIMULATION ONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he revises the title to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Welcome to SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian emerges -- SIMONE. She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and blood actress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background -- titled "VISUAL LOOP 6". Within the confines of the monitor she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal. She looks a little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for too long.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A star is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... digitized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a key on his keyboard. When he speaks, she speaks. Simone's voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to Viktor's voice. A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to mimic his movements.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean they buy it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous smile as he
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	examines his first
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
royalty check)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy it? They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(depressing the button
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	every time he wants to express his thoughts
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
through Simone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any idea what this means, Simone? Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(appearing to indulge Viktor with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the death of real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(pondering the enormity of the hoax)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are birth of... what? A Phenomenon. A miracle. A new era in show business. All I wanted to do was finish the film.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own amusement. He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm... a little less Streep, a little more Bacall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and dead, that comprise Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment. The voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic representations of the sound waves.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself. He scrolls through the list of screen legends. He clicks on the image of AUDREY HEPBURN.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While I think of it, I'd like you to add something to your repertoire -- remember that thing Hepburn does in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on the screen. Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY_HEPBURN>
<DIRECTION>
(from the screen, an incomparable smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY_HEPBURN>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing the moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hear you say "Hi" like Audrey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly into a frozen Simone. Viktor presses play.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(imitating Audrey's performance perfectly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stretching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I'm so relaxed around you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did create me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you. I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. You're right. Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist. That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to his theme. SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor, nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice raising in excitement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real. Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway. Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(Simone appears to look directly at her maker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only real truth is in the work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I'm talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pondering his own question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking the thought from his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not, "Eternity Forever"? The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made? I'd kill for that part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you'd say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(pretending to be hard of hearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button. He is unable to resist speaking another line.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I will never, ever leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss -- until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked, "GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS, FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor comes close to the monitor. He notices something about Simone's face.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so beautiful. Too beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES". He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast, empty soundstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR's face against the SKY. As he walks, we reveal that the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the studio lot -- behind a parking lot. Viktor hands his valet ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. We gave you a complimentary car wash -- they're washing the engine now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for their cars under an umbrella. A young TALENT AGENT approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<TALENT_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor! Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back last year. I was, er... out of the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(strained moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we should get together. My schedule's wide open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALENT_AGENT>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I'll... "call you".
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The agent's face falls. He gets in his car, disconsolate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Hal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The film. The chemistry. No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never were together, Hal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And still the connection was undeniable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(aside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant. And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(correcting him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clyde.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lowering his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? She didn't mention it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly covering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable. I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on his cell phone. The phone rings. Viktor feigns surprise and answers.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(answering the phone he
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	has just dialed, louder
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
than necessary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?... SIMONE! How are you, sweetheart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A hush descends over the executives. Hal is suddenly very uncomfortable. Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(winking to Hal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was more in passing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>

	Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star. Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.
	</DIALOGUE>

(a shrug of apology to the appalled Hal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...

<DIRECTION>
(covering phone, to Hal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try to talk her into it.
	</DIALOGUE>

The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark. A mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing into his car.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Listen this is a bad place to talk... what?... sweetheart, I know you have charity work you want to do, I know you want to give back -- but remember, your greatest gift is your talent... we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend... I'm looking forward to it too.

Viktor hangs up. His car pulls up. He tips extravagantly and drives away. The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell phones.

EXT. STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY

Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded windows.

INT. CAR - DAY

Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a computer.

</MILTON>

	Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions. Some kind of new encryption.

INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast. Lainey is in her pajamas, occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father prepares French toast.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing to the computer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you stop that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world. You can lose yourself. You should get out more. How are you going to meet boys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs coyly, getting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know plenty of boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Who? Where do you meet them? In a chat room? How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You do? Still? I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the one who insisted on it. Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You understood them. That's what was amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking out the window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a nice day. Let's eat outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door. We hear a chorus of CLICKS.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it may be nicer inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor joins her at the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here, I'll deal with this.

Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS. The next door houses have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist waving extravagantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a nearby rooftop. The photographer limps towards the fence. Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly relishing the attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't her, Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER_1>
<ECHO_PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she? You can't hide her forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ECHO_PHOTOGRAPHER>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(hurling the camera into the mob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never find her. Simone only appears when I want her to appear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob, accompanied by assistant MILTON.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky. Are you holding her hostage? Are you some kind of Svengali?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(recognizing the reporter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you? You look kind of "captive" yourself. While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist. Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops? The cops read my column to know who to bust. We're the only watchdog the public has.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around at the photographers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of this is going away. We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that. Until you slip up. And you will. You are looking at your shadow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting in his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice try. If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative. I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>

	I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.

INT. VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the passenger seat. They have become so blase about the paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(switching off the radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I'm really sorry about all this. I don't know if it's safe for you to stay the weekends... just until things settle down.

</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I know, I don't know anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly irritated by her lack of interest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.

Lainey gives her father a smile. Through the car window behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops down a bank.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion. LAINEY gives her father a kiss and departs. ELAINE, in the garden, overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>

(from the car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I didn't get her back in time.

	Hey, Vik.

INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room. Despite the eighty degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file. Viktor's face falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Forever".
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There aren't any. If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy. She considers herself an... "instrument".
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?

Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.

	Well, something has to be done about this budget. It's completely unrealistic.

(referring to a column in the budget)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You allowed nothing for limousine service.

	She was in the theater? When? Where?

</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll send you her resume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al least a contingency for wardrobe. Any woman can go up a dress size.

</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There isn't one.

</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine. Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work. She wants all the money up there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gazing into space)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which accounts for your percentage.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do I get to meet this dream?

</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not today. She's learning her lines.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing to Elaine's budget)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.

EXT. ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE's demeanor softens. She speaks to VIKTOR quietly, sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(correcting herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second ex-wife. You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful. We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Experience, Viktor. I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them. I'm worried about you, that's all. This woman -- she controls your destiny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone does not control my destiny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, I have a feeling. One of my feelings. There's something about her I don't trust.

VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL, LOTUS, MAC and three other CAST MEMBERS. A preliminary poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how delighted I am to have this wonderful cast assembled for "Eternity Forever". Thank you all. Now, a reminder -- as a condition for working on this film, you will not be rehearsing with Simone, shooting with Simone and you are forbidden from contacting Simone in any way at any time, whatsoever.

	I don't have much to say except that I know it's going to be a great project, if we all just trust Mr. Taransky's vision. Always do what Mr. Taransky says. If in doubt, do it the Taransky way.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage. A young cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart, tentatively approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Taransky...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<VIKTOR>

(referring to the stage)

</VIKTOR>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's not too much trouble. Could you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitant about broaching the subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This last year I was... going through some things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head at the memory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awful, awful... things. But when I saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she did... in the scene in the fireworks factory...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(face lighting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... suddenly everything made sense. My friends, family, doctors -- nobody could reach me -- but Simone, she really... spoke to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll be happy to sign it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A green set. Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green. A FULL CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively crossing the green expanse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward. Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut! Cut!... Cut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Hal freezes. VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and confronts Hal on the green floor.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hal, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene! He has to touch her. He has to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she's right there! I must feel her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling to find an excuse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's... a wall between you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- No. No. A real wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(describing a wall with
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	his hands within the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
green space)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ran right through it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did the wall get there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago. Let's move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever". He works on her close up.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes welling with tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wild flower, but that flower only grows --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes. Viktor brings up a menu and chooses from a range of "EMOTIONAL OPTIONS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOY: elated. jubilant. giddy. ecstatic. inebriated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SADNESS: melancholy. tearful. weeping. blubbering. Kevorkian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEAR: anxious. frightened. petrified. loss of bladder. control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTEMPLATION: reflective. thoughtful. meditative. stoic. bored out of her skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INNOCENCE: chaste. virtuous. angelic. Madonna. (Blessed Virgin.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SENSUALITY: seductive. lustful. bestial. Madonna. (Like A Virgin.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take it down a notch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What you don't understand --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Simone freezes again. Viktor make another adjustment.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it. But still too big.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(making a correction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smaller teardrops next time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not working. It's not alive. Let's try it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
She repeats the line. Viktor mimes the performance.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(teardrops arriving on cue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wild flower, but that flower only grows on the edge...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dramatic pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... of a very high cliff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Simone FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect, Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only sorry you still have to work with flesh and blood for the time being -- as user friendly as you are, even I can't manufacture an entire cast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
"To Vivian. Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity shot. He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen -- she is waiting patiently, as usual.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are going to have to change our plans, Simone -- you have no idea what an affect your performance is having on people. We can't stop now. There's too much to say -- these films they speak, they speak to the human condition. We're changing lives. No, revealing the truth now would be too cruel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(searching for more justification)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, when you're seeking a greater truth -- in the work -- you are not so concerned with the lesser truths along the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Simone doesn't appear convinced.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<VIKTOR>

(irritated at her pricking his conscience)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk. It's worth it. Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding her tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think we've done enough for today. You've been cooped up in there too long. How about you and me go out on the town? They're expecting us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to a copy of "The Echo". A photo of Viktor at the gate of his Malibu home. "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight". Viktor puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an opulent hotel. He approached the CONCIERGE.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm checking in a special guest...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(obviously conspiratorial)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Miss Enomis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy of "Variety". Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails To Three Picture Deal".
</DIRECTION>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Enomis, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Enomis demands her privacy. You will switch off all surveillance cameras. I will escort Miss Enomis to her room alone via the rear exit. She will require no help with her luggage. She does not wish to be disturbed at any time for any reason. She will be departing for a function tonight at eight sharp.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tipping him with a hundred dollar bill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I can rely on your discretion. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
(passing the key to Viktor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCIERGE>
<DIRECTION>
As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card to the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Concierge picks up his phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR enters the hotel suite. We see a montage of scenes -- Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny rocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
H) VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and scatters it on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I) VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush bouncing into the toilet bowl. He retrieves it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J) VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the rear entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K) VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size shadow on the drapes. A "walking" silhouette is visible to the media on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
L) VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I LOVE YOU V--".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door. He looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(peering through the peephole)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>

Viktor smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head. A HOTEL DOORMAN keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's limousine waits at the curb. The coated woman starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>

(scrutinizing the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's "Matinee"? There they are. Okay, I think everyone's here. Now!

Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car, providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the paparazzi.

The car door slams shut as the pack descends. MAX SAYER and MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters. The limo screeches away. A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone following.

The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.

INT. MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE. His assistant, MILTON, begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for fingerprints, etc. Max rubs pencil into the impression on the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of life is that it ends".
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting Milton's work)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me for a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Milton and the Concierge depart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max is alone. He looks around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) MAX enters the bathroom. He picks up a drinking glass and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places it in a plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips before placing it in a plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) MAX enters the bedroom. He carefully removes a slip from a pillow. He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same sheets recently vacated by Viktor.

INT. VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI in their wake. Viktor gently removes the coat from over her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not Simone. FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy. Viktor and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the limousine.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(not quite able to avert
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God for you, Faith. I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in. You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAITH>
<DIRECTION>
Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their intimate position.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely followed by FAITH on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous. Viktor hardly resists. In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith murmurs in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>

As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".

INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY. As usual, they are mesmerized by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE. The scene ends. The light go up.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.

</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not that. I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor is shocked, busted. He covers it with a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(ashen-faced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wondered if you'd spot that. You've got a good eye, Lainey. I'm proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got them to remove the reflection. The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>

(sarcastic, annoyed at the suggestion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else? It's always Simone's idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(not quite convinced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?

Both look to Lainey. From inside the car Lainey watches her parents.

	Yes. To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to tell her myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cajoling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are you going to let me meet her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon. Soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone you know is lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before. However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera shutter from a nearby bush.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how you can stop that. She has to get out more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(climbing into the car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the premiere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PREMIERE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET". Red carpet, klieg lights searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out. The crowd screams with excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor waves. Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open car door... but nothing. The door shuts. A disappointed murmer. The limo drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
</DIRECTION>
<PREMIERE_REPORTER_1>
<DIRECTION>
(talking to camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What a night! Anyone who's anyone is here at the premiere of "Eternity Forever," but waiting for Simone to show may take even longer. We do have her director, Viktor Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ushering him over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREMIERE_REPORTER_1>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly irritated by the focus on the star)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Other reporters force their way into the interview.
</DIRECTION>
<PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope she does show up. Some of her fans got here at dawn. We don't want to disappoint them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(through a pained smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm sure they're going to love the movie. I got the inspiration --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
</DIRECTION>
<PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HARRY EPSON!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor. Screen idol, HARRY EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry! Harry! Can we have a minute? What brings you here tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(waving to the fans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly irritated by the invasion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
<DIRECTION>
(believing she has a scoop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREMIERE_REPORTER_2>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you people! No wonder she never comes to these things!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A packed, glitzy party. VIKTOR enters without an escort. Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT, schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MOVER_SHAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine! The picture is a revelation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOVER_SHAKER>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I mean, it was a team effort --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small pocket camera. Elaine is unaware of the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor picks up a drink from the bar. A DRUNK WOMAN, perched unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack Daniels. She accidentally brushes one of her discarded glasses off the bar. Viktor catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder. HAL stands there accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(oblivious to his sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody said she was here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass lipstick-smeared.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, that's her glass!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(impulsively smelling "Simone's" glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack Daniels, straight-up. She is my kind of woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(looking anxiously around the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAC>
<DIRECTION>
(dawning on him, glancing
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to the far side of the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
packed room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies Room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(unable to resist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously looking to the restroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to talk to her about my experimental film. It's very... experimental.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that her? -- By the fountain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle, her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(testy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring him, calling out to the woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SIMONE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear. They talk over each other.
</DIRECTION>
<GUEST_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Simone's here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUEST_1>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly the worse for drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- When did she arrive? Why didn't someone tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<GUEST_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUEST_2>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She's by the fountain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<GUEST_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Simone, over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUEST_3>
<GUEST_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Simone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUEST_4>
<DIRECTION>
The rumor races through the party like wild-fire. The GUESTS surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOKALIKE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOKALIKE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She gets knocked into the fountain. Several other GUESTS also fall in the stampede.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts his station. Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCAL TV NEWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced with ambulances. PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
</DIRECTION>
<ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(into microphone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Forget "Eternity Forever", the big news tonight was the surprise appearance of Simone. Even these seen-it-all superstars are apparently not immune to Simone fever and the resulting stampede forced organizers to bring the event to an early end. I spoke with some of the departing guests about their encounter with Hollywood's most reluctant superstar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENTERTAINMENT_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.

	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_3>
<MALE_GUEST_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I can't reveal what we spoke about. It was... personal. Simone and I go back a long way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_GUEST_1>
<FEMALE_GUEST_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- When she talks to you, for that moment, you are the only other human being in the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_GUEST_1>
<FEMALE_GUEST_2>
<DIRECTION>
(dress torn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I really don't know what the fuss is about. So over-rated. She's done one film. Talk to me when she's had the kind of career I've had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_GUEST_2>
<MALE_GUEST_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I do expect her to be nominated, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_GUEST_2>

We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.

INT. ECHO OFFICES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated. He paces back and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She goes to a major, Hollywood, A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment, we don't even get a photograph? Is that what you're telling me?

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Confidential" FBI
	</DIALOGUE>

report)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias. She never stays in the same place two nights in a row. Anything on the satellite photos?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the fingerprints? What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.

<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILTON>
<MAX>

(interest piqued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which means they're significant.

	Incriminating.

	Perhaps, criminal.

<DIRECTION>
Max ponders the revelation.

	Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure. You know I had something on Mother Teresa. But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the headline on the cover of The ECHO. VIKTOR is reading the magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his soundstage. A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is trying to break into the "CLOSED SET". VIKTOR runs towards the door, throwing himself between the door and the executives.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You can't go in there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!

</ELAINE>

Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Why? What's all this about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
<DIRECTION>
(waving a spreadsheet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever".

<EXECUTIVE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- They're in the toilet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_3>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She has to get out there and sell the film.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What do you want her to do, go door-to-door -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she was alive today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her. I told you, she's only about the work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<EXECUTIVE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- This is over-shadowing the work!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_3>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
<DIRECTION>
(waving the front page of The Echo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the problem. She's more famous for her no-shows than her shows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to squeeze past Viktor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't handle her, I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(blocking her path)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now. She's emotional. Her mother dies today. Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing". It's not a good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower Viktor.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Please, don't go in there!

</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.

INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the vast soundstage. A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>

Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I can explain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear. I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's into computers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding in agreement)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the one place she can be herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<EXECUTIVE_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anonymous.

</EXECUTIVE_3>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(adopting a serious tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's worse than you think. She's extremely agoraphobic -- has a morbid fear of people and germs. In a way I'm relieved you... found out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, you should have said something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't want pity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing a new side of Viktor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so good to protect her like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor shrugs modestly.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Executives, conceding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what. I know how much this means to you. I'll try to get her to plug the film.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try. Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.

</VIKTOR>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We understand. Thank you, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give her our best.

<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the soundstage.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_1>
<DIRECTION>
(aside to a colleague)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That agoraphobia -- it's like a plague.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_1>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's out of control in Europe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to introduce you to Simone at the premiere. There wasn't time with the riot and everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up a framed photo from the work station)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she wanted you to have this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said you were very beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>

	Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?

	Oh, yes. Of course. Don't I always?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE"! Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX SAYER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV. However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart. She wears sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf. Simone takes a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of cereal off a display.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ECHO OFFICES - DAY

MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured. He rewinds the tape and replays the moment.

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too. Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism? We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.

ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's mansion with eager anticipation.

<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK from The ECHO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a final test of his equipment. When he touches his hair, bats his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind SIMONE from a library of images. Rainforest. Desert. Ritzy hotel suite. Moonscape. Factory.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make up your mind, Viktor. Make up your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>

He settles on the desert location.

He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe -- selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy to say she's agreed to join us tonight from the set of her new film.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to the TV monitor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>

LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look. She gets up and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio, Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide locations --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone. Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures frighteningly convincing.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(from TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't I know it. That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't secretly want the attention?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies. How is that healthy for a performer?
	</DIALOGUE>

IE. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to look through a book.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(from TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real. Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>

TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change of topic. Simone, you've been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press -- Mick Jagger, Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro... and most recently Viktor Taransky. Is there a Mr. Right in there somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather not discuss my private life.

	But Viktor and I are inseparable.

ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.

</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command. SIMONE'S EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like a moment, Simone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Where would you like to start?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about the nudity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank. For me, clothes are just an option.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(unable to resist a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods sagely.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're better for it if I may say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking alert:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
!!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up. Curiously, it is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we appear to be experiencing satellite difficulties. In case we lose you, Simone, I want to thank you --

</FRANK_BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank... YOU, FRANK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug. The feed goes blank on Frank Brand's screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion. Since SIMONE is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated Simone also slumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's cell phone rings. Viktor picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR_SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hel--
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR_SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice synthesizer.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
An anxious beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you and Simone...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(blurting it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... getting married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(taken aback by the suggestion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, of course not!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	significance of the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Would you care if we were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(covering, realizing she has given herself away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quick change of topic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And touching. She was spectacular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you do...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, tonight was a good start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me? Start?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine hangs up. Lainey approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully broaching the subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, do you miss Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(she thinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes. But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever. He took the credit for Simone tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the Nietzsche book in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Dad deserves more credit than he gets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen. He is unusually anxious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as she awaits instructions on the screen. For some reason Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Simone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you cover yourself up!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He hits a button. A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple desert. MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why she left you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILTON>
<DIRECTION>
Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND interview. He compares her desert location to the one in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing out a Joshua tree)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, that's the exact same tree and in the distance, there's the...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice trailing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... mountain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILTON>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILTON>
<DIRECTION>
Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man publicity machine. The floor is littered with photographs of SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular Mechanics".
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We don't do the photo shoot, you don't get the cover... written answers to written questions, that's right... website interviews, no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION". Choosing from a HULA DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. She begins to dance for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources. With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want exposure, Elaine? I'll give you over-exposure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE watches TV in her office. She cannot change channels without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic answers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think "Eternity Forever" is my finest work.

INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY FOREVER" costume. He speaks to the photo.

<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy Meals. Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure in a convertible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!

Screams the banner headline in "Variety".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly at Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A banner in a window reads. "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR FASHION". Mannequins model the clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly appears on the screen along with photographs of the artists --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN, CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc. Beneath the title of each song is a graphic representation of the music -- "PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor presses a button: "MORPH". The audio waves converge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also sings. The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECORD STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside the record store. TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me" shoots up the Billboard charts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OCEAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a luxury yacht.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last a moment to savor his success. Simone's hit single plays on the yacht's stereo. He looks at peace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARINA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph taken. However, we discover that the Simone is only a lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell snapshots. He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and ELVIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice boat, Taransky.

Viktor freezes.

	Got your attention now?

Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the photographs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's bogus. You used an old library shot for the background.

<VIKTOR>

(ashen)

	<DIALOGUE>
	The background is.

</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was never in New Mexico. She never left the studio.

Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking the background.

</VIKTOR>
<MAX>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(afterthought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail. But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts. I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.

	I'm keeping it in trust.

<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abduction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it? What is it -- drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control? All three? What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?

Viktor flinches at the remark.

<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it exactly you want, Sayer?

INT. CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast, empty stadium. On the stage, a lone microphone. VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena. Several PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
</DIRECTION>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All ready, Mr. Taransky. This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of a packed house. We could have sold it out twenty times.

Viktor nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TECHNICIAN>

	Soundcheck went perfect. Laser show ready to go.

	After what you told us about the death threats, the security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd.

</PROMOTER>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>

Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a kiss.

	Simone wanted you to have these.

EXT. STADIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck. The control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... SI-MONE! SI-MONE! SI-MONE!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour. NO ENTRY".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck. On his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... SI-MONE! SI-MONE! SI-MONE!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMONE appears on the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get you into hair and make up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints across the lids.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wardrobe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes appearing to fabricate themselves on her body. He settles for the most provocative outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor showing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands, stomping their feet and chanting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easier to make one hundred thousand believe than just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the "ENTER" key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke fills the stage. A strobe light show plays. A booming ANNOUNCER is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present, live on stage, for the debut concert of the "Splendid Isolation" tour, the one, the only, SI-MONE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage. However, on closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam creating a hologram. Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid the illusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by the enormous video screens on either side of the stage. The CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that they are watching a pre-recorded event. Some watch the event on portable TVs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP on the computer screen. VIKTOR scrolls down a list of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(from on stage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
He selects "L.A.".
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd roars its approval.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's great to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS -- begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me". A verse of the song is sung in perfect Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters aloft. For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry -- the grand illusionist. Viktor is at the height of his powers.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to the image of Simone on his screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about you, Simone, but I've never felt more alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone stand.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER. His journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept up in the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMONE finishes her final number.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>

	Good-night. Never stop believing.

</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars. FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE BOYS. Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour" T-shirts and carry posters. Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a TV NEWS CREW.
</DIRECTION>
<FAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I swear, she looked right at me.

<FAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FAN_3>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chanting crowd can be heard exiting. VIKTOR, wearing lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with Simone's signature kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is interrupted by a knock at the door. Viktor irritably opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I didn't want to be interrupt --

ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a SECURITY GUARD nearby.

Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's lying down. She's exhausted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor is confused by their reaction. Elaine yanks Lainey away.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank Simone for the tickets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(calling back as she is led away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a great show, Dad...

<DIRECTION>
Viktor waves disconcertedly.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you... going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the trailer door. He slams the side of the trailer in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re- runs of the SIMONE concert. KENT cannot take his eyes off the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously, this can't last. She's going to dump him. Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive. It'll destroy him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENT>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(not hearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Kent switches off the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<KENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been meaning to talk to you.

Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring at the breaking waves. LAINEY joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Lainey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently teasing her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's your love life?

</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do okay. How about you?

</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know me -- married to my work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noticed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now. She broke up with Kent.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Too bad.

	She thinks you're with Simone.

</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner, maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A phone call?

</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>

	Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.

	I'll see what I can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	You know, Lainey. I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone. Don't you like her?

</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor is confused.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? So I can tell my friends at school -- as if that validates my life somehow. What's Simone going to say to a fourteen-year-old anyhow? She's going to be polite because you're my father but we're not suddenly going to become friends -- we have nothing in common. It's not going to be real. Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in my head every day. Why kill the dream? What do they say, "don't get too close to your idols, they always disappoint you".
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than her years.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>

<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.

EXT. LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car radio. ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Her car phone rings. She turns down the radio and picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>

</ELAINE>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine looks to the inside lane. SIMONE, wearing sunglasses, phone to her ear, drives alongside. Simone waves, somewhat mechanically. Elaine waves back. They keep driving as they talk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road ahead. He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late. I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about. I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go. I owe Viktor everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he owes more to you. But that's not important now. I know what's going on between you two.

</ELAINE>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>

	I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(rueful smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone. I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.

(breaking character)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

(correcting himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at the last second.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, are you alright, Simone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- I --

<DIRECTION>
(regaining control)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship. We could never be anything else. We're just so... different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have a daughter together. I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.

(joking weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only make love to the camera.

	Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.

Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve to avoid him.

</ELAINE>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's car swerves to the right. Elaine looks back in her rearview mirror, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the truck in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the fender-bender. However, the Patrolman is more interested in the Simone mannequin.
</DIRECTION>
<PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to explain. I know what the press is like. Lunatics. Out of control.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the Simone mannequin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do know I'm going to have to take this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE". ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best Actress" envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the winner is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he reads the name.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, there's a tie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(milking the moment for all it's worth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The winners are... Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their applause.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(big smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and Simone for "Eternity Forever".
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
The audience erupts. Viktor accepts the congratulations of those around him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, Simone can't be with us tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But thanks to the miracle of modern technology she is able to join us live via satellite from the location of her new film.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
The screen flickers to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland location chosen by Viktor.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you! Thank you! This means so much to me. I'm just sorry I can't be there with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wiping away a tear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First off I have to acknowledge my fellow nominees -- I don't even feel I belong in the best actress category let alone with these... wonderful human beings.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(composing herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I also have to thank my co-stars, the studio, of course. But most of all, I have to thank the audience for supporting what I do -- you're the only reason I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
The CROWD applauds wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAINEY is puzzled. She leans over to Viktor.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't she thank you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She did... didn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(crestfallen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him. The blood drains from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the speech.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And of course I must thank my collaborator, Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen. He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's written right there... Why didn't I say it?... How could I forget to say it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Simone stares back at him blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door. The front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At Oscars".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home. MAX is standing outside next to his car.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside the car, MILTON closeby. Viktor stops at the gate and reluctantly exits his car.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now, Sayer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(smug smile, noticing
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor noticing the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
woman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks familiar, doesn't she? No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I traced her to a nursing home. A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She looks a lot like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(undeterred)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in front of the old lady.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to Simone's picture, catatonic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My baby... My baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(putting his hand on his heart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would think that "Saint Simone" would abandon her own mother? I've been looking into the family history -- heartbreaking. Most likely a biography to run over four issues... who knows, maybe there's a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in front of the old lady.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to Viktor's face on the driver's license)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My baby... My baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(sensing an opportunity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That won't be necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pretending to be resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max. You got me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking Viktor aside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we speak off the record? I'm a fair man. I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Thanks. Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You love her, don't you, Max?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(writes a check, hands it to Max)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should take care of Mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor drives into his home. Max, very confused, stares at the old lady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his soundstage. He removes the blindfold. From Lainey's point- of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(taking in the car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fantastic -- it's too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Thank her for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(disappointed by her reaction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's from both of us. Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey averts her gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I can't accept it. I don't want a car, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(clearly hurt, not understanding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? I can get you something else. What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The old Viktor Taransky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally blurting it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked you better before -- before all this. You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity. I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her. And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go again, blaming yourself. Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you. You deserve better than Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hasty exit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to go, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lainey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's remarks. JANE enters.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready for your casting session?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor nods distractedly. Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicola's here for the role of Simone's sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly uncomfortable by Viktor's scrutiny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(numb)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike & Ike candy, including cherry.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. It's not important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look. She really inspired me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor continues to stare.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the script in her hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like me to read?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'd like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(her angry words are in
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	opposition to her amorous
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
actions)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Who do you think you are, Carlos -- coming in here like this? With my husband sleeping in the next room. Do you think I won't call out? Do you think I will just give in to you without a fight -- like the last time and the time before that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she kisses his ear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she kisses his lips)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish we were both dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Nicola immediately breaks character.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(finally able to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you're really very good. I take back what I said. I mean, you're really good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(forgetting himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could play the lead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's Simone's part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gazing at her face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you have a line here. Not a wrinkle. Actually, more of a dimple. I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to do it again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor does not reply. Nicola quietly leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via satellite. However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar Ceremony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Old home video of ELAINE. She is in a garden by a swimming pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a kiss to the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor freezes the tape. Elaine appears particularly beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs it into Simone. Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same dazzling smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle as she talks on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Oh sure, she comes in all the time... we've become close. She told me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR enters the office.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jane hurriedly hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up a pile of scripts from the in-tray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm leaving early tonight. If you need me I'll be at the beach house having dinner with a... certain someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jane tries to conceal her interest. As soon as Viktor exits the office, JANE picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone, under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Elaine Christian please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music. The doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks himself in the mirror. In the reflection, he spies an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELAINE stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elaine, it's Wednesday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning absent mindedness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it Wednesday? It's Wednesday. How embarrassing. I don't know what I was thinking. With all the excitement lately...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(peering past him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I interrupting something? Are you expecting company?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(ushering her inside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter-of-fact I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When is she coming over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing to his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About now. Would you like a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine takes a seat on the sofa. Viktor hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her -- close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both apparently in need of courage.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to make conversation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Simone back to earth yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(blurting out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she really having your baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(instantly regretting the remark)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just read somewhere --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I know. They'll say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(making to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should be going, she'll be here soon --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She already is. Simone's not coming over, Elaine. Not tonight, not ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you back, Elaine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(melting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you back too, Viktor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss. Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with doubt.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is crazy. Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone. What woman can?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would rather have you than Simone. Believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meeting his gaze)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's strange. I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, there isn't. There's nothing to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Viktor. You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you'd go back to her. What man wouldn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't understand. She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she will. Her public will demand it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if I don't let her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mustering all his nerve)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone is not a real person. I invented her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(misinterpreting his remark)

	Every actor is an invention, Viktor. Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone. But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.

</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows? She certainly doesn't need you. Some people even say you're holding her back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who says that -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking off the insult)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Never mind. You have to listen to me, Elaine. Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation. I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --

<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much wine have you had?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- She's a figment of my own imagination. I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're drunker than I thought. Are you doing that again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me! Me! I swear, as God is my judge. You don't know what I've been through. Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(producing his spectacles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think I've been wearing these? I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why? To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a final explanation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see? I made Simone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. His words hang in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You made Simone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a trace of pity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viktor, she made you.

Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor alone in his house.

INT. VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office. Suddenly, he stops and confronts the standee of SIMONE.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bitch! I'll destroy you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
JANE stares in shock. She discreetly exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at SIMONE. He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house, VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash. Max finds a beat up reel of 16mm film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a compromising position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line, overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Disgusting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_1>
<WOMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
(sympathetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She must have been so desperate to do something like that, so depraved.

</WOMAN_2>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm still naming my baby after her.
	</DIALOGUE>

</WOMAN_2>
<WOMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor blanches. It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging for muddy vegetables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into spontaneous applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<FILM_CRITIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Simone to do something as brave as "I AM PIG" at this point in her career, with so much to lose -- all I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am Oscar".
	</DIALOGUE>
</FILM_CRITIC>
<DIRECTION>
E) In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds wrinkles to Simone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote on a TV screen. However, her squeaky-clean image has gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking during the interview. The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simone, that's a rather controversial position.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOST>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just think all elementary schools should have a firing range -- so students can learn how to defend themselves. We could fit it inbetween recess and American History.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>

Another clip:
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Immigration?! God, isn't it crowded enough?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<HOSTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as we always knew. Simone's not like other celebrities. She speaks her mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOSTS>
<DIRECTION>
G) VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his brakes, almost causing an accident. He stares numbly up at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE. It reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's trying to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An inscription on a headstone reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK ALENO, Remembered Virtually Forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave. He places a bunch of flowers there.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the flowers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're plastic, Hank. I know that's the way you'd want it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing to a Simone
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	billboard outside the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
cemetery wall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She killed you, Hank. Now she's killing me. She's a serial killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ducking out of sight of
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the billboard as if
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Simone is watching him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't know how to stop her. She's taken on a life of her own. I can't just come clean -- make some confession. I've defrauded millions -- they'd turn on me. And I can't put the genie back in the bottle. If she stopped working -- dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest. I've tried to kill her career but they like her even more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I going to do, Hank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A thought occurs to Viktor. He slowly rises from behind Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say another word, Hank. You are truly a genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, SIMONE's face full screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time he puts his words in her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE_VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, Viktor? You look so sad. Don't you love me anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE_VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the only way, Simone. If it's any consolation, you're going to live on in the public's heart like all the other tragic figures that went before their time. There's no love like posthumous love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're thinking. It's a phoney-baloney world. The women are surgically enhanced, the athletes are on steroids, the singers are lip-syncing if they're even singing at all, the news is entertainment, the politicians are bought and paid for -- we're living one big lie. So why shouldn't you live too? You're more authentic than the people who adore you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a trace of despair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's the problem. You're looking at the real fraud. I told myself this was all about the work but if that was the truth, it wouldn't matter to me -- and it does. It wasn't that the artists had no respect for the art. They had no respect for me. Someone like you, you have so much love showered on you -- I just wanted to feel one tiny drop on my face. I'm sorry, Simone. Here I've been trying to convince the world that you exist, but I was really trying to convince them that I exist. It's not that you aren't human, Simone, it's that I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver. 8.1". He places the disc in the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor sees that Simone is crying. He touches a tear on his own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses "ENTER". The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen like dust. Finally, the dust is blown away in a single digital breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on his own desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software. He shuts the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing. A mournful pause -- then he heaves it over the side. The trunk sinks like a stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS. A somber VIKTOR enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is my sad and solemn duty to announce the tragic passing of Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A gasp from the audience. Then, an explosion of anguish.

At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON. They are frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) The announcement of her death appears on local TV news shows around the globe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property including the driveway. VIKTOR insensitively drives over the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX SAYER and MILTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd around a television showing a live picture of Simone's funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the studio lot. Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto the hearse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) The same television picture is playing on a television sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river. LOCAL WOMEN stop washing their clothes to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an island in a lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS from the studio. Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Elaine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified by the suggestion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you bring that up at a time like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum. A PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor. He nods and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid. The coffin lid is pulled back. Inside is a life-sized cardboard standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MOURNERS gasp. Everyone looks to Viktor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault on the standee.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I heard him say, "Die bitch".
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
A) MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- He was a controlling madman, she was a prisoner. I blame myself... I should have done more to stop it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
B) NICOLA gives a statement.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It was strange. He wanted to replace her with me in his new movie... and I know I'm not that good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE. Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots, interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls, stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and television appearances.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky. I'm just trying to understand. All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to various items)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You understand perfectly. I will confess to fraud, not murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to oversize mail bags)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. The fan club is real. But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(patronizing smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky? I refer, of course, to Edith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being interviewed.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woman you admitted to a journalist is Simone's mother and for whose silence you paid a fortune? Is she not flesh to you -- are her tears not wet?
	</DIALOGUE>

The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone through the window.

The Detective abruptly lowers the blind. Viktor rolls his eyes at the Detective's theatrics. He is suddenly enraged.

	She's insane! This whole thing is insane! There is no Simone. Look!

VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his yacht.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question. Altered, of course. Is that really what you expect us to believe, Mr. Taransky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The Detective freezes the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?

	Why don't you just come clean, Viktor? Tell the truth. You'll feel better afterwards.

VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE and his LAWYER. DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk. Viktor's face lights up.
</DIRECTION>

The trunk is winched aboard. However, as it lowers onto the deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar. All eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted. Apart from a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't. I mean, it feels like I have. I know more about her than members of my own family. She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet. I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence. Have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(unable to refute it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to shake the notion from her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey finally tries another file. She presses "EJECT". The "PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(regarding the disc)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one part of dad's story that may have been true. Simone may have contracted a virus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lainey smiles at her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<LAINEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certain viruses can be cured.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething, while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.
</DIRECTION>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed tones, referring
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to a thick Psychiatric
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Report)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Listen, I've found a psychiatrist in Ventura -- well respected -- who's willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce, ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- No! I can't go along with this horseshit! Just tell them they can fry me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(aghast, looking around to see if anyone has heard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAWYER>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing! I strangled her! I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire! I did it! I killed her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (clearing his throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The Lawyer spins around guiltily. The Detective stands outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd better see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the cell. VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
</DIRECTION>
<VBC_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
(from TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Breaking news -- international media star, Simone, is alive and well. Her studio released this footage only minutes ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VBC_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times -- headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE" and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE, on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever. She winks to the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<VBC_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Simone reading today's edition of the L.A. Times. Who says, "The only bad publicity is your obituary"? Details at the top of the hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VBC_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
The TV is switched off. Viktor stares at the screen, trying to take it in.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're indestructible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding the cell door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head in pity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never get you Hollywood people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a sea for VIKTOR, released from custody. One placard reads, "ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW". He is escorted to a waiting limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY. He hugs them both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE. LAINEY sits opposite, studying her laptop computer. Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(relaxing back into his seat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lainey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how you did it but thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting her arm around him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding Viktor close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(meeting her gaze)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lainey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(beaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About you and mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctant admission)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me and Simone. What I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
(sweet smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy. We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAINEY>
<DIRECTION>
Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually forces its way through the reporters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob. Max has hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the window --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE". Viktor looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing him on the cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(still staring out of the window, a rueful smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... it's life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who appears as usual on a television monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time. Viktor bought me that time. I owe him so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly returning to Simone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles coyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true. I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<FRANK_BRAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what may I ask brought this on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_BRAND>
<DIRECTION>
SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose this little man had something to do with it. Viktor and I are both concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning lovingly to Viktor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you, Viktor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMONE>
<DIRECTION>
On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(turning lovingly to Simone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded. VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there -- he is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCERT STADIUM - NIGHT

DURING THE CLOSING CREDITS SIMONE PERFORMS ANOTHER SONG FROM HER CONCERT TOUR -- "(YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE) A NATURAL WOMAN".
