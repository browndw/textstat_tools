EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make one more move and you'll both be staying late for the rest of the week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<THE_BOYS>
<DIRECTION>
(softly; in unison)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BOYS>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't hear you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<THE_BOYS>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BOYS>
<DIRECTION>
Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking place around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
(used to this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step away from the curb, children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... This incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late again, Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be no excuse for tardiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He starts sobbing softly into his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, stop that... Children, on the bus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling despite herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER_MARY_FRANCIS>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... Think it over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus out of the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top of their lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - RICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(over mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't all calm down I'm gonna drive this thing over a cliff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The kids pay no attention to him.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; philosophically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah... youth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his engine. Rick counters by gunning his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out." "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out money and start betting one another on the race's outcome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - RICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he readies for action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BUSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky school buses filled with kids can be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two buses come zooming down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICK'S BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to control the inevitable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BUSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They race down a steep hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE OTHER BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something hits with a splat against the windshield that resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE OTHER BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICK'S BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage a victorious cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one- year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... and watch the birdie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
O'NEILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These should be in the mail to you by next Friday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes settle onto her full breasts. These he likes.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Look at those babies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
She gets this innuendo and loves it.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Klupner.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Mrs.?

</O_NEILL>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm separated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were you, I'd breast feed until I was 17 or 18.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gets behind camera; sizing up the shot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell ya what...
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH CAMERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the baby sitting on the blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you lean into the picture with your child?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
She coyly leans INTO FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A-huh. A little more... good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'NEILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out from behind the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(seductively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the Woman finish her last button.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now lean in a little more... more... more...
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
As she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold that pose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
O'NEILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH CAMERA LENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to breast. Etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps into the shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH CAMERA LENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman gets bored and EXITS the FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd she go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
O'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... be right with ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
RICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up some photographs of today's work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - PHOTOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each one has a different mother in several seductive poses. Their babies are barely visible, if at all.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pictures a family will cherish forever.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHULO'S AUTO SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop. Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill hop out.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chulo, where are you, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic of Mexican ancestry.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you guys, what's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right into traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; to Rick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick's got an important announcement to make.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've decided not to run for President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter. Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten feet into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another employee is washing down the garage with a hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the hood of a car.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Manuel, be sure and finish up the electrical system on that Chevy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME, we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain. There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo, Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ, wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot, which is a definite overcompensation for his size and inability to deal with the opposite sex.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling; into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he hangs up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and they start for the door. Just then the PHONE RINGS. Gary picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you... That's crap... Suck my...

He hangs up the phone and they start for the door again.

EXT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a couple of very contemporary looking 15-year-olds going into a very "now" clothing store -- like Fred Segal's... When the door opens, loud ROCK 'N ROLL MUSIC blasts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving narcissistically to the music like they're at a disco. The cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. Today she's in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as she sways lost in the ozone to the music. A CUSTOMER approaches her with a purchase.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to pay for these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<PHOEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till this song is over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOEBE>
<DIRECTION>
She floats off again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive salesgirl. This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and has a clear sense of herself. She can also take a joke, thus her engagement to Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, where can I try on these pants?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
She leads the Customer to the try-on booths. The Customer enters one. We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his underwear is exposed to the world. We PULL BACK, REVEALING other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they are much too busy dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy- looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is O'Neill's girl and Debbie's best friend... She's also someone who would party every night if given half a chance.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.

<PHOEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening?

</PHOEBE>
<BOBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie's marrying Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBIE>
<PHOEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Really?

<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<PHOEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohmygod.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOEBE>
<DIRECTION>
The girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in sheer joy. A MALE CUSTOMER, moved by this outpouring of affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls, enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Customer; realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you get out of here.

Reluctantly the guy retreats back to the Calvin Klein jeans rack.

	Does Cole know about this?

<PHOEBE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really -- you went with him for two years.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.

<BOBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBIE>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.

(oblivious)

	I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.

	Deb, I want to throw you a shower.

INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen / living room. He has about five dishes going at once as he dashes from stove to refrigerator. He grabs some hamburger meat, rolls it into a ball, then slaps it on the counter. He then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs him tightly, kissing him sweetly.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>

	God, you're a slob.

</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we having?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.

<DIRECTION>
(looking at the stove)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think your dinner's burning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rick crosses to the stove. A small fire is coming out of one of the frying pans. He douses it with water.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have a bachelor party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you think?

</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks awful.

	Not in this case, however.

	Are you going to have women at your party?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.

	I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.

</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, those. Why do you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.

Rick grabs her; starts kissing her passionately on the neck.

	Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo man. No painted lady ever gonna come between us.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you got it. I got a way we can seal the deal -- what'd you say?

He grabs her. They kiss and slide down onto the table, knocking the dishes to the floor.

EXT. BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward the house, she sees something off in the distance that startles her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEBBIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side door of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DEBBIE

	Cole?... Cole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
DEBBIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Bear" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact, dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is definitely unsavory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF FRAME. The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS of TAXIDERMY.)
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Deb. Just got back from the mountains.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he cuts in with a surgeon's skill)
</DIRECTION>

	Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna look great in the den.

Debbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing.

</DEBBIE>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(lifting an organ of some sort O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at Debbie intensely. Then he returns to his work with a renewed enthusiasm, chopping, slashing and slicing.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Angry, Deb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little nuts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, I'm sorry, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>

</DEBBIE>
<COLE>

Debbie exits and we PUSH IN ON Cole. Something on his face says, "Hi! I'm really out of my mind."

INT. DR. STAN STAHL'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. STAN is Rick's older brother and a proctologist. Although he's only in his early thirties, he thinks and acts like someone in their early 70's. A little on the pompous side, Stan is never without his pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Rick, hold out your arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the needle cautiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I changed my mind. I don't need a blood test. The marriage is off. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Stan sticks the needle in his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STAN>
<DIRECTION>
(without much conviction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stan removes the needle and hands Rick a cotton ball.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STAN>
<DIRECTION>
(returning to this world)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they go out into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say anything to my wife about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
They pass an open examining room. Stan's wife, TINA, is also a doctor and is examining an old man. She's not as tiny as her name suggests. In face, she's more like over-sized.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Tina.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick moves to hug her and he notices that Tina has her finger up the old guy's ass.

EXT. DEBBIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie and Rick and her MOM and DAD are having a frustrating game of tennis behind her parents' plush home. Mr. Thomerson is a stockily-built guy in his fifties who prides himself on being tough and competitive. His wife loves to shop. As far as she's concerned, appearances are everything. Neither of them likes Rick's appearance or anything else about their future son-in-law. Mr. Thomerson slams the ball to Rick; Rick slams the ball back and drives it over the fence, out of the court.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops!

Mr. Thomerson serves the ball to Debbie, who hits it over the net to her mother, who hits it to Rick, who slams it over the fence, out of the court. Mr. Thomerson does not look pleased.

<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
	</DIALOGUE>

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't I just maim it a little?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<MRS_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Let's at least finish the set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>

Rick starts humming the "ABC Wide World of Sports" theme loudly. Mr. T. gives him a disgusted look and serves the ball. Rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence, out of the court.

EXT. THE THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>

A middle-aged COUPLE are sitting on some lawn furniture trying to read the newspaper. A tennis ball comes down from the sky and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head. PULL OUT to REVEAL that they're surrounded by dozens of tennis balls.

</RICK>
<MR_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting on his anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Thomerson, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T., and the lemons bounding over the fence.

The bluff overlooks the ocean. It's a beautiful spot. Just the right setting for an outdoor wedding. Some folding chairs have been set up and a canvas canopy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gathered for the rehearsal are Gary, Ryko, Chulo, O'Neill who is with Bobbie, Debbie's mother and Mr. Thomerson, Phoebe, Ilene, Tina, Stan, a gray-haired priest. FATHER FALWELL and, of course, Rick and Debbie. Everyone is admiring this picturesque setting. Everyone but Mr. Thomerson. He's very underjoyed at the sight of Rick and his friends. Mr. and Mrs. Thomerson are standing with Father Falwell. They are watching Rick holding Debbie.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If everyone would take their positions...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FALWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone takes their places for the wedding procession. The wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force. As Father Falwell opens his Bible, the wind rips the pages out of the Holy Book. They blow to the four corners of the Earth.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear. Well, let's begin. And...

</FATHER_FALWELL>

He hums the Wedding March. Chulo hums along. His humming is a driving Jimi Hendrix-like guitar lick that all but drowns out Father's humming.

He's orchestrating the proceedings.

RICK

He begins to walk toward the priest. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Cole appears at his side.

Gary turns, almost collides with a garbage can, and starts walking down the street. He passes a parked Porsche. After a beat, Cole Whittier sticks his head up and watches Gary walk off. Then he hops out of his car and approaches Jumbo and the girls.

WIDEN TO INCLUDE the MANAGER. All their carrying-on stops when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a hotel manager, he'd be a mortician. He has a constant expression on his face that suggests he's constantly sucking lemons.

Debbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall. Margot and Darlene stand amidst the girls. Darlene plugs in her device. She and Margot start to embrace and fondle one another. The girls watch in stony silence. Dumbfounded at what they see. Margot and Darlene start to sink to the floor, OUT OF OUR SIGHT. Before they disappear, we see Margot take out her gum and park it on an end table. Now OUT OF SIGHT, the girls watch for a beat. Then we hear the WHIRRING of Darlene's implement. Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one another in a protective clump.

Everyone pelts Rick and O'Neill with more junk.

Suddenly the door bursts open. The guys look up and are surprised to see Cole enter.

Rick gestures to Chulo to look out the window.

<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... real nice. Ah, excuse me. I'll be right back.

</COLE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
All the guys treat this as if it's "Let's Make A Deal". They take sides, yelling out, "Take the car," "Keep Debbie." Over the din we hear a befuddled Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a decision here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the window. Cole follows closely. He's trying to convince Rick to take the car.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GARY>
<JUMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.

</JUMBO>
<DIRECTION>
Gary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives Jumbo his money.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>

	This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.

	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>

On the way to the table they pass MICHAEL, the bartender, who looks at them and immediately recognizes Debbie. Finding this interesting, he picks up a phone and dials.

NICK

He holds the tray with one hand. With the other he reaches OUT OF FRAME. In a nutshell, what he does is place his honker in the hot dog bun. As he slaps his business into the bun, we HEAR a solid THUMP.

Mrs. T. grabs the hot dog. It won't come off the tray. She yanks harder. Nick drops the tray and Mrs. T. finally comes to realize what she is pulling on. She screams in terror. Because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop Nick's schlong from her grip. The rest of our ladies look to see Mrs. T. 's hot dog. They scream in shock. Debbie spits out her marguerita, hitting Phoebe in the face.

The PIMP turns around and we SEE he is the stereotypical pimp. One big difference: he's an Indian straight from the streets of Calcutta. He's soft-spoken and ever smiling and he still hasn't quite mastered English.

MILT joins them. Milt is a massive hulk. A bearded exbiker. He could have come out of an MX silo. A menacing mountain of a man decked out in a cowboy hat.

<RAJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This being Milt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Milt casually takes off his hat and immediately sticks his face through a nearby window, smashing it to pieces. He pulls his head out, smiles and puts his hat back on.

<DIRECTION>
The guys are piling back out of the bus into the hotel. The Manager watches them suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick, O'Neill, Ryko and Stan come back into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned; calling O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Larry! Yo, Larry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick crosses to the bathroom door, opens it and goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry is on his knees on the side of the tub with his head submerged fully under several inches of water.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Larry comes out of the water. He gasps for breath and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm killing myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath and submerges his head again. Rick unplugs the tub and it begins to drain.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Larry... you've got to lighten up. You and the wife can work it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The water has drained from the tub, leaving Larry high and dry. He lifts his head out of the tub. In his state, he's unaware that the water is gone. He gasps for air as Rick holds him up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Larry takes a deep breath and plunges his head into the tub. His head hits the waterless tub bottom with a loud THUD. He goes limp from the concussion. His body drapes into the tub, head first.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Larry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks after Larry, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ain't all right.

ANGLE - THE LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL THE ADJOINING PHONE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The receiver is off the hook. After a beat, Mr. T. crosses to the phone. Cole does not see him, and vice versa.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_T>

<COLE>

</COLE>
<MR_T>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. How's everything going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_T>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.

</MR_THOMERSON>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Looking over into the next booth, he sees Thomerson's back.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, tell the asshole to shut up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, I'm talking here.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the phone down and EXITS SCREEN RIGHT. Cole starts to exit left when he spots Chulo getting into the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, your car's looking good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<COLE>

</COLE>
<CHULO>

</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors slam shut. Cole races out into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole comes bursting out into the street. We can tell by his shocked expression he doesn't like what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS as he charges to his Porsche. His pride and joy has now, thanks to Chulo, been customized into a Chicano special. It's chopped and channeled; dingleberries rim the back window, flames have been painted on the rear fender; a chain steering wheel, fuzzy dashboard, dice hanging from the mirror. A real East L.A. beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - COLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's snapped -- totally flipped. He turns and yells up to the hotel:
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>

</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the window and sees Cole standing next to his transformed Porsche.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.

</COLE>
<RICK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<COLE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE STREET

Cole hops in his car and drives off, blowing his HORN at oncoming traffic. The HORN PLAYS "LA CUCURACHA." Cole slams his fist on the steering wheel in disgust.

He grabs Rick by the arm and leads him out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick is finishing giving the food order to a WAITER. In the b.g. we SEE O'Neill talking to a BELLHOP. The Bellhop is pointing to a table. O'Neill thanks him and slips him some money.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...couple more on rye. Lots of fries... and a burger and diet soda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Waiter acknowledges he's got it and exits. O'Neill joins Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
O'Neill leads Rick to the table the Bellhop pointed out. They sit down. Immediately O'Neill takes some cash from his pocket and holds it under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huddled underneath the table, hidden by the tablecloth, is a HOOKER. Her specialty is coming right up. She grabs the bills from O'Neill's hand. She tucks the money in her cleavage and turns her talents to Rick. She unzips his fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reacts to the ZIP SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is that?

	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The best table in the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>

The Hooker has begun to do what she does best. And Rick loves it.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I think we can skip the wine list. Oh, gee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
FATHER FALWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters the restaurant. He spots Rick and O'Neill and crosses to them.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FALWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boys, good evening to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FALWELL>
<DIRECTION>
Rick tries to maintain his dignity. But from under the table a blue ribbon job is being applied to his fun zone.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father Falwell, good evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
Falwell shakes Rick's hand. Rick hangs on for dear life. Pumping the hand up and down at a faster and faster rate.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father... Oh, yes... yes... yesssss... Oh, yesssssss!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Falwell pries his hand loose.

<FATHER_FALWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Rick, soon you will be a married man. How does it feel?

Rick's excitement heightens as the Hooker pulls out all stops.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooooooh, Jesus, Oh God, God, God, God, Oh Jesus, Jeeeesussss...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Father Falwell looks on rather perplexed. Rick sees Falwell's puzzled look.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just saying grace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>

</FATHER_FALWELL>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You done?

<DIRECTION>
Before Rick can speak we HEAR a VOICE from under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<HOOKER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOOKER>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's hand EXITS FRAME and zips up his pants. Then Rick and O'Neill get up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, would you like to take our table?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
O'Neill can't believe what Rick is about to do.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_FALWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_FALWELL>
<DIRECTION>
He sits in Rick's spot. Rick leans on the table to say his final farewell to the priest. He takes this moment to get some money out of his pocket and hold it under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hooker grabs the money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'll enjoy this table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long, Father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
He and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He doesn't know what the hell is happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE
</DIRECTION>

Rick and O'Neill enter the suite. No one is there.

Everyone jumps out from their hiding places. With our guys is Gary and his team of FIVE PROSTITUTES.

One of our hookers, KELLEY, gets everyone's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's first, guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone acts as if they're in grade school. They raise their hands; they come on like kids trying to get the teacher's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<GUYS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, me... me... me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUYS>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. The guest of honor should be first.

</O_NEILL>

	Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead off. I'll screw clean up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at the layout.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>

Chulo enters. He sees the party has taken off.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have returned!

He spots a sweet-faced young hooker, LAVERNE. She is prancing around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; points to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! Mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
Laverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her. Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo gives chase.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant, still in her bra and panties. FIVE other LADIES are dressed in their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage. Laverne, seeking the safety of the moment, stands in line with the contestants.

INT. HOTEL SUITE

The party is taking off. The all-girl band is going ape shit. The guys are dancing with the hookers. They're all moving in unison, to a gyrating New Wave dance step and singing along with the MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - RYKO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's wearing gravity boots, hanging upside down, entwined around one of the hookers. They're hanging there, making out like crazy. Gary passes by.

</STAN>
<RICK>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.

</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Stan pats Rick on the back and dives into the festivities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - GARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots someone across the room. It's like Tony spotting Maria for the first time in "West Side Story." As in a DREAM SEQUENCE, ALL SOUNDS STOP. Two pinspots hit them. She turns and sees him. She smiles. Both are madly in love. Like two pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet, they walk toward each other.
</DIRECTION>

	Hi.

INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON LARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LARRY>

<GARY>

Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his dress and turns to Gary.

Tracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions later.

</LAVERNE>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<LAVERNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good question. From the way I understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. That's why I think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. That way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery.

INT. BANQUET ROOM - BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chulo and Laverne are standing in the wings while in the b.g. we can SEE the MC singing the Moosehead Beer jingle. Then:

</MC>
<CHULO>

<DIRECTION>
Laverne squeals with delight and hugs the MC as he puts the bejeweled crown on her head. Then the MC leads her to the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<LAVERNE>
<DIRECTION>
(teary-eyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe it. This is the happiest day of my life, and I owe it all to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAVERNE>
<DIRECTION>
She points O.S. to Chulo, Chulo, with tears in his eyes, comes out on stage and, in a surge of emotion, picks Laverne up off her feet and hugs her passionately.

The other judge looks at Mr. Thomerson suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES IN TO a car in the parking lot which is towing a U-Haul trailer behind it. The car stops and turns off its lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stan and O'Neill sit in the car looking at the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?

</STAN>
<RYKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</RYKO>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.

</RYKO>
<STAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the "Moose" from the beauty pageant steps outside the hotel for a smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear. After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the trailer with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the "Moose" by a rope.
</DIRECTION>
<RYKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you believe how perfect it fits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYKO>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you guys...
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's your friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STAN>
<DIRECTION>
(keeping it a surprise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to moose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown excrement nestled in the shag carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The Manager crosses to them.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
All the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the elevator. The doors slam shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE AT THE DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have the boy take your bags up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells us what it is. It's the "gift" Rick left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
(to couple)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. I seem to have a hand full of potty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Revolted, he races into a room marked "MEN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - BALLROOM DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any time, Al.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in, slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked to see one another.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(nearly hysterical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1002.

</COLE>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.
	</DIALOGUE>

(disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
With a determined look, Thomerson crosses to the elevator, as Cole runs into the hotel gift shop.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick, Ryko, Stan, O'Neill enter with the "moose."

<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen... Ladies... For your viewing pleasure, meet Mike the Magical Sexual Mule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
O'Neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a real burro. The burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt to do when excited. O'Neill and Stan zip off the rest of his costume, revealing a well-endowed beast.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about this, a Trojan donkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
DESIREE, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask, comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. Desiree puts Ravel's "Bolero" on the PHONOGRAPH; then she starts to sway her hips sensuously in front of the animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE PARTY GUESTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all scream and holler approval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DESIREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rubs up against the donkey, shaking her backside against the animal's.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on the donkey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Now all eyes are on Desiree as she does an erotic striptease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE DONKEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is getting bored and a little hungry. It bends its head to the left and spots the table with food on it. It bends over and starts munching on some cole slaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DESIREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the catcalls of the partygoers, Desiree is getting all worked up, stripping down to a G-string.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DONKEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's had enough cole slaw. Now it sniffs at Larry's drug smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. Next it sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in one gigantic sniff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DESIREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts. Then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. She rolls on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - HER AUDIENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick can't believe he's seeing this. The other guys are screaming at the top of their lungs. Even Larry seems spell- bound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE DONKEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DESIREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. The donkey's blood-shot eyes are the size of saucers. Once again he shows his teeth in a kind of shit-eating grin. Desiree drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. Mike the Donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a trance-like, very turned-on state.
</DIRECTION>
<DESIREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESIREE>
<DIRECTION>
The Donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly rears up on his hind legs, snorting. He starts bucking wildly. The crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone goes rushing up to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chulo and Laverne enter the room, followed by several of the other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you guys, I'm getting married.

He looks over and sees everyone gathered around Mike.
</DIRECTION>
<CHULO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHULO>
<DIRECTION>
Gary shushes him. We PUSH IN ON Dr. Stan, who is listening for signs of life in the animal's chest. Finally Stan stands up somberly.
</DIRECTION>
<STAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drug overdose.

	Afraid so. I did everything I could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>

O'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary, Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like pallbearers at a funeral.

Mr. Thomerson, who's been standing at the door, takes this time to sneak into the suite right behind them.

Mr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making out, drinking and dancing. He hides in a corner to watch undercover.

He hangs up and crosses to the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had enough of this.

Just then the elevator door swings open. The donkey falls out into the lobby. The Manager screams in terror, as do several of the hotel guests.

Mr. Thomerson goes nose to nose with Rick.

He turns away and walks OUT OF FRAME. O'Neill crosses to Rick.

He drops to his knees and hugs Thomerson's legs. The party stops and everyone watches.

Thomerson is trying to free himself from Rick's grasp as Rick continues with his "hard luck" story.

</DIRECTION>
<O_NEILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The phone's all yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_NEILL>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which causes him to sniffle slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never liked you. I've never liked any of your friends. I've hated you from the first time I saw you. And now you are out of my life. You are out of my life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose. He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his nose and takes deep drag after deep drag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and sits down next to him on the bed. He gives her a big, wide smile.
</DIRECTION>

O'Neill closes the door.

As Debbie opens the door, her father walks by with Desiree on his arm. Neither sees the other. Debbie enters the room. She is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders with one another in the room.

PUSH IN ON Debbie. She's pissed.

INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seductively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll lead you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you get undressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in that same sappy, child-like manner of his.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a lovely day in the neighborhood. It's a lovely day, it's a beauty, would you be mine, could you be mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he's now stripped down to his underwear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Please won't you be my neighbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Mr. Rodgers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi... Hi there... Today we're going to learn about anatomy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she and Rick come face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't believe it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
She all but jumps out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't trust you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, I knew it was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding back tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, you're lying!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of the room. Rick charges after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE - MAIN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is wall to wall people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - DEBBIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to make her way to the exit, but her path is slowed by all the happy revelers.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling over the din; furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want that. I want to be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am committed. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME. She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People! Can I have your attention... people!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone stops what they're doing and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to ask you all a question. Have I had sex with anybody in this room tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
There's a negative response from the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone responds positively.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
All the guests go back to partying. Rick drops off the sofa and faces Debbie.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
(melted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sexy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get naked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
She takes him by the hand and crosses into the other bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OTHER BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick and Debbie enter. To their surprise they find a man wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking Desiree's boots, which she dangles in front of him. She also holds a whip over his head. Despite the mask, there is something very familiar about his face, and the white powder encrusted all over his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debbie picks up on this immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, Mr. Thomerson looks up and grimaces, knowing he's been caught with his bondage down. He tries to say something, but the boot in his mouth prevents anything intelligent from coming out.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_THOMERSON>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party has reached fever pitch. Suddenly police SIRENS pierce through the party sounds. Everyone freezes. We HEAR the Hotel Manager BEATING on the DOOR with his fists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Manager is pounding on the door. By his side are several UNIFORMED POLICE.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all under arrest. Open up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to everyone in the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone starts to panic and run for the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad no one is panicking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps up his clothes from the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Police)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Break it in, boys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
The cops rear back for a run at the door. At that moment the hotel door opens up and the cops and the Manager are trampled by Rick, Debbie, Mr. Thomerson, Rick's gang, other guests and assorted hookers. They run down the stairs. The cops pick themselves up and give chase. The Manager looks inside the room and is devastated by what he sees... Hiroshima looked better after the A-bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the police have collared Bobbie, Phoebe, Mrs. Thomerson and the other ladies of the shower as hooker suspects. Our bachelor party mob now charges down the stairs and out the hotel doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops grab Mr. Thomerson as he tries to get out, and they throw him in line with the others. Unfortunately for him, he's standing next to Mrs. Thomerson.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ed! What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can answer, Mrs. Thomerson checks out his shocking leather outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ed... you're kinky!

<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So have I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
He is totally blown away by this as the cops lead them out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_THOMERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen another man's diddly.

</MRS_THOMERSON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our people pile out of the hotel. Rick, Debbie and all Rick's friends run down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a Porsche pulls up between Rick and Debbie. It's Cole. He reaches over and pulls Debbie into the car with him. She screams.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cole, what the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
He drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
They all board the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PORSCHE
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICK'S BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAINTENANCE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught up with Cole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles back into the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into the theater entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out of the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fan out and look for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
They all go running into various theaters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie playing inside.
</DIRECTION>
<RYKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, I've seen this one already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYKO>
<DIRECTION>
Rick chooses a theater and goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVIE THEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. He gives chase and catches up with Cole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to LADY next to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, what a realistic effect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, like you're in the movie with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRON>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely amazing.

</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A Man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to shreds doesn't seem pleased.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUFF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding in progress. The area is adorned with flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him.
</DIRECTION>

Nearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese businessmen).

</MR_THOMERSON>

They sort of smile at each other at the thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He indicates to Rick someone has arrived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAN
