<DIRECTION>
slide past in a 400mm lens. Then, entering a plane of focus is VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit. Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit, white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming at him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left. His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a ticket in his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
right now something catches Vincent's eye. And the two men bump into each other...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO-SHOT...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay? Sorry...

</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent puts down his briefcase. The man has a similar briefcase.

<MAN>

(North London working- class accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate. Enjoy LA...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with the North London working-class accent. And continues towards the exit. Was it an accident? Was it a brush pass? The Man's accent signified nothing to us except one thing: foreign origin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaches until he's in ECU...

<DIRECTION>
OVERHEAD SHOT: VINCENT

CREDIT SEQUENCE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Images wipe across the screen, kinetic and abstract, floating and dreamlike in SLO-MO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shades of yellow. Ribbons of silver. Shimmers of chrome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights sweeping past, flaring to white. Brake lights flashing, halating red. Reflections of overhead fluorescence flowing like liquid along windshield glass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract, reverberated and discordant, bouncing off concrete walls: car doors OPENING and CLOSING. Brakes. A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Racing Forms. A Farsi newspaper. African hands on a Blackberry. Max's hands do The New York Times crossword. A West African speaks French into a cell phone. Metallica in a headset. Hip-hop, Norteno...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mechanics hands change tires, replace air cleaners, close a hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI DISPATCH - L.A. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ORANGE and YELLOW FORD CROWN VICTORIAS are wiping screen. We find ourselves in a busy garage at change of shift. A balletic convergence of arriving and departing cars. One's door's flung open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ONE CAB - MAX'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enter. They wipe the seats with paper towels and 409...a DMV LICENSE fitted into the small Lexan holder. On it is a picture of Max.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights being checked. Indicators. Hazards. Switches. Similar to a pilot doing an aircraft check list. Fast. All fine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL NOW: MAX'S BRIEFCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens it, preparing for his workday. CD caddy of personal mixes goes on a visor. Spreadsheet peaks out a worn Mercedes S500 brochure, clipped open. A submarine sandwich from Subway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG LENS: OTHER CABBIES - OTHER FACES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
load-in. Southern California diversity - some unshaven, swapping stories, counting cash, one stands on the passenger seat to shout over the roof to his pal, spills his coffee, couldn't care less...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not Max. His cab is fly. Among cabbies he is GQ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as CAR HORNS BLARE. AD LIB BANTER. CABBIES SHOUT. Max gets behind the wheel, closes the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and WHAM! The noise evaporates. Welcome silence. Max takes a moment to savor it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts the engine. RAP MUSIC BLARES from the radio. Max turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dumps a CD into the changer. MOZART SONATA fills the cab. From the open briefcase, Max also pulls out one last thing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TATTERED POSTCARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which depicts the whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine. A dream place. An endorphin-releasing groove. Limitless horizon. It's the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slips the postcard under the rubber bands on the visor. He can see it whenever he wants to. But not now. He flips the visor up, puts the car in gear and pulls out.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. LA DOWNTOWN - MAX'S CAB - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...harsh reality intrudes. Max is driving a YOUNG PROFESSIONAL COUPLE with carry-on bags, having a heated argument about...

Max endures it silently, invisible as furniture. He doesn't exist as far as his passengers are concerned...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as Max drops an elderly Asian couple in Little Saigon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, he sees a cluster of CHINESE GANGBANGERS in their early 20's wearing cheap suits, white shirts and no ties. Some guy gets pushed to the ground, punched and kicked while four or five watch, amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max's first instinct...

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, leave-up on him, man...

He throws his food container. Another throws a beer bottle. Max hits the accelerator as the bottle bounces off the rear windshield...

EXT/INT. CAB - GAS STATION - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Max hangs the nozzle back, gets in the car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max slips his credit card into the briefcase. We glimpse the Mercedes S500 catalogue again. And Max flips the visor down, staring at the island. Soothed by the blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're seeing the most private of Max's rituals, the one he doesn't share with anybody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, he starts hustling for calls by posting himself in a nearby zone. See Max work the computer. He bids and gets a next load.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yellow cylindrical stairs...a pretty young WOMAN descends into the interior lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max finishes his notation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young WOMAN detours through media and the rush-hour crowd while talking rapid fire into a cell phone, starts toward Max's cab, waving at it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max doesn't see her, starts to pull away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gives up, turns toward a green City Cab behind her, but it just picked up a load.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Max catches sight of her and stops. Red taillights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and starts for the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE Max regard her in his rearview mirror. He ejects a CD and loads a different one.

<DIRECTION>
The indicator goes GREEN. Vincent slips the card into his briefcase and walks through, towards the bank of elevators. However, he doesn't take an elevator. He walks past them towards an escalator down to the street. Why did he walk into, through and out of the lobby of the building?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONTAL CLOSE: VINCENT

and PAN RIGHT with him as he and we start a descent on the escalator from the stone foyer to the street level.

PAST VINCENT'S HEAD,

riding the "up" escalator is Annie Farrell and the group of lawyers. Vincent looks at her, appreciatively, then away.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two minutes to get onto the 101. Transition to the 110 to the 10 and exit on Normandie is four minutes. North on Normandie is five minutes. Two minutes to South Union 'cause there's roadwork. Thirteen plus one for "shit happens."

Vincent's read Max's mind. Max hadn't thought it through that far. Now that he does, reality sinks in. Annie's out of his league and he knows it.

EXT. SOUTH UNION STREET APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent draws CRISP HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILLS from his briefcase, fans them like a magic trick. Meanwhile, a car pulls up behind double-parked Max. Vincent steals a glimpse of his PC. See a real estate prospectus-looking display.

brings the car to a stop and notices Vincent's briefcase lying on the back seat. A trusting soul. Max smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely not from around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He kills the engine. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a noticeable lack of city noise. DISTANT talk radio. Spanish gospel from a Baptist church. An occasional car passes the mouth of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max trades Mozart for Beethoven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max checks his watch. Dinnertime. He turns to his battered briefcase on the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's filled with carefully arranged items. NAPKINS in the pockets. UTENSILS in the pen holders. FOIL PACKS of mayo and mustard and Thousand Island Dressing. 1.5 liter PLASTIC BOTTLE of vitamin mineral water. The well-worn Mercedes brochure for the S500. A spreadsheet, like a handwritten business plan. A large submarine sandwich wrapped in two halves. Neat note pads. Everything's in methodical order.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - VERY CLOSE PAST VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbing stairs with palm trees and downtown behind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
spreads Thousand Island on the sandwich. He glances up at the visor. He tilts it down, peering at Annie's business card, wondering what to do. Will he call her?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits a moment, fighting a wave of sadness. Unhappy with himself. With his life. His place in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
raises the sandwich to take a bite...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THE FLOOR UP PAST MAX + THE STEERING WHEEL (VFX - GRN SCRN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
up THROUGH the windshield is the twinkle of stars in the night sky. Suddenly, a dark shape from above blacks out the sky. It descends towards us. As Max takes a bite...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...WHAM! SOMETHING HUGE rocks the cab on its axles! GLASS rains down. A HEADLIGHT EXPLODES! The windshield FRACTURES! Max bounces off the ceiling. His submarine deconstructs all over the interior. His coffee spills...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and then abrupt, stunning silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What hit him. An earthquake? Max takes a dazed beat. He peers at the windshield...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DEAD FACE OF A FAT MAN STARES AT HIM. Max recoils with a yell, scrambles from the cab, heart pounding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - FROM ABOVE: CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CORPSE is angled across part of his roof and windshield in a bathrobe. There's shards of window glass from upstairs everywhere. It makes a halo around the cab.

<DIRECTION>
Max is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to see where the body came from.

Max stares at Vincent. It's sinking in. Vincent, meanwhile, has to make his decision. About Max. Kill him and find another, or...

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You - you killed him?

<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I - I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.

</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
A frozen beat. Everything's out in the open. Max realizes he's in trouble. He backs away, thinking escape...

It cruises down the street and stops in front of the apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY FANNING emerges from the car. Edged hair, an earring, sports clothes. A salesman or a player or a dealer. Forties, a face with character and some miles. And something insistent about his intent...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heads towards the entry gate, rings a buzzer. Waits a moment. Rings again. Nothing. Plus...he looks like he could kick your ass if he wanted to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a thin plastic card from an inner pocket of his jacket, jimmies the door lock...
</DIRECTION>

He knocks on the door...causing the door to swing in slightly. He glances down, sees the lock was pulled. Tensing, he fades to one side, his hand going to his holster at his hip.
</DIRECTION>

He draws a Beretta, reaches out and pushes the door all the way open...

Glass missing. He leans out. A dizzying drop. A halo of broken glass on the alley below...in the center of which is a big blank spot.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB, TRAVELING - MAX - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max winds his way through surface-street traffic, in shock, sneaking anxious glances at Vincent in back. Vincent's got the tablet PC from his briefcase, studying it. The silence is thick.

Max's hand is shaking. He lifts it off the wheel, tries to steady his fingers. Vincent diverts some attention to Max...

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pops on at the driver's window. Cop #1 glaring light into Max's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND FLASHLIGHT BEAM pops on, this from Cop #2 on the passenger side. Checking out Vincent in the back. Vincent smiles good-naturedly.

Max rolls his window down. Cop #1 leans down, and we see his face for the first time. A clean-cut blonde guy.

Max gives Vincent an "I told you so" look in the rearview mirror. Meanwhile, we HEAR dimly on the POLICE RADIO about a domestic disturbance on 83rd and Hoover and some officers responding.

Cop #2 plays his beam across the cracked windshield and damaged hood. Faint reddish traces in the paint. His smiles fades.

<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but your cab's not safe to drive. And we're going to impound it. We need to do a vehicle inventory while we wait for the tow truck. Pop the trunk and step out of the vehicle.

<DIRECTION>
(swings flashlight beam to Vincent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to phone for another cab.

Max hears a SOFT CLICK behind him. The unmistakable sound of a safety CLICKED OFF. He meets Vincent's gaze in the rearview mirror. A whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You open that trunk, they go inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Vincent, through the rear windshield, Max sees Cop #2 moving to the trunk, playing his flashlight across it...

Max, mouth dry...

</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
Max tosses a hopeless look into the rearview. Vincent's staring at him. No mercy there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max steps from the car. The cop escorts Max toward the rear, Vincent smoothly pulls his H+K from his waistband and emerges on the passenger side, gun held out of sight and a heartbeat away from opening fire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a CRACKLE OF STATIC, a PANICKY VOICE COMES OVER THE POLICE BAND:

REVEAL Vincent looking at his PC. Vincent pulls from his briefcase an identity card for a Notary Public and a second gun, a .45 Cal Para-Ordnance back up.

INT. HOTEL, PENTHOUSE - SYLVESTER CLARKE

<DIRECTION>
crosses towards the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL - ALLEY - MOVING IN ON MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances in the sideview, wondering where Vincent is, straining for a glimpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Just darkness back there... Mind racing...
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY! HEY! OVER HERE! I'M IN THE CAB! HEY! HELP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
The street traffic's distant; nobody's around.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HELP! GODDAMN IT! THERE'S A MAN WITH A GUN! HE'S GONNA KILL PEOPLE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max thrashes wildly against the duct tape, screaming with frustration. He starts head-butting the car horn...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEEEEEP! BEEP-BEEEEEEEEP! BEEEEEP! BEEP-BEEP-BEEEEEEEEEP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his head, checking the street traffic a quarter block away. No one on the sidewalk takes notice of Max's cab.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fuck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He shifts low on the seat, getting his knee under the dashboard. He slams his knee up, hitting the RED EMERGENCY LIGHT BUTTON concealed there. EMERGENCY STROBES START FLASHING at the front and rear of the car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and still nobody notices.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GODDAMN IT, I'M FLASHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE OVER HERE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He throws a look to the sideview mirror, sweaty and tense, knowing he's out of time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SIDEVIEW MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN WHICH WE SEE Max's reflected eyes. Seconds ticking breathlessly away as he struggles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He head butts the horn again. BEEP-BEEP. BEEEEP. Flashers and horn!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEANWHILE the ANGLE SHIFTS in the mirror, leaving Max's eyes and bringing into view the building and the penthouse at the top and we SEE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...TWO SILENT MUZZLE FLASHES light up the windows like flashbulbs going off. Another death. Then A THIRD FLASH...then nothing. Lights out. Meanwhile...
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He is head-butting the horn. BEEEEP. BEEP-BEEP. And he checks the mirror. This time when he looks, he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG WHITE GUYS. 20-25. They were on the sidewalk. Now they detour into the alley and approach the distressed cab from the back, shielding their eyes from Max's flashing lights.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Oh, thank God! Hey, hey, man, help me out here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WHITE_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, whassup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_GUY_1>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(fast, stumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel, here, by this guy, who's taped me in the car, 'cause he's up in the building somewhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER, now, the four are in baggies, hoodies and tattooed with lightning bolts on their necks, swastikas on chests, one has "5150" tattooed on his shaven eyebrow (police code for emotionally disturbed)...
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_GUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all trapped in there and shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_GUY_2>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...yeah, he's coming back. Hurry. Get me loose so I can call the cops...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE GUY #1 nods...and pulls a chromed .380 and points it at Max.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck that, man, gimme your wallet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_GUY_1>
<DIRECTION>
The others have walked off down the alley, laughing. One tosses a beer bottle that smashes. Utter disbelief from Max...
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WHITE_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will fuck you up! Hand it over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_GUY_1>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hands are taped to the damn steering wheel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment for WHITE GUY #1 to process this. He steps to the window, presses the .380 against Max's cheek. It's utterly terrifying, everything happening fast:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...don't shoot me, don't shoot me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<WHITE_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then get your ass up, up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_GUY_1>
<DIRECTION>
Max pulls himself up by the steering wheel, trying to get his butt off the seat to give the Young Man access. The White Guy #1 gropes for Max's back pocket, trying to get the wallet, pressing the gun to his face, the other guys down the alley, turn the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White Guy #1 pulls Max's wallet, pockets it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and pauses, seeing Vincent's briefcase on the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks open the back door, grabs Vincent's briefcase, too, and walks off after his friends. White Guys #3 and #4 turned the corner. White Guy #2 lingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max, still taped, is shaken. He can't believe what happened. He looks through the windshield at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE GUY #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...walking off, cocky as hell, about to vanish into the night...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OF WHITE GUY #1
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo' homie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
White Guy #1 turns, to see the silhouette of Vincent. He raises his .380 side-handed, like he sees gangsters do on MTV. White Guy #2 joins him.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (even)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That my briefcase...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
White Guy #1 approaches Vincent from the front...#2 from Vincent's left.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_GUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May-be. And what the fuck else you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_GUY_2>
<DIRECTION>
He closes on Vincent with the .380, held high and on the side. Vincent's left slams aside #1's .380. Draws and FIRES from the hip, putting TWO ROUNDS into #1. HAMMERS-ON TWO ROUNDS to the sternum, pivots. ONE to the head of #2. All in 1.6 seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White Guy #2, falling backwards, is dead before he hits the ground. #1 never saw it coming. Vincent picks up his case, retrieves something from #1's pocket, puts one more into the head of #1 on the way back to the cab...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...where Max saw it all. Frozen in horror. Astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rear door opens. Vincent hefts his briefcase into the back seat. He gets into the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent sits for a moment, staring off, not looking at Max. Maybe ready to kill him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent raises something into view. Max's wallet. He tosses it in Max's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent flicks his hand. CLICK-CLACK, a Reeves folding hunter in dull metal, razor sharp...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the button? Under the dash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(dry whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent leans over and slices the plastic tie, freeing Max's hands. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind turning it off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Max doesn't move for a moment, then reaches under the dash and turns off the strobes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - MAX + VINCENT (TRAVELING) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent in the back seat. (Juxtapose to a different continuity. Through the side window, we see Crenshaw Boulevard barbershops, music shops. We're stopped for a light.) Max is shell-shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another collateral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Collateral damage. People in the wrong place at the wrong time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meets Max's gaze)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you? You attract attention? You are gonna get people killed who didn't need to be. Understand?

race by. WIDEN. SEE Max filling up the taxi. Vincent is positioned off the right rear corner from where he is line-of- sight to everything. His affect is flat, distant. Max has witnessed violent death and the full, lethal capabilities of Vincent. Neither say a word...until softly...
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vincent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Max?

</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I collateral?

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. A long one.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't decided.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Max is silent. Absorbing this. Vincent checks his watch. Unexpectedly, his mood changes up.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, hey! New news. We are ahead of schedule.
	</DIALOGUE>

</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jazz.

	Not that much.

</MAX>
<VINCENT>

<DIRECTION>
(off Max's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy you a drink. Expand your horizons...

Max doesn't get Vincent's mood up-change.

EXT. SOUTH UNION APARTMENT BUILDING, ALLEY - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COPS and FORENSIC TECHNICIANS. In the midst of it all is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray Fanning. He wears his badge, visibly, now. We find him turning as his superior, RICHARD WEIDNER, 50-ish, is entering the crime scene.
</DIRECTION>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this informant of yours, what's his name, Ramone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ramone Gallardo. Supposed to take him for a drink. I come here, find this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You been working him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four months...a low-level player, he's been feeding me stuff on Felix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reyes-Torrena? Forget Felix. Feds are all over that. They don't want us anywhere near it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when is the LAPD working for the Feeb?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, Ramone flew out a window. My C.I. flew out a window, he's got Felix's handprints on his ass. Yes? That makes it ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<WEIDNER>
<DIRECTION>
(as if to a child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the homicide, Ray? Where's a body? All we got is glass...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<DIRECTION>
He spreads his hands at the alley floor in a gesture that says "show me something besides glass."
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_CRIMINALIST>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And blood...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FEMALE_CRIMINALIST>
<DIRECTION>
A FEMALE CRIMINALIST (SID) examines the alley floor with Luminol and a handheld BLACKLIGHT WAND, picking out dark patterns.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_CRIMINALIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...small splatter patterns here...all over there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_CRIMINALIST>
<DIRECTION>
SHINING FLASHLIGHTS pick out blood on the alley wall. Fanning steps to where the cab was parked, stands in the middle of the blank spot surrounded by the glass, points down:
</DIRECTION>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ramone flew out the window. Went splat. Here's the glass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then some tires rolled over it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that spell homicide? Maybe he jumped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. He's depressed. So he jumps four stories out a window onto his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimics)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Wow, that feels better!" Picks himself up. "Now, I think I'll go on with the rest of my day..."

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (from above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray! Catch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLAINCLOTHES_COP>
<DIRECTION>
Two uniformed cops have approached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Weidner and Fanning glance up. A PLAINCLOTHES COP is leaning out of Ramone's broken window, dangling a clear plastic baggy. He drops it. It comes sailing down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...right into Fanning's grasp. He glances down at it, shows it to Weidner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON WEIDNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...revealing two spent .45 cal. shell casings in the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<WEIDNER>
<DIRECTION>
(switches)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, who's got what? Any witnesses? We been knocking on doors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old guy across the street, lives above the deli? Says he saw a cab parked here earlier tonight. There were two guys working under the hood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Description. What did he see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Kinda" saw...guy's got glasses like coke bottles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he "see" it or did his seeing eye dog see it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<COP_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Late-model four-door Ford. Yellow or orange.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Fanning's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it was a taxi cab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four thousand taxis in LA County.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<DIRECTION>
That's it. Uniforms go back to work. Photographer shows. He doesn't know what to shoot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Fanning, lost in thought...
</DIRECTION>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember fall, 2001? That Bay Area deal? Oakland. Cabbie drove around all night. Killed three people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he flipped out, put the gun to his head. So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the Oakland PD detective, whatshisname, never bought it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<WEIDNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEIDNER>
<FANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Cabbie had no criminal record. No history of mental illness. Pops three people, then himself? And the victims weren't random. Two were involved in some pharmaceuticals scam...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Weidner's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, the detective always thought there was somebody else in that cab.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. "DANIEL'S" JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and elegant - in an early '60's modern jazz kind of way with a low ceiling, small tables, leatherette booths, history soaked into the walls. A BLACK MAN in his late 50's, DANIEL, is playing a muted trumpet on stage with a QUARTET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUSTOMERS are few, clustered at small tables or at a few curved leather booths. The walls are lined with great FRAMED PHOTOS of jazz icons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one table, we find Vincent and Max. Vincent about the music...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a little '60's, early Miles thing happening...

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	There's people...ten years from now? Same job, same place, same shit. Everything the same; keepin' it safe. Over and over and over and over...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIMECUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and we find Daniel sharing more than a few drinks with Vincent and Max, the place almost closed. Just the three of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I was a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables. Right here. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in. Mr. Louis Armstrong.

<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was in town playing two gigs a night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel... After his last set, he decides to come on down to South Central to hang with his people. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot who we was. Money and fame an' all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. So before you know it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it great? Better than great, it had to be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did better'n that.

Vincent gives him a questioning look. Daniel smiles, raises his hands, mimes blowing a trumpet.

	How'd you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you think? You ain't shit when you playing next to Louis Armstrong. But, Dippermouth, he was kind. He could see me trying. He carried my ass as best he could.

</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>

</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whipped dog?

</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whipped dog on a wet night.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The crowd was most kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was born in 1945, but that was the moment of my conception. Right here in the used-to-be crowded room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel picks up the bottle to freshen up their drinks...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crowds not here now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, jazz ain't the draw it used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the place looks great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only 'cause I got the wherewithal to finance keepin' it up on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a great story. I'll tell the folks in Culiacan and Bogota that story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
...and Daniel's hand freezes just as he's about to pour. He glances up at Vincent.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the people in Culiacan and Bogota?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Fraid so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Max is glancing from one to the other, unsure what's going on. Realizing it isn't good.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I thought you were such a cool guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am a cool guy. With a job I was hired to do. You know how it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
There's genuine regret in Vincent's tone. Max feels his heart pounding, but manages to keep his voice steady:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go, Vincent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm working here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Improvisation? That's funny from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks about it, looks to Daniel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jazz question. You get it right, we roll. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I know you'll keep your word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel looks to Max. Hope, fear, and desperation in the older man's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. He hasn't lied...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel absorbs this, looks back to Vincent.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Means you're a man who lives on reputation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will take your word. And I will give you mine. If I walk out of here tonight, I'd go so far away, it'd be just like I was dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent nods. We have a deal. He eases something from his waistband. Max knows. His heart is in his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one more thing. Those guys and their man, here, what's his name, Felix?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them, if by some chance I get this wrong...you tell them I had to. They laid a grant of immunity on me. So it was flip and play ball or go back inside. I ain't goin' back inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel pours himself that drink. He lifts his shot glass, hand trembling slightly, knocks it back. Sets the glass down.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simple. What was Louis' first musical instrument?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know all there is to know about Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's have it.

</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(blurts out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a trumpet! Wasn't it? Wasn't it a trumpet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DANIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coronet. Bought it from a New Orleans pawnshop when he was a kid. Cost him five dollars. Got a two- dollar advance on his salary from a fine Jewish family he worked for, saved up the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANIEL>
<DIRECTION>
A frozen moment. An endless pause. Max not even breathing, staring at Vincent, waiting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a beat of regret...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Vincent's gun came up so fast, Max didn't even see it. THREE SMALL POPS. A different gun: .22 caliber Ruger with a thick, silent barrel. Three small holes. And Daniel's head falls forward. Vincent catches it, arranges Daniel's arms so that Daniel's head rests on them as if he's taking a nap. And Vincent did it gently, almost regretfully. A red mist of blood swirls in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max is stunned beyond words, and powder-burned at such close range.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence now. No one's noticed. The waitress was in the kitchen. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tin horn. Cost him a dime. Rode the junk wagon and played for the neighborhood. People sold them stuff. Rags. Bottles. Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
Max sits frozen, unable to move...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.

</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</MAX>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you mean, no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm done. Find another cab.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max turns, walking away. Vincent blinks at him, almost laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm collateral anyway, so do it and stop making me a part of this!

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wanna know you!

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent grabs the back of his collar, slams him against the wall. Max's neck is a centimeter from breaking. Their faces are inches apart.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(low, threatening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not playing.

Vincent spins Max, controls him, as he propels him to the cab, slams him against the fender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent releases him, points at him. Don't move. He reaches into the cab, pulls out the radio mike, clicks it on.
</DIRECTION>

<VINCENT>

INT. HOSPITAL - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Stark corridors, queasy fluorescent lighting, PATIENTS and STAFF MEMBERS. A row of INJURED PEOPLE are seated along one wall, waiting for attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AUTOMATIC DOORS swing open. Max and Vincent enter, the briefcase held at Vincent's side. As they enter and proceed up the corridor...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay three paces in front of me and one to my left...
	</DIALOGUE>

Max, seeing the innocent people along the walls, complies. Vincent sees in the ceiling a security camera mounted in a Perspex hemisphere and averts his face towards Max...

Vincent puts his hand out, stopping the doors. A MAN slides in the elevator with them...

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and turns around. Detective Ray Fanning. He doesn't see Max in the back corner. His back is to him.

	Five. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANNING>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent hits the button. The doors close.

The three of them ride up in that awkward silence you only ever experience with strangers in elevators. He glances to Vincent at the control panel, nods.

This catches Vincent slightly off guard. He glances to Max.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Client? I like to think of myself as his friend. A mentor.

He turns to find Max gone. He looks down, eyes widening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So is the briefcase. Vincent races out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and spins around, frantically trying to see where Max went. Nothing but a FEW PATIENTS and HOSPITAL STAFF...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and a door marked "STAIRS" swinging shut at the end of the hallway. He runs in that direction...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent bursts through the door into the stairwell, hearing RUNNING FOOTSTEPS below. He peers over the railing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and sees Max three flights down. Max freezes, looking up, clutching the briefcase. A moment of eye contact...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop or I'll go back and kill her.

</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH MAX

	But my children do. They are still small. But do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus? His helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter. There's an old Mexican tale that tells of how Santa Claus got so very busy looking out for the good children that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children. So he hired Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children, and Pedro would come every night to check them out. And the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were not saying their prayers, Pedro would leave a little wooden donkey on their windows. And he would come back and if the children were still misbehaving, he would take them away and nobody would ever see them again. Now, if I am Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do you think jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office and said, 'I lost the list.'? How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa Claus would get?!

INT. CLUB FEVER - VINCENT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
propels Max past a bar, through screens of glass, frosted alcoves...jammed with people.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Booth towards the back. That's where he hangs. Fat Korean guy. Terminal acne as a youth. You go first. Fifteen feet in front and three to my left. Wander, and innocent bystanders get the first rounds. Clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
It's all black lacquer and frosted glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back rooms - in Korean luxo - are for karaoke or the Korean hotties who hang by a counter, like a check-in area. Panels of glass in semi-circles in front of planting, some with sheets of water running down, separate the different zones. OR...it's cheesy disco with flat screens playing Korean music videos and stock market quotes with out-of-date Christmas decorations and black-lit outer-space murals. Visually, it's as noisy as the Korean hip-hop, which makes it impossible for anybody to hear anything.

EXT. FRONT OF CLUB FEVER - FANNING + WEIDNER - NIGHT

INT. FEVER - CLOSE: VINCENT

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDROSA + THE FEDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enter up the stairs. Staying as discrete as possible while urgent, while Pedrosa shoots looks, his POVs, Feds move south along east wall into densest part of the club...searching for "Vincent," trying to spot him before he can assassinate Peter Yip, searching for Yip, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB ENTRANCE - PACO, RUBIO + TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enter. They hang at the rear. Wait. Their job is to take out "Vincent" if it looks like there's trouble, a double-takeout, because "Vincent" must not fall into the hands of the FBI. He knows too much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDROSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
searches, desperately, for Peter Yip, his last witness, to get him to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FANNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters, scanning the crowd. Nothing. He and Weidner split-up. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
deeper among the dancers, now SEES distantly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER YIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
for a moment. He's located towards the back wall across the dance floor in a booth on a raised area in the semi-circular room. With him are too-young Korean girls and a heavyset Rapper. The view got blocked by an African-American and a Korean bodyguard in suits near the booth, facing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the booth are five or six Korean gangsters. But on the dance floor, itself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT SPOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
an outer perimeter of security. Bodyguards within the crowd, facing outward from the booth...looking for trouble before it gets to the row of booths and Peter Yip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
receives the glance from Vincent. He's gestured down the middle of the dance floor towards the rear. They work their way through the mass of bodies. Meanwhile, Vincent casually smiles at a girl and takes an oblique path, sliding along a convex side wall. Vincent's path brings Vincent up behind Bodyguard #1, who looks to the right as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODYGUARD #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pounded in the kidney. His head is twisted around and torn back, dropping him to the floor amid the bodies and noise. Vincent's focus is already on BODYGUARD #2, as he kicks down with ferocious force, slamming Bodyguard #1 into unconsciousness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bodyguard #2 intuits, turns. Vincent's foot slams his knee sideways, breaking it, Vincent's palm bounces the man's forehead back, his fist slams into his exposed neck, that fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
buffeted by dancers, saw, backs away, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODYGUARD #3
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
saw the assault on #2. He grabs for Vincent...who breaks the grab, pulls Bodyguard #3's head and neck down towards him, slams his knee into his rib cage twice, breaking things, spins the man backwards, rips his head sideways and back, a centimeter from breaking, and holding it there with his left arm, Vincent's right hand is filled with the H+K as he moves towards Peter Yip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PEDROSA,

AND WITH THE FIRST GUNSHOT, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE...

MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drops to the floor. Rounds are fired at him by Yip's Bodyguard #5. A dancer is hit.

HEAVY KOREAN GANGSTER, ALSO...

slams Vincent's gun hand with a short baton. Vincent's disarmed. Two Men are on him.
</DIRECTION>

A KNIFE IN VINCENT'S LEFT HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sinks into Bodyguard #1's leg, dropping him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KOREAN GANGSTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swings the baton for Vincent's head. Vincent steps inside. Traps the man's arm. Takes his baton, releases his torqued body and backhands it across the Gangster's neck. Vincent slams a forehand across his ribs. As the Korean Gangster, concussed, falls backwards, forcing Vincent to the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BODYGUARD #4,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming up the middle from Yip's booth, where attention focuses right now on the real threat: Vincent, FIRES A THREE-SHOT BURST from an SMG. And, Vincent, retrieving his H+K, rolls concussed Korean Gangster off of him, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
places FOUR SHOTS into Bodyguard #4. VINCENT'S ASSAULT WILL BE IN A STRAIGHT LINE. Now, he rolls onto one knee, FIRES TWO MORE, dropping African-American Bodyguard #5, who had two handguns blazing. And RISING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT ALMOST AT YIP'S BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korean Gangster is blown back. Another tries to help 300-pound Yip escape over the back. He's HIT. Peter Yip falls back into the banquette, his eyes wider because Vincent's coming. Vincent reloads. As his thumb hits the slide release and it jacks forward, he's already FIRED a round into Yip. And Yip's eyes - at the fierce face of death approaching - are filled in his last moments with Vincent, who FIRES four rounds. And one to the head. That fast. And the wall of frosted glass with a plane of water running down it behind dead Peter Yip is untouched, serene.

Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror. Vincent is arrested by a look in Max that he's not seen before. It's the even, confrontational look of a man with nothing to lose.

Max slams on the brakes and cranks the steering wheel hard right...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - RIGHT WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hits a low divider...rear end comes unstuck, rotating over the front right and flipping the cab into a violent roll onto its roof, spinning down the street, SMASHING off other cars, pieces falling off, spewing glass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and then settling upside-down, revolving slowly to a creaking stop, antifreeze spilling across the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then everything goes silent, motionless, still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wreckage. Steam from the ruptured radiator. Crumpled metal. Missing hood. Disintegrated windshield...shattered glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max is trapped upside-down in his seatbelt, his roof half caved in, one side of his face streaked with blood. Alive but dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Movement in the back. Sharp intake of breath. Then a voice...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. That was brilliant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
-- and a BLOODY HAND shoots from the darkness behind him, plunging an aluminum section that used to hold the perspex screen in place. Max jerks his head aside and the aluminum rail misses him by inches, ramming solidly into the headrest instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max releases his seatbelt, dropping and hitting the ceiling of the cab. Vincent, sardined in the reduced space in the back, lunges forward. Max wildly fights to keep the knife at bay and crawl out his window. We hear a POLICE SIREN. Vincent, eyes glittering, kicks out the window on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max, crawling away on the pavement, keeping low, the taxi between them, looks back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX'S POV: VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...in a glimpse, running off into the night. Vincent's hand pulls the .45 Para Ordnance backup from his waistband. Vincent's SHOES CRUNCH on broken glass. He vanishes into darkness as the SIREN GROWS near...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max pushes painfully to his feet. Looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surreal moment. Max standing by his overturned cab, the empty city all around him, breathing the cool night air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It strikes him in that moment. He's survived the night. The blood pumping through his veins is a fact. It stuns him. Overwhelms him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
How good is life?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LAPD black and white screeches to a stop. A SERGEANT gets out.

	Are you alright? What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
And the mundane beauty of the question makes Max look at him like he's crazy, and there are tears streaming down his face. The Sergeant approaches Max, gentle but firm:
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (as if to a child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been in an accident. An ambulance is on the way to help you. Do you understand what I am saying to you? Sit down on the curb. Okay?

(Max nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody else in there?

Max shakes his head. The Sergeant shines his flashlight on the passenger compartment, concerned about Max.

The Sergeant, now at the rear of the cab, to make sure there's no gasoline spill, suddenly freezes, his flashlight beam finding the trunk lid ajar from the crash, and inside is the corpse of Ramone Gallardo in a sprawled heap.

the visible grip of Vincent's .45 H+K.

Running.

Stripped of everything now. Operating purely on instinct. Vincent's gun in his right hand, handcuff dangling from his left wrist...

<DIRECTION>
Running.

<DIRECTION>
The city silent around him. The only sound is his feet hitting the pavement...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running.

<DIRECTION>
TWO COP CARS rocketing through an intersection a block or so behind him, SIRENS WAILING. Max veers for cover, not breaking stride, pressing on...

<DIRECTION>
More distant SIRENS, now, police units responding...Max, racing up the middle of the street...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing a late-night PARTIER coming out of The Standard with a CELL PHONE, Max grabbing the phone right out of his hand as he sails past him, the Partier spinning around to chase after him...
</DIRECTION>
<PARTIER>

	Hey, asshole!

</PARTIER>
<DIRECTION>
Max whips around, H+K snapping up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The man does. Max keeps running, dialing, fumbling Annie's business card from his pocket, getting the numbers wrong, trying again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and he finally stops, gasping for breath, punching in the final numbers. LOUSY signal. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND MAX TO REVEAL...

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE

Max runs up the stairs of a parking structure to get a better signal. He and we SEE...

MAX'S POV: FEDERAL BUILDING

Three floors that are completely lit, 14th through 16th.

Max hurls a steel trash can at the glass wall with all his might. It just bounces off.

Max pauses, stymied. He raises Vincent's H+K clumsily in one hand, braces himself, squeezes the trigger. Nothing. Is there a safety on this thing? He finds it.
</DIRECTION>

He tries again. FIRES TWO SHOTS into the glass door. The gun almost kicks out of his hand. But the door disintegrates. He walks through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 16TH FLOOR FILES SECTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie, frozen with indecision. What to do? Stay or go?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(In keeping with the building's design, a WALL OF GLASS separates this area from the corridor beyond, which is separated by glass from other offices and the lobby. Normally, you'd be able to see people working, walking the hallway.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right now, the corridor's dark. Terrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She forces herself to move, to cross the office, run now...for the door to the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERNAL CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but she only gets ten feet before she's stopped by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opening. A SOFT FOOTSTEP. Somebody's there. Somebody stealthy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs up, against the floor-to-ceiling windows. Frozen. Heart pounding. Listening. Against the city at night out the windows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs up, further towards the windows, back into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FILES SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...where she backs past file cabinets. Not deep enough. Nowhere to hide. So she backs along the glass. Nothing now but the CITY GLOW spilling faintly through the windows. Low shelves of legal books. Tables offering no cover. While...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tracks against the city laid out to the south, the 110 and 10 like arteries carrying white and red cells (headlights and taillights)...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNIE crouches under a table and crawls backwards. She can't hear a thing. Her heart pounds. The silence makes her want to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POV of empty, scary office. Over the table, b.g., is the glass wall running the length of the office area. The corridor beyond. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW...? Did she see a shadow pass against the murky darkness out there?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soft sound. Feet on carpet. Did she hear it? Is she imagining it? The breath catches in her throat. Eyes wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHADOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the bullpen by a corridor. It lurks, silently. Waiting. It's Vincent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONTAL: VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he moves. Softly. Quietly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the table...by the windows. A huddled form against the city lights and helicopters. Waiting. Not breathing. Still as a statue. Then the urge is too strong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's got to get out, get out now!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie on her hands and knees, trying to crawl away, soundlessly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...not realizing that walking upon her, SOUNDLESSLY, from the back is Vincent. She doesn't know. He's a shadow in the dimness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
senses. Stops. Turns...and she sees the shape - twenty feet away - of Vincent...the Para-Ordnance .45 coming up. The .45 cal barrel like a tunnel into nothingness.
</DIRECTION>

VINCENT'S EYES

He pulls her to her feet. Both of them backing away, running for the door. A GROAN. Max pulls her harder.

	Jesus, Max. You shot my ear off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his hand away, sitting on the floor, staring at the sheet of blood on his palm. He looks at the fleeing Max.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, MAX!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GLASS CORRIDORS - MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has the H+K aimed, backing for the elevator lobby...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT APPEARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
around a corner, clearing space. Fast. His Para-Ordnance up. Max and Annie running, now... Vincent sees vague shapes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM-BOOM! BOOM-BOOM! Gunshots punch through the glass, inches from Max and Annie, collapsing walls revealing Vincent against the LA-scape. Blossoms of white flame: BOOM-BOOM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and a moment later the GLASS WALL EXPLODES into the corridor, by a chair, CRASHING through it, followed by Vincent, into the elevator lobby, while...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hits the ground-floor button and "close," the doors taking a million years to do that. As they're sliding shut, he sees Vincent across the lobby, raising the gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max throws himself on Annie, both to the floor. BULLETS PUNCH through the paper-thin sheet-metal doors. But the elevator's moving now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 16TH FLOOR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...leaving Vincent behind. He darts for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Annie on the floor, breathing hard, staring at each other in wordless shock. They reach the ground floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Max drags her forward, the two of them racing across for the exit, seen WIDE + HIGH in REAR SHOT (Gas Co. lobby, running to S.E.)...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent careens down the steps, the entire side of his head bloody, his ear mostly gone. He SLAMS through a door into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where he finds the elevator standing empty. He hears a door alarm, turns, runs across the lobby...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOWER LOBBY - VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters and races down the frozen escalator to CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MTA - REAR SHOT: MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enter and run through the interior hall OR down the lower staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. MTA - LOW/WIDE ANGLE: VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
entering from the street, diagonally, down to CAM. (The office building is behind him.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOARDING PLATFORMS (GREEN LINE) - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
race towards the boarding area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hardly anyone in sight, except for an OLD WHITE HOMELESS GUY with a TV set in a shopping cart powered by a car battery.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CALL THE POLICE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at them like they're nuts. They run towards the empty platform. No train!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neon-lit, strange art, like dead people floating in a pool, hangs from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Annie run, turning this way and that, trying to decide what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER MAX + ANNIE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run down ANOTHER STAIRCASE where we see the BLUE LINE PLATFORMS, running at 90 degrees. No train there, either! They race down, anyway to get away, because...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF STAIRS TO GREEN LINE PLATFORM - REAR SHOT: VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs into frame, SEES Max and Annie 50-75 yards away, racing down the stairs to the Blue Line...a difficult shot, Vincent aims, elevates the front sight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOOM! BOOOOOM! BOOOOOM! Vincent FIRES THREE ROUNDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLUE LINE PLATFORM - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cut by .45 caliber bullets chewing craters in the ceramic tiles inches from them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLUE LINE - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEAR, NOW, A TRAIN PULL IN. BUT it's upstairs on the Green Line. They run down the platform for the stairs back UP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREEN LINE PLATFORM - VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
running, SEES the train arriving on the OPPOSITE PLATFORM. He looks down to the stairs to the Blue Line. A train pulls in there, too! Decision time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREEN LINE, THE FOURTH SUBWAY CAR - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...are discovered crawling into the car. They collapse, low on the floor, waiting for the doors to close, the train to pull out, hoping Vincent hasn't followed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has to decide, has to second-guess Max. A beat. The train sits there for seconds. It seems like hours, like fucking forever. Vincent riveted to the spot. Max + Annie praying Vincent doesn't appear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors start to close, sliding irrevocably shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he knows. With no hesitation, he leaps off the platform onto the rails as the train starts to pull out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOURTH SUBWAY CAR - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are at the sliding which adjoins the fourth car to the third car. The train's picking up speed. Where's Vincent? As a precaution, they start for the third car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MTA - HELICOPTER FROM ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...we're out of the subway on the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THIRD CAR - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
low, down the aisle of the third car, rising for the door. And Max turns and looks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing in the fourth car, staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND CAR - MAX + ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
race in as ROUNDS pound through glass into the second car. ROUNDS SLAM through metal and glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOURTH CAR - VINCENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is coming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Vincent working toward the front... Max and Annie desperately looking for cover. City racing by. Train racing by city. A few RAGGED PASSENGERS trying to huddle out of harm's way with nowhere to go. As the TRAIN THUNDERS AND SHRIEKS over the track junctures...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Annie rush in, slide the door shut. This is as far as they can go. They drop into a crouch at the door, breathing hard, terrified, Max with his back against the wall, arm stiffly keeping the door handle wedged tight, his head just below the door's window. A harsh, ragged whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the next station?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A frozen moment. Eyes locked. Knowing they're probably going to die together, even though they hardly know each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRAIN GOES BLACK, LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER JUNCTURE...then the LIGHTS RETURN, stuttering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max rises slightly up, peers over the lip of the window. Here comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX! I DO THIS FOR A LIVING!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
...and he keeps coming, .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down his face from the missing part of his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the visage of Vincent, the .45 in his hands, scares the shit out of the early-morning passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Max clutches the H+K, takes a deep, shaky breath, his eyes on Annie's, not even sure in that moment what he's going to do, probably die, and he lunges up, Vincent not ten feet away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THE TRAIN GOES DARK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLIZZARD OF MUZZLE FLASHES, both men FIRING THROUGH THE WINDOWS at each other, GLASS SHATTERING between the cars and getting sucked away by the wind, Max screaming, face lit only by the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one- handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and then abrupt silence as the LIGHTS RETURN, Max looking down, his expression nearly childlike with terror. He stares at the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back - gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, "go ahead, kill me..." through the shattered window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him. Watching Max. A little smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot Peter Yip the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in fact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max watches Vincent walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars. Slides the second door open. Enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT + MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sit there, riding the train. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're almost at the next station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent smiles faintly. He leans his head toward Max as if conferring a secret. In a halting whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Max's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think anybody'll notice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>
MAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks into Vincent's eyes. It means "I'm that guy" and "will anybody notice me when I'm gone?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans back, gazing straight ahead now. Rocking gently with the motion of the train...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man. Vincent looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN AD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine. A dream place. Limitless horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VINCENT'S CAR - MAX - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent's no longer laughing. In fact, Vincent's no longer doing anything. Ever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train pulls in to a station...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They silently get off. The first sideways streams of yellow light shaft into the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors close again. The train pulls out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HOLD ON Vincent for a while. Riding the train by himself, into the dawn, his head back as if sleeping, alone in the car, as the sun rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another dead guy on the subway...riding into a new day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Max, in his Polo shirt and dirty pants, an arm around Annie, wearing his stained sweatshirt, rises to us up the escalator...freeways, arteries of traffic behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
