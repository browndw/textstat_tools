EXT. WADSWORTH'S CAR--TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WADSWORTH's car travels through the wind of an oncoming storm. It pulls up to the gate of Hill House.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hill House is a large, imposing mansion, looking very New England.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth takes out a key and unlocks the gate. He drives the car up to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILL HOUSE--FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth exits the car, holding a bag and looking at the two barking guard dogs. The dogs approach Wadsworth...then jump. Wadsworth quickly pulls a big beef bone out of the bag and hurls it to them. The dogs trot away to gnaw on the bone as Wadsworth rolls up the bag. Wadsworth cinches their chain so it won't allow them to reach the door. He steps toward the door...and sniffs. Wadsworth pauses and checks the bottom of his feet. Dog crap. He looks in disgust at the dogs, who aren't bothered at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hall of Hill House is remarkable, elegant but not gaudy. It is furnished in dark wood, and brass, with crystal chandeliers. There are several doors on each side of the hall and three at the end. To the left: Lounge and dining room. To the right: Study, library, and billiard room. The end: Conservatory, ball room, bathroom, and kitchen. The stairs are located to the right. By the staircase is the door to the basement steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear "Shake, Rattle, and Roll" in the background. Wadsworth opens the front door of Hill House and wipes off his foot. He enters and hangs up his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSED: NEW ENGLAND 1954.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth steps briskly down the Hall steps toward the library.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--LIBRARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The library is a somewhat more comfortable room than the hall, composed of dark colors. All of the walls are covered with books, with the exception of one wall, a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YVETTE, a young and rather jiggly french maid, is polishing a glass. The music is much louder. Wadsworth enters and turns off the record player. The music stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks to the maid in a proper English accent.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything ready?

</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
She replies in a French accent.

<WADSWORTH>

Yvette nods. Wadsworth exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yvette sniffs the air, and then examines the bottom of her shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is white tile, narrow. There is a meat freezer to the right. A counter leads off to the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. HO, the cook, is sharpening a knife. Joseph McCarthy is speaking on the television in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth enters.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything all right, Mrs. Ho?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>

She turns, knife in hand.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's not my name. My name is Colonel--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
WADSWORTHme, sir, but tonight you may well feel obliged to my employer for the use of an alias.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mustard sniffs around and checks his shoe as Wadsworth hangs his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pair starts across the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>

(glances at them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Within reason, that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth exits, closing the doors behind him. The doors have books on the back of them, and so look like a part of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Wadsworth, I was--

Wadsworth removes her coat, with a brilliantly white inside. Mrs. White sniffs and checks her shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Yvette and Col. Mustard are here. Mustard is sipping Cognac and glancing at Yvette. The doors open, the left one into Col. Mustard.

(The two women react with disgust)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

A slim woman is standing by her broken down car. An owl can be heard. She hits the car, obviously frustrated. Thunder roars in the distance.

	I am, sir.

<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to mention the coincidence that you also live in Washington, D.C.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know that? Have we met before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've certainly seen you before. Although you may not have seen me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Miss Scarlet, does this mean that you live in Washington, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure do.

</SCARLET>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PEACOCK>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but you work for the United Nations. That's a government job. And the rest of us all live in a government town. Anyone here not earn their living from the government in one way or another?

Col. Mustard stands suddenly.

<MUSTARD>

(angrily, to Wadsworth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wadsworth, where's our host, and why have we been brought here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the door opening and Wadsworth speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Good evening. You are eagerly awaited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MAN>

	You lockin' me in? I'll take the key.

</MAN>
<WADSWORTH>

(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Over my dead body, sir. May I take your bag?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'll leave it here 'til I need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It contains evidence, I presume?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surprises, my friend. That's what it contains--surprises!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth enters the dining room, followed by the man.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mr. Boddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they all doin' here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eating dinner. Do sit down, Mr. Boddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
Yvette starts to serve him
</DIRECTION>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, you can take that away, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Peacock hits the table.
</DIRECTION>
<PEACOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. I demand to know what's going on. Now why have we all been dragged up to this horrible place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I believe we all received a letter. My letter says, "It will be to your advantage to be present on this date because a Mr. Boddy will bring to an end a certain long-standing confidential and painful financial liability." It is signed, "A friend."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I received a similar letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did we, didn't we.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Prof. Plum)
</DIRECTION>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I also received a letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Yvette starts to serve him again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks, Yvette. I just ate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, how did you know her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know each other.

<DIRECTION>
(puts his hand up Yvette's (short) skirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't we, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
She recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Boddy, but did your letter say the same thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I interest any of you in fruit or dessert?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case, may I suggest we adjourn to the study for coffee and brandy, at which point I believe our unknown host will reveal his intentions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--THE STUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The study is by far the most comfortable room we've seen so far. It is decorated in subdued tan colors. There are several couches, a bookshelf, a table with drinks, and a desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests enter and look around for their host.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's no one here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guests in general)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please help yourself to brandy and be seated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth goes to the desk and takes a manilla envelope. It reads For Wadsworth
</DIRECTION>
<Open_AFTER_DINNER>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I smoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<DIRECTION>
Prof. Plum, seated next to Miss Scarlet, lights her cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth opens the envelope. He peruses the contents.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm instructed to you what you all have in common with each other. Unless you would care to do the honors, Mr. Boddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why me? They know who I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. You've never identified yourself to them, I believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Boddy stands suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a hoax! I suggest we all leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off out the study door.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(in pursuit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sir, you cannot leave this house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Boddy goes to the front door. Wadsworth follows, and he is followed by the other guests.
</DIRECTION>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Who's gonna stop me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mr. Boddy tries the front door. It's locked.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the windows have bars, all the doors are locked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an outrage! You can't hold us prisoner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
The guests, in confusion, agree.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting over the din)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, please! Please return to the study. Everything will be explained.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
The guests file unhappily back into the study. Mr. Boddy walks past Wadsworth toward the rear of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mr. Boddy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, Mr. Boddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Boddy starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
He pursues Mr. Boddy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--CONSERVATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conservatory is humid, with plants all around. Three of the walls are brick, and the fourth is glass, leading to the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain can be heard and seen, against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Boddy runs in, picks up a brick and prepares to throw it through the glass. Wadsworth enters.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't get out that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? It's only glass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a vicious Doberman jumps at the glass, barking and snarling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boddy drops the brick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--THE STUDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests are already present. Wadsworth and Mr. Boddy enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth takes up his envelope again.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, you all have one thing in common. You're all being blackmailed. For some considerable time, all of you have been paying what you can afford and, in some cases, more than you can afford to someone who threatens to expose you. And none of you know who's blackmailing you, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please! I've never heard anything so ridiculous. I mean, nobody could blackmail me. My life is an open book--I've never done anything wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody else wish to deny it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
The guests look at each other, but no one responds.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well. As everyone here is in the same boat, there's no harm in my revealing some details. And my instructions are to do so. Thank you, Yvette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
The maid, so dismissed, leaves. Mr. Boddy's eyes follow her out.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think you might spare us this humiliation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Professor Plum, you were once a professor of psychiatry, specializing in helping paranoid and homicidal lunatics suffering from delusions of grandeur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but now I work for the United Nations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your work has not changed. But you don't practice medicine at the U.N. His license to practice has bee lifted, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What did he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what doctors aren't allowed to do with their lady patients?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, how disgusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(swooping down on her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you making moral judgements, Mrs. Peacock? How, then, do you justify taking bribes in return for delivering your husband Senator Peacock's vote to certain lobbyists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband is a paid consultant. There is nothing wrong with that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if it's publicly declared, perhaps. But if the payment is delivered by slipping used greenbacks in plain envelopes under the door of the men's room, how would you describe that transaction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say it stinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how would you know. When were you in that men's room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<PEACOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(standing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's a vicious lie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure we're all glad to hear that. But you've been paying blackmail for over a year now to keep that story out of the papers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Peacock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am willing to believe you. I too am being blackmailed for something I didn't do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not being blackmailed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm being blackmailed, all right. But I did what I'm being blackmailed for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<PLUM>
<DIRECTION>
(with interest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, to be perfectly frank, I run a specialized hotel and a telephone service which provide gentlemen with the company of a young lady for a short while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<PLUM>
<DIRECTION>
(very interested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling out a pen and notepad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the phone number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Scarlet rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how did you know Colonel Mustard works in Washington? Is he one of your clients?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was asking Miss Scarlet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to Scarlet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you tell him it's not true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha-hah! So it is true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A double negative!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double "negative"? You mean you have--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers to Scarlet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Photographs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds like a confession to me. In fact, the double negative has led to proof positive. I'm afraid you gave yourself away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to make me look stupid in front of the other guests?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need any help from me, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
Mustard realizes what he just said.
</DIRECTION>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But seriously, I don't see what's so terrible about Colonel Mustard visiting a house of ill fame.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puts his hand on Scarlet's leg)

	Most soldiers do, don't they?

<DIRECTION>
(standing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he holds a sensitive security post in the pentagon. And, Colonel, you drive a very expensive car for someone who lives on a colonel's pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't. I came into money during the war, when I lost my mommy and daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth is puzzled, but soon recovers.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. White, you've been paying our friend the blackmailer ever since your husband died under, shall we say, mysterious circumstances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Scarlet laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is that funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. That's why he was lying on his back. In his coffin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are you paying the blackmailer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want a scandal, do I? We had had a very humiliating public confrontation, he was deranged ... lunatic. He didn't actually seem to like me very much, he had threatened to kill me in public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would he want to kill you in public?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she meant he threatened, in public, to kill her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. And was that his final word on the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being killed is pretty final, wouldn't you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet he was the one who died, not you, Mrs. White, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he do for a living?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a scientist. Nuclear physics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was he like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was always a rather stupidly optimistic man. I mean, I'm afraid it came as a great shock to him when he died. But he was found dead at home. His head had been cut off and so had his ... you know ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
The men in the room cross their legs.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had been out all evening at the movies.

</WHITE>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you miss him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a matter of life after death. Now that he's dead, I have a life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he was your second husband. Your first husband also disappeared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that was his job. He was an illusionist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he never reappeared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<WHITE>

Mr. Green clears his throat and stands.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to wait for Wadsworth here to unmask me. I work for the state department. And I am a homosexual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth, wide-eyed, looks for Green's file. Mrs. Peacock clucks in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel no personal shame or guilt about this. But I must keep it a secret or I will lose my job on security grounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Thank you.

Mr. Green sits back down next to Prof. Plum, who rapidly stands and walks away.

<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your little secret?

</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>

Lightning crashes. Mr. Boddy looks very satisfied.

The guests advance on Mr. Boddy as he stands. Col. Mustard challenges Mr. Boddy to fight, boxing-style.

<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put 'em up!

Mr. Boddy steps on the Colonel's toes and pokes him in the eyes.

Mr. Green and the others try to separate them as Colonel Mustard recovers and Mr. Boddy goes for him.

Mrs. White decides to take matters into her own hands and knees Mr. Boddy in the crotch.

Mr. Boddy goes for the hall. Wadsworth stops them.

</BODDY>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you told, precisely?

</WHITE>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merely that you were all meeting to discuss our little ... financial arrangements. And if I did not appear, Wadsworth would be informing the police about it all. Naturally I could hardly resist putting in an appearance.

Col. Mustard opens his box and pulls out ... a heavy wrench.

Prof. Plum takes the lid off his package and looks in. He gingerly pulls out a revolver.

Finally, the camera reveals Mrs. Peacock, who is twirling a dagger.

Mr. Boddy walks on camera and continues.

Wadsworth's eyes widen in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...no one but the seven of us will ever know. He has the key to the front door, which he said would only be opened over his dead body. I suggest we take him up on that offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Boddy goes over to the light switch with deliberate ease. He closes the door to the hall and sets his drink down.
</DIRECTION>
<BODDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only way to avoid finding yourselves on the front pages is for one of you to kill Wadsworth. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODDY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns off the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear noises. Someone inhales raspily. A gunshot. Something ceramic shatters. A scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go up. Mrs. Peacock, who turned on the light, drops the dagger in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera reveals Mr. Boddy lying prone on the floor.

Mr. Boddy is turned over.

Everyone rushes for the mantel simultaneously, causing confusion.

Everyone sits but Mr. Green. He searches for a spot, but no one gives it to him. He ends up leaning against a serving table.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I said that I was Mr. Boddy's butler, this was both true and misleading. I was once his butler, but it was not his untimely death this evening that brought my employment with him to an end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did it come to an end?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When my wife decided to ... end her life. She too was being blackmailed by this odious man who now lies dead before us. He hated my wife for the same reason that he hated all of you. He believed that you were all thoroughly ... ...un-American.

Mr. Green's serving table gives way, landing him (and several pieces of crystal) on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For some reason, he felt that it was inappropriate for a senator to have a corrupt wife, for a doctor to take advantage of his patients, for a wife to emasculate her husband and ... and ... so forth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is ridiculous! If he was such a patriotic American, why didn't he just report us to the authorities?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He decided to put his information to good use and make a little money out of it. What could be more American than that?

Several nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what was your role in all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<WADSWORTH>

(Mrs. White pulls a tissue from her bra and gives it to him.)
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Mr. Boddy threatened to give my wife's name to the House Un-American Activities Committee unless she named them. She refused, and so he blackmailed her. We had no money, and the price of his silence was that we worked for him for nothing. We were slaves! Well, to make a long story short--

</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--The suicide of my wife preyed on my mind, and created a sense of injustice in me. I resolved to put Mr. Boddy behind bars. It seemed to be the best way to do it, and to free all of you from the same burden of blackmail was to get everyone face to face, confront Mr. Boddy with his crimes, and then... ...turn him over to the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, everything is explained.

The door to the freezer starts to open.

Miss Scarlet screams.

The cook's body tumbles out into Mr. Green's arms. She now has the dagger sticking out of her back. Mrs. Ho was not (and is not) a light woman. He is having difficulty holding her.

Prof. Plum is stuck on the couch between the two corpses. Rather than move, he decides to make himself comfortable.

Wadsworth starts going around the room, picking up the weapons.

	Look. We still have all these weapons. The gun, the rope, the wrench, the lead pipe. Let's put them all in this cupboard and lock it. There's a homicidal maniac about!

They both head for the exit, and they have to squeeze through-- it's a very tight fit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Col. Mustard walks past Miss Scarlet, who is sure to keep him in sight. He grabs a pool cue from the wall. She gives a little gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Col. Mustard walks over to the pool table and motions with the stick to look under it.

They do. There's nothing there.

Col. Mustard leaves.

Miss Scarlet sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to walk--slowly--toward the curtains. The curtains almost seem to be moving, but it just could be her imagination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then--there is definite movement off to the right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scarlet stops in her tracks, trying to scream but unable to.
</DIRECTION>

The hand throws the photos and papers into the fire. Then the tape goes in. It all burns.

Col. Mustard and Miss Scarlet stand in the doorway, backlit by the Hall. Rain can still be heard, but no lightning.

Col. Mustard switches on the lights. The two look around. The Conservatory is dilapidated. There is dust and cobwebs all around--it obviously hasn't been used for some time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Scarlet walks to the outer wall of windows. Rain pours down them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Col. Mustard walks to one side and picks up something. He then takes a rag and wipes his hands off. While doing so, he leans against the wall, and it swings open! He falls down, but quickly gets up.

Wadsworth springs up to the front door, the guests following closely. He proceeds to act out events.

<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(breathlessly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked you for your coat, and I recognized you as Colonel Mustard and I prevented you from telling your real name because I didn't want any of you to use any name other than your pseudonym and I introduced myself to you as a butler and I ran across the Hall to the library!

The butler rushes around the room, pointing at different locations.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Green stood here, and Mrs. Peacock here, and Miss Scarlet here, and Professor Plum here, and Colonel Mustard, and Mrs. White, and--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on with it!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting there, I'm getting there!! And Mr. Boddy went to get his surprise packages from the Hall. And you all opened your presents,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shuts the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Mr. Boddy switched out the lights!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth turns off the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are flipped back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth is lying on the floor, and the guests, tired of all this, react with disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The butler opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Boddy lay on the floor, apparently dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was dead! I examined him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why was he bashed on the head a few minutes later with a candlestick if he was dead already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I made a mistake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right! But if so, why was Mr. Boddy pretending to be dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could only be because he realized his scheme had misfired, and the gunshot was intended to kill him, not me. Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points at blood on one of Mr. Boddy's ear lobes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bullet grazed his ear. Clearly his best way of escaping death was to pretend to be dead already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So whoever grabbed the gun from me in the dark was trying to kill HIM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But remember what happened next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the door and picks up the glass from a table.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Peacock took a drink.

<DIRECTION>
(points at Prof. Plum)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said, "Maybe it's poisoned!" She screams!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth screams in falsetto. He takes Mrs. Peacock, who helpfully(?) starts to scream. The butler sits her down on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Green ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Wadsworth slaps Mrs. Peacock) (he imitates Mr. Green)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ... I had to stop her screaming ...

(back to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then--more screaming--Yvette--the billiard room! We all rushed out!

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Maybe one of us was murdering the cook. Who wasn't here with us?

</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
The guests pause.
</DIRECTION>
<GREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREEN>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(with certainty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues at his breathless rate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While we stood here, trying to stop Yvette from panicking ...

<DIRECTION>
He leaves for the study.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR--THE STUDY
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>

<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, how could he risk it? We might have seen him running back.

</PEACOCK>

Wadsworth goes over to the freezer and pushes open the back of the freezer, exposing the kitchen/study secret passage.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if they used this secret passage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>

Mrs. Peacock gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>

<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why should we believe you?

</PEACOCK>
<WADSWORTH>

	Because she was with us all in the billiard room doorway while Yvette was screaming, don't you remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I don't understand is, why was the cook murdered? She had nothing to do with Mr. Boddy.

<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(conspiratorially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gathered you all here together because you were all implicated in Mr. Boddy's dastardly blackmail. Did none of you deduce that the others were involved, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Evidently no one had.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What others?

</WADSWORTH>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how he got all his information. Before he could blackmail anyone, Mr. Boddy had to discover their guilty secret. The cook and Yvette were his accomplices!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see! So ... whoever knew ... that the cook was involved ... killed her?

<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Col. Mustard looks very happy.

<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, because I was Mr. Boddy's butler, that the cook had worked for one of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>

The guests ask who it was.

	You recognized Yvette, didn't you? Don't deny it.

	What do you mean, "don't deny it"? I'm not denying anything.

</WHITE>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another denial!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. White sticks her tongue out at Wadsworth.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, it's true. I knew Yvette. My husband had an affair with her, but I didn't care. I wasn't ... jealous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SCARLET>
<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Col. Mustard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you also knew her, sir. We've already established that you were one of Miss Scarlet's ... clients. That's why you were so desperate to get your hands on those negatives. Photographs of you and Yvette in flagrante delicto, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Boddy threatened to send those pictures to my dear old mother. The shock would have killed her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha. That would have been quite an achievement since you told us that she's dead already.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Wadsworth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, he had the motive.

</WHITE>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all had a motive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<MUSTARD>

<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he grabs Mr. Green)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we came back to the study with Yvette. Mr. Boddy was on the floor ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Wadsworth trips Mr. Green to the floor as Mr. Boddy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...pretending to be dead. But one of us noticed he's alive. So. I explained that I was Mr. Boddy's butler, and I'd invited you here, and we realized there was only one other person in the house.

The freezer door opens. Miss Scarlet screams. Wadsworth, looking quite dead, falls into Mr. Green's arms.

The exasperated Mr. Green drops the butler on the floor.

<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By now, she was dead. We laid her down with our backs to the freezer. One of us slipped through the same secret passage--

Wadsworth is pursuing a frightened Mr. Green up the hall, toward the bathroom.

</GREEN>
<DIRECTION>
Wadsworth leans against the bathroom door frame, pretending to check a watch.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And nonchalantly rejoined us beside the cook's body in the kitchen. It took less than half a minute.

He runs out, almost colliding with the just-arrived guests.

</WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE, SCARLET, and PEACOCK You did?!
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. It's obvious. Everyone here tonight was either Mr. Boddy's victim or accomplice. Everyone who has died gave him vital information about one of you. I got them here so they'd give evidence against him and force him to confess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? What about that motorist? What kind of information did he have?

<MUSTARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew that I was a war profiteer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses) (continues, painfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stole essential Air Force radio parts, and I sold them on the black market. That is how I made all my money. But that does not make me a murderer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUSTARD>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a lot of our airmen died because their radios didn't work! Was the policeman working for Mr. Boddy, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEACOCK>
<SCARLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cop was from Washington. He was on my payroll. I bribed him once a week so I could carry on with business. Mr. Boddy found out somehow ...

The men drop the singing telegram girl's body on the floor.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Now you all know why they died. Whoever killed Mr. Boddy also wanted his accomplices dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PLUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did the murderer know about them all? I mean, I admit that I had guessed that this young singer informed on me to Mr. Boddy ... but I didn't know anything about any of you until this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUM>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, the murder needed to get the weapons. Easy. He stole the key from my pocket. And then we all followed Colonel Mustard's suggestion that we split up and search the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADSWORTH>
<PEACOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, it was Colonel Mustard's suggestion!

</PEACOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Col. Mustard cannot meet their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one of us got away from his or her partner and hurried to the study. On the desk was the envelope from Mr. Boddy. It contained photographs and letters--the evidence of Mr. Boddy's network of informants.

</WADSWORTH>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the envelope now?

The doorbell rings.

Scarlet is distracted by it. Wadsworth turns her arm around, taking the gun and forcing her to kneel on the floor.

Mr. Green runs for the door and opens it.

The murderer picked up the gun where Yvette dropped it, ran to the door, opened it, recognized the girl from her picture, shot her, and ran back to the cellar!

	You murdered them all. You were the person who was missing when the cook and Mr. Boddy were murdered. And the cook used to be your cook! Don't you remember your fatal mistake?

<WADSWORTH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Now, I suggest that we stack the bodies in the cellar, lock it, leave quietly, one at a time, and pretend than none of this has ever happened.

The rest of guests start to sing as well. Mrs. White takes a harmony.

Mrs. Peacock carefully slips out the door.

Wadsworth starts striding away.
</DIRECTION>
<WADSWORTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's consider each murder one by one. Professor Plum, you knew that Mr. Boddy was still alive. Even psychiatrists can tell the difference between patients who are alive or dead. You fired the gun at him in the dark and missed, so you pretended he was dead. That's how you were able to kill him later, unobserved.

<SCARLET>

	That's right! He was the missing person in the kitchen after we found the cook dead!
