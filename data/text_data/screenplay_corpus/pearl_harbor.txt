EXT. POV OF AN AIRPLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of BLACK we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flying over American heartland. We see the earth through the pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the plane swooping down and storming over the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants. It releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like honey over family farms stretching to the horizon. Maybe it's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee. But as long as there's been an America, men have fought and died for this place -- as volunteers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far off, but visible from the plane is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BARN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says "McCawley Crop Dusting." Another plane noise, this one made by kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats, and wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg they've replaced the seat with. They've even attached a 2x4 as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help. They wear overalls and have bowl haircuts: RAFE and DANNY, 10 years old.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bandits at 2 o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power dive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
They buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls, Rafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Germans!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill the bastards!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine gun and engine sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good shooting, Danny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good shooting, Rafe!

</DANNY>
<RAFE>

	Home of the brave!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's another one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Their vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still left -- are rotting. He's also missing an arm; but the one that's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You no count boy! Johnson come lookin', said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel his pig shed, and I can't find you no place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY_S_FATHER>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy, I told you I was comin' here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
His father slaps him off his feet. Rafe is so horrified he can't get a sound out. Danny isn't even surprised. But when his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps so tight they choke him, he struggles. It does no good; his father starts marching across the field, dragging and strangling Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Da!... Dad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until CRACK! The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking him to the ground and making him drop Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the 2x4 like a bat.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
The father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafe... Daddy... No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bust you open, you...German!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
The words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken brain. He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom of blood to his mouth. He wipes it with his hand, but blood clings to his teeth. He chokes out --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fought the Germans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY_S_FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's just done. He turns and staggers away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by something deeper than blood. Then Danny runs off after his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy! Daddy! Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind Rafe. The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's goin' on, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE_S_FATHER>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Danny's Dad just come to get him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4 propeller. His father looks toward Danny and his father, walking away, then looks at his own son.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, boy -- you wanna go up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE_S_FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his father's lap. As his father cranks the engine and tucks him into the harness, Rafe says --
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<RAFE_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure will, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE_S_FATHER>

The engine races to life...and we --

EXT. NEW JERSEY AIR BASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
American P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming and wind singing by their wings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we focus on two: RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome. And DANNY WALKER is very much the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while the other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and Danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high, the other diving and coming back up in his place, leapfrogging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and out, so close. The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through binoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McCawley! Walker! Cut that out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought this was a training flight. I'm just trying to give Danny some training.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not on your best day, boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction he was moving before. Danny reacts almost instantly... leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out of everybody else.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, get into a wedge!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and Danny just behind and on either side of the center.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you say test the limits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe grins, loving the challenge. Then he and Danny do the leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut down their props, slide back the canopies and hop down. We see young pilots we'll get to know: ANTHONY, BILLY, RED.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are McCawley and Walker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now heading right at each other, like two bullets playing chicken.

</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE COCKPITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so close they can't possibly get out of each other's way. Billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown out the sound of the collision...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other belly to belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COCKPITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Danny burst out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
laugh and congratulate each other.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what they say... You can take the crop duster out of the country -- but don't put him in a P-40.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him. Danny has Rafe's plane in his sights.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I had guns I'd be chewing up your --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
They're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny. But as Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and snaps the nose of his plane straight up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>

	He's doing an inside loop!

Danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come in behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yee-hawww!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny taxis his plane over to join the others. He's grinning as he slides back his cockpit cover; then --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Rafe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the air. Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to refasten his harness.
</DIRECTION>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're down, Walker! That's an order!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?

</DANNY>
<TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not taking my orders anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRAINING_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he notices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gonna do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

RAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above them, and seems to pause in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't'a done an inside loop. I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

</ANTHONY_BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene. He noses the plane into a power dive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going so fast it begins to shudder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed. Red is so nervous he can't get the words out.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-

</RED>
<BILLY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do it, Rafe. You can do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed, snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the runway. Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside of the circle. The plane reaches the top of its arc, and almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the earth, only this time he has very little altitude. The plane hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the curve...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And makes it full circle. Rafe's head now is barely a foot off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his canopy. Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could've killed yourself, you stupid bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe.

	That was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the base. He's as tough as he is good in the air. And right now he's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOLITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOLITTLE>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DOOLITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get smart with me, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOLITTLE>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, Sir. I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit. And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks. To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DOOLITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's bullshit, son. But it's really good bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOLITTLE>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Sir.

Doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's hand.

	Good luck over there McCawley. I admire your decision.

The pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town. Danny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on cologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.

<DIRECTION>
Anthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks. Billy declares to his image in the mirror --

</BILLY>
<ANTHONY>

	No, numbnuts, die. You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen. But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight." I've never known it to fail.

INT. A MOVING TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats, shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy section. But the glow of the train is outshone by EVELYN STEWART. She's one of ten young women, Army nurses, gathered at one end of the car as it rattles along the track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too ripe. Their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered, their spirits high.

Evelyn listens in amusement to BETTY, a cute blonde with unmissable boobs, and BARBARA, a burnette equally endowed.

A silence among the nurses.

Our pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are waiting on the platform. Among then is Rafe, holding something behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders to a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and giving the moment a dream-like haze.

They move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his eyes holding Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Lieutenant. Good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, Lieutenant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Betty clears her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this is Betty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you, Betty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two roses. He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny would'a brought this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He escorts them along the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny's not coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping to meet him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping to meet him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll just have to find a substitute, won't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Betty stops, and faces Rafe.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to tell you one thing. If you're thinking this might be your last night on earth?... I'm prepared to make it meaningful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning close)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very meaningful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ease, Betty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging, beautiful young men and women in high spirits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other pilots and nurses. Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy with Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself next to Betty. Betty's already found a companion in Red Strange.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He, I'm R-Red. Red S-Strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red...Strange?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the football player, Red G- Grange? Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...they called you Strange? Because of Red Grange? I don't get it. Was Red Grange strange?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Beside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and swigs from that. Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep from laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you always stutter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only when I'm n-n-n-
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nervous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SIIING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
She covers his hand with hers.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Red looks at Betty with love in his eyes. Under the table, Rafe and Evelyn join hands too.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There shipping us out. Hawaii. The Germans are overrunning Europe, and we're sent to paradise. How about you? Have you heard anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation beside them, between Barbara and Billy.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a very special woman, and...well baby, they're training me for war, and we don't know what happens tomorrow. So we gotta make tonight special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you can back that up, flyboy. Cause you're not ever gonna forget tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet... They start dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've been in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the dancers, outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the river, and Manhattan beyond. Evelyn takes in the view, breathes in the air; she still holds the rose.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it. But I've got to because it's true. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must surprise you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
The power of hearing this from each other grips them both.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all going away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You waited til tonight to tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He studies her face, burning it into his memory.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable. What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do one thing for me, before you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand and leads him inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the others, yet in a world apart from everyone else. And then they stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the kind of kiss that lasts a lifetime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurses are entering the hotel. Pilots are going in with them. But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A last kiss. Their hands touch a final time, and then part. She moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as he walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Danny stand on the platform. Rafe's got his gear packed in a bag slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All aboard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the station that lead onto the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you say you told her not to come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why are you looking for her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a test. If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ALL ABOARD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still a kid, ya know that? Take care of yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe sticks his hand out to Danny. Danny knocks it away, and hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away. Rafe waves. Danny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give 'em hell, Rafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe finds a seat and sits down. He's the only one in the car, and he's deeply alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the station. He takes the one on the far right. As he passes through it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on the left side. She's told herself she wouldn't come, but couldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the train disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE - THE JOURNEYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward opposite ends of the earth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A GRAY, COLD, CANADIAN SEAPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Rafe boards a Canadian naval vessel headed into the North Atlantic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN - TRAVELING THROUGH THE AMERICAN WEST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn and her fellow nurses ride the train through the American southwest. The scenery outside the window is beautiful, but her thoughts are far away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters. The deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain. Rafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the rain, his thoughts on Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is heading. A deep, dark storm is brewing before them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite direction, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is warm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face. The MONTAGE ENDS, with them heading to different ends of the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray. British fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines. Rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag. He moves up behind a slim, pale BRITISH AIR COMMANDER who is surveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafe McCawley, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the salute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone. Rafe freezes at the sight, reminded of Danny's father.
</DIRECTION>
<BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's me, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley. We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a string of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a shot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood still splattered over the inside of the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good lad. Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine. Welcome to the war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEARL HARBOR - MILITARY BASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps. As they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially Evelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've died and gone to heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses. The jeeps drive through. The nurses are loving this island paradise already.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the ratio of men to women on this island? Four-thousand...to one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm trees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the jeeps pull away --
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya on the beach, boys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILITARY BASE - NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the other nurses happily unpack, Evelyn leaves and crosses the grass in the drenching sunshine. We follow her into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASE HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds a small, immaculately clean hospital, twenty beds with luminous white sheets, all empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she notices the view. It's of Pearl Harbor, with the entire American Pacific fleet riding at anchor. Battleships all in a row. Aircraft carriers too, in perfect stillness on the aqua blue water with a white sand bottom. The view is expansive and beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of an approaching fighter plane with wing guns firing as we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DARK SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his Spitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again into a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British planes, and they're tougher and faster. Rafe darts through their line, machine guns blazing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the engine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its pilot, NIGEL, frantic as the German planes swarm into finish him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRITISH_PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(NIGEL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need help! Someone get them off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRITISH_PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power dive at one of the Messerschmidts. Rafe's bullets chew up its cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral, down into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe instantly climbs again. Nigel, in the moment of safety Rafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and carrying him toward the water. The OTHER BRITISH PILOTS are impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_BRITISH_PILOT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nigel's out! I'll call in the position!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Yank is bloody good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHER_BRITISH_PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe swings his plane right back at the Germans; he attacks them head on, just like he went at Danny, only this time he's firing his machine guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And OVER THIS ferocious dogfight, we hear his letter to Evelyn...
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(LETTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Evelyn... It is cold here. So cold, in a way that goes deep into your bones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the stream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into pieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed. Before it completely comes apart, it explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(LETTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not easy making friends. Two nights ago I drank a beer with a couple of the R.A.F. pilots -- beer's the only thing here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both of them got killed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As Rafe starts another attack we see him in the cockpit, in the trance of battle, as other Spitfires around him are getting shot out of the sky...as we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn, receiving the letter at mail call.

She sits on the grass under a palm tree, in paradise, reading his letter.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is one place I can go to find warmth, and that is to think of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - OAHU - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress. She's let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat in the tropical heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor. Evelyn sits alone. She's brought writing paper. As the Hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But before she can start to write, three naval officers move over to her table from the bar. They're out of uniform too, wearing garish tropical shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<NAVY_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A woman beautiful as you shouldn't be sitting alone. Buy you a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAVY_GUY_1>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>

The guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell.

<NAVY_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ensign! Smart too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAVY_GUY_1>
<NAVY_GUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how about that drink? Or dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAVY_GUY_2>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, but...I really want to be alone right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<NAVY_GUY_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to see something long and hard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAVY_GUY_3>
<DIRECTION>
He shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm. Evelyn looks away from them, toward the harbor.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I've got a letter to write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<NAVY_GUY_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAVY_GUY_3>
<DIRECTION>
His friends start to pull him away, but Evelyn's eyes flare.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<NAVY_GUY_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said you're cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NAVY_GUY_3>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold? No, I'm just thinking about a war. And maybe you should be too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
They leave, shaking their heads. Evelyn picks up her pen, and writes.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(LETTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Rafe... It's strange to be so far from you in body, and so close to you in spirit. But if our spirits really give our bodies life, then you should know this: Every night I look at the sunset, and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again...

Rafe brings his battered plane in for a landing...

Rafe sits on his cot, reading her letter.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...and send it from my heart to yours.

</EVELYN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe is startled as the Air Commander appears beside his bunk.
</DIRECTION>
<BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Air-Sea Rescue picked up Nigel. He'll be back with us tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe nods, glad to hear the news. The Commander starts to walk away, then turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of us look down on the Yanks for not yet joining this war. I'd just like to say that if there are many more back home like you, God help anyone who goes to war with America.

</BRITISH_AIR_COMMANDER>
<DIRECTION>
The Commander salutes, with his left hand. And Rafe salutes too -- with his left hand.

EXT. ESTABLISHING THE WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The White House looks somehow whiter and purer in the glow of 1941.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRESIDENTIAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENERALS, ADMIRALS, and other advisors sit around the polished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms. The door opens, and the men all stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT appears, in a wheelchair, pushed by a huge black valet, GEORGE. The President's legs are shriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his shoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped pants. From the waist up Roosevelt is heavily muscled, powerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles. The valet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even before he settles in.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_ROOSEVELT>

EXT. ESTABLISHING TOKYO - JAPAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAPANESE HIGH COMMAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Conference Room is similar to that of the White House. But this table is low and all the men sit on the floor. And there are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by its warriors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO. Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council. Yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend Genda, who can't hide his fear. Yamamoto glances to the far end of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Council, sits glowering. (Their discussion is in Japanese, with subtitles.)
</DIRECTION>
<NISHIKURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you join us, Admiral. Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NISHIKURA>
<YAMAMOTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAMAMOTO>
<NISHIKURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The time has come to strike! Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future. I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong. Yet look at their leader.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NISHIKURA>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to OYAMA, an intelligence analyst, who opens a file and lays out pictures of Roosevelt.
</DIRECTION>
<OYAMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franklin Roosevelt. Born into great wealth. Fifteen years ago, he was stricken with polio. Now he cannot walk, or even stand without help. Photographers will not take pictures of him in his chair; Americans do not wish to know how weak their President is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OYAMA>
<DIRECTION>
Yamamoto makes a low grunt.
</DIRECTION>
<NISHIKURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have something to say, Yamamoto?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NISHIKURA>
<YAMAMOTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans. No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover. In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAMAMOTO>
<NISHIKURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see us as capable of such a blow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NISHIKURA>
<YAMAMOTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Americans themselves have made it possible. We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAMAMOTO>
<DIRECTION>
The members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto that they bow to him. Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long enough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face.

EXT. PEARL HARBOR - AIR BASE - BARRACKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny Walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they enter the barracks, talking happily.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their beds, sleeping off hangovers. They wear Hawaiian shirts; they haven't shaved.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're s-still asleep!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Danny pauses for a moment, then shouts --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop your cocks and grab your socks, boys! The terror of the skies are here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their pillows.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
One guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible taste from his mouth. As his feet dangle over the side of the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he blinks as if trying to remember how it got there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, COMA.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. You. Mr. Coma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's that lizard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What lizard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one that slept in my mouth last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell happened to you guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about to burp.
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever hear of mai-tai's? Comes in a big...pot. Like...like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<RED>

	A m-missionary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has Danny and his buddies wincing back from the fumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an Air Base? Where's your squad commander?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The question soaks through to Coma's brain. His right hand points...and his left hand points...in different directions. His hands float around in the air until finally both of them are indicating the same direction, behind his back. In the bunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red Strange.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys are new?

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</DANNY>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mai-tai's. I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment he's looking for something under the bed. Then he pukes. Danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the barracks; his friends follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEARL HARBOR - AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and his buddies stride up to the airfield. It's full of fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in clusters on the field. Danny grabs a MECHANIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about easier to hit in an air raid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's gonna to that? Japan is four thousand miles away. So you guys just arrived, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a saying here. A-low-HA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<DIRECTION>
The mechanic walks off. Danny and the guys are left standing on the tarmac.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well guys...I reckon there's just one thing to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OAHU BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and the pilots are in Hawaiian shirts, their party in full swing. A bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the crater. It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as the last liquid is sucked dry.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More m-mai-tai's!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Coma is sitting there with them, beside Red.
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in with the others. Danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his own thoughts. Billy and Anthony are doing the hula to the Hawaiian music playing.
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you guys aren't doing it right. It's in the hands. They talk story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures of his hula.
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fish swim in ocean... Happy in the Mother Sea... Girl, beautiful girl, with big jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at her thighs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<ANTHONY>

	I never knew those dances were so sophisticated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Fish nibble at her breasts...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows --
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A more beautiful girl walks by...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
The guys see Evelyn passing on the other side of the street, gorgeous in the sunshine. Coma's hands start squeezing the imaginary breasts of his hula.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, isn't that Evelyn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny moves up to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys know her?! I gotta have an intro! Man, I'd like to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's hand is suddenly around Coma's larynx.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A friend of mine's in love with her. So you don't even look -- not ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny releases him and Coma staggers back to the table to nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base hospital. Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly Hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full of the potent liquid. He shouts to the whole room --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a better pilot than any son-of-a- bitch on this island! So I'm the one to say this! Here's to Rafe McCawley! A better pilot...and a better man...than me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws.
</DIRECTION>
<OTHER_PILOTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Rafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OTHER_PILOTS>
<DIRECTION>
Danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down onto the table. Then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach, and frowns. Coma recognizes the look.
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh oh. Volcanic eruption!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table.
</DIRECTION>
<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, he's puking on my feet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you p-puked on his feet.

Kimmel's STRATEGIC ANALYST speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<STRATEGIC_ANALYST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've done what you ordered, Admiral, and war gamed the likely outcome of a Japanese attack against each of our major bases in the Pacific. Wake, Guam, Midway, the Philippines. In each case, we lose.

<ADMIRAL_KIMMEL>

	You left out Hawaii.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADMIRAL_KIMMEL>
<STRATEGIC_ANALYST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pearl Harbor can't be attacked effectively from the air. It's too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack. Pearl Harbor's safe. It's everywhere else that we're vulnerable.

EXT. THE SKIES ABOVE OAHU - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above Pearl Harbor and around the island of Oahu. One Japanese tourist shoots pictures rapidly...first of the ships as seen from overhead; then he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots pictures of the airfield below them.
</DIRECTION>

Another Japanese tourist hikes through the hills above Pearl Harbor. He takes an excellent camera from his picnic basket, and shoots pictures.

	They think no one would be stupid enough to attack them at Pearl Harbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAMAMOTO>
<GENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or perhaps they think no one is capable. Look at this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDA>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple display showing water depth and ship displacement.
</DIRECTION>
<GENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet makes them feel safe. A torpedo dropped from an airplane plunges to one hundred feet before it can level off. That is a conventional torpedo. But we have been experimenting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDA>
<DIRECTION>
From a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden fins, attached to a circular metallic band.
</DIRECTION>
<GENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wooden fins. We are testing them tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet Japanese island, sunlit and pleasant. They are gathered on the shore of the island's natural harbor. Wooden targets -- basically huge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at anchor. A squadron of Japanese planes zooms overhead, taking up attack positions.
</DIRECTION>
<GENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have chosen this place because its depth is exactly the same as Pearl Harbor's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Genda speaks into a field radio. A lone plane drops out of formation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and dropping its torpedo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW THE SURFACE we see the torpedo as it plunges at two hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea. With the wooden fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the sea floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE THE SURFACE the planners see the path of the torpedo; it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying THUNK. The planners are impressed -- but Yamamoto is not satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<YAMAMOTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YAMAMOTO>
<GENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDA>
<DIRECTION>
Yamamoto nods; Genda speaks again into his radio, and another plane swoops down and drops a torpedo. Genda holds his hands to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though they wonder at the need.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening, and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to toothpicks.
</DIRECTION>
<GENDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course against a ship the explosion will not be dissipated, and will have more force.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDA>
<DIRECTION>
The planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they knew that all the time.

	Oh...Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one for me, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, can't you see...

Anthony and Billy look at each other, dumbfounded. The nurses move to the open windows. Red's singing is pretty good -- though not that good. But he doesn't stutter when he sings.

	I'll be yours for eternity, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty!

Anthony and Billy are hysterical, trying to keep their laughter hidden. But then they see the effect this is having on the women -- especially on Betty. She's smitten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he finishes, Betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses applaud. They move off into the darkness, arm and arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurses go back to their primping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony and Billy are changed men. Anthony stands up; Billy's baffled. Anthony moves out and starts singing.

The Spitfires' bullets rip into the pilot and also kill the nose gunner; the bomber dips as the copilot struggles to take control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAFE, IN HIS SPITFIRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he streaks past, Rafe sees the bomber wobble in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got him hurt, stay on him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe throws his plane into an ultra-tight, high speed turn, right between the tails of the leader German group and the noses of the second. His turn is so tight that the plane flexes with the g-force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and races back up through the formation of German bombers, moving above them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest. He stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the wounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the other German bombers, and shears off, heading through the smoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got him going!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to face the bombers again. This time the g-force of the turn pops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil begins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls, and worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it and makes it worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His wingman sees him veering away from the bombers...and sees the German fighters moving up to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<SQUAD_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McCawley! Get to the clouds! Get into the clouds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SQUAD_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
RAFE, IN HIS PLANE, is flying blind.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see the clouds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
His problems are just beginning; the fluid is dripping down onto his cockpit's corroded electrical wiring; the fluid causes an arc...a spark...and suddenly a fire is spreading through Rafe's plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his fire extinguisher and triggers a cloud that snuffs the fire but fills the entire cockpit with choking smoke; between that and the smeared fluid on his glass, he can't see a thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the Messerschmidts are swarming over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's wingman dives in, raking the German planes as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe tries to open his cockpit cover to clear the smoke, but it's jammed; he pulls out his .45 pistol and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for him to take a breath and try to see. He fights the stick, but the plane won't respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his engine.
</DIRECTION>
<SQUAD_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of there, McCawley! Get out of there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SQUAD_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds, then clear air again. The Squad Leader tries to chase and cover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of the plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the Squad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the plane hits, splashing and exploding all at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he reports on his radio...
</DIRECTION>

	McCawley down. No 'chute.

EXT. BATTLESHIP WEST VIRGINIA - PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight championship fight, a contest made more interesting to the sailors because one of the combatants is white and the other is black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battle is more toughness than technique. The guys throwing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped area, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets. The white guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's belly, making him back up and say --
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_BOXER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hit hard -- for a cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_BOXER>
<DIRECTION>
The black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a fresh cut over his right eye. The white guy now rushes in, and the black guy (his name is DORIE MILLER) throws an upper cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sailors cheer wildly. Dorie steps back, and rubs his glove across his brow. It's really bleeding now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILITARY BASE - DAY

Evelyn is returning from church with six of her nurse friends. It's very quiet on a Sunday morning, almost nobody at the base; they walk along the path.

</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you, sailor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
As Dorie turns, she sees the cut on his head, closed only with a band-aid; it's dripping blood down his T-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DORIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Scuse me, 'Mam. All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.

INT. HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - LATER

Evelyn clips the ends of her carefully applied stitches; Dorie's eyes are rolled up as if he could watch from inside his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>

She walks him to the door.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DORIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man. They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat. I shine the officer's shoes. In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DORIE>

Now Evelyn understands.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorie walks away, down the path between the palm trees. She watches him go, and then is transfixed by someone else coming, silhouetted by the light of the setting sun. She can't make out his face, but he's wearing a pilot's dress uniform, and coming to her right out of the warm orange sunset that she has stared at so many times. Her heart slams against her ribs; she takes a few steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Rafe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She moves toward him, and he draws near her, walking slowly. And then she sees his face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Danny. His face as sad as death itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And even before he tells her, she knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker. I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A BENCH - OVERLOOKING PEARL HARBOR - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn and Danny sit on the bench, with a sweeping view of the harbor and the lights winking on all around it as the sun settles beyond the horizon. Evelyn is stoic, numb; Danny is the one who is struggling.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. Real straight, frugal. My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along. Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral. He took me back to his house, and I never left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were more like brothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He said that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn nods, still staring away from Danny. This pierces Danny; he looks away, struggling not to let the emotions pull him completely under.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, uh...Rafe's dad...he wrote me with the news, and it took me a couple of days to work up the guts to come here and tell you. I'm not as brave as Rafe, or as noble. But if there's anything I can ever do to help -- you let me know, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
She stares into the distance. He stands and puts his hand on top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand why Rafe loved you. You're as strong as he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move away. When he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and sees her figure in the gathering darkness. She's begun to break down; and as he watches, her whole body starts convulsing, and she doubles up in shattering grief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts a hand on her shoulder. He sits beside her again, and suddenly she turns to him and sobs upon him. Danny wraps her gently in his arms, and then he breaks down, having found the first place he can truly grieve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JAPANESE BOMBING PRACTICE - JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Japanese have constructed a replica of Pearl Harbor on their practice island; erecting new target barriers and silhouettes of the various ships anchored at Pearl. Streams of Japanese planes skim overhead in practice bombing runs, dropping dummy torpedoes and bombs. From a control platform erected on the beach, Yamamoto and Genda oversee it all.

	Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.

He nods to a VICE ADMIRAL, who stands over the map.
</DIRECTION>
<VICE_ADMIRAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Between America and the Far East are the sea lanes where the winds and the currents make the best route for shipping. Far above is the northern route, between Canada and Russia. Between these two is something they call the Vacant Sea. If I were the Japs, I'd send a task force there. You could hide the entire land mass of Asia in the Vacant Sea, and nobody would know.

<ADMIRAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So they pop out and attack where?

EXT. MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn walks out of the hospital. She's still wearing her lei. The sun is going down in a spectacular sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world. She breathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the sadness. The water of the harbor laps close to where she stands, the sunset polishing its surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and holds it like the rose Rafe once gave her. Then she tosses the rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away, as the sun sinks behind the horizon.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BASE CANTEEN - NIGHT

Danny and Evelyn are having coffee at the base canteen.

<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's everything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to. Rafe was...he was lonely. He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty. The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices the tears welling up in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have.

EXT. HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A P-40 takes off from the remote airfield, lit only by the full moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. P-40 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn sits on Danny's lap, like Rafe sat in his Daddy's lap years before. Danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms slipped under hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky above them is startlingly clear; a billion stars dancing around a full moon.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So beautiful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He spins the plane in an easy half turn, inverting their heads above Pearl Harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the battleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water, embraced by the island of Oahu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P-40 soars easily in and settles to earth. Danny shuts down the engine. Danny carefully removes the harness around her. She looks overhead. The stars are still bright above them.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't realize until tonight that I've stopped wanting to live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns in his lap, and looks at him. Their eyes connect. Tentatively, almost reluctantly, they kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV of someone moving through the gathering darkness approaches the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow, where Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a giant's jewel box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell who. He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Evelyn through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn moves to her desk, and sits down. She looks at the calender turning back to October, where she wrote on the square of October 22, "Order supplies" -- she counts the weeks from then to today, December 6.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the full figure of the man watching her. And now we see his face. It is Rafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His left hand is bandaged, but he is very much alive -- though seeing Evelyn has taken his breath, and even seems to have robbed him of the power to move. His eyes pick up every detail of her -- her face...her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as Rafe watches Evelyn, he has the SUDDEN JOLTS OF SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS...punctuated by fragments of the letter she wrote to him, and INTERCUT with Rafe in the present, watching Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dearest Rafe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
IN SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK, RAFE'S SPITFIRE, crippled and trailing smoke, passing through a patch of cloud as Rafe hurls himself from the cockpit and jerks the ripcord of his chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PRESENT...Rafe's face winces with the memory, and he rivets his eyes on Evelyn, as if to force himself to know that this moment is real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK...RAFE LANDS IN THE WATER, and the shock of its coldness travels up his body faster than his body sinks into the water. He's cloaked in the fog; his parachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face down. He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and pulls the release...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes, his heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going down; his body sinks beneath the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Every sunset...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PRESENT, Rafe's chest trembles... Is it from the memory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn again -- or both?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS -- Below the surface of the North Sea, Rafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up...he kicks off his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and starts tying the cuffs into knots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, in a CUT, he is floating in the water, his pants turned into a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking convulsively from the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then in another CUT we see him after he's been in the water for so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost consciousness. He has no strength, no will to live... His face settles into the water...his body slips from his preserver, and drifts beneath the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...gather it's heat into my heart, and send it to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
IN FLASHBACK, Rafe beneath the surface... His eyes come open. From his POV beneath the water, he sees something above the surface. It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less real...an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face above the surface... His limbs come to life, and he fights his way up, breaking the surface. The whole sea around him is dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and holds on for dear life...and for Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PRESENT Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but he can't go in. He backs away from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PILOT'S BARRACKS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Japanese-American MESSAGE BOY parks his motorbike outside and enters the barracks.
</DIRECTION>
<MESSAGE_BOY>

Danny rises from his bunk and accepts the telegram. As the message boy leaves, Danny reads... The news he learns stuns him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BENCH - OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe is still lost in thought. He hears steps running up -- and sees Danny -- who spots him at the same moment.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - Evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench, his form hauntingly familiar. He hears her, and looks up. It's Rafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Evelyn's POV, the whole world spins. She faints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground. He gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face. He's real, very real.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evelyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
She's trembling, shaking. He lifts her to her feet, and moves her to the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why were you sitting here, instead of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew. You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Survive? I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me. I hit the water hard. And it was so...cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades to black. There's something he thinks about saying, and doesn't. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how long I was in the water. A Norwegian freighter picked me up. They were headed to Spain. They docked in La Rota, right beside a German ship, and told me to stay hidden below. I was afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some clothes, jumped ship, and found a church, where the priest contacted the resistance, and got me on a freighter to New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, then looks down again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle. The Colonel sent a man to pick me up. They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done a lot of talking. You haven't said anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing that won't heal. I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
At these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the troubled look on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I've assumed too much. Has something changed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid to ask what. And I'm afraid not to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you fallen in love?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods; she can't even say it. Rafe's dying inside.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote. It's just that -- I thought you were dead. And now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Danny runs up, through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Danny stare at each other; Danny hesitates, looking from Rafe to Evelyn, wondering what they've said. Then Rafe looks at Evelyn, and picks up the look on her face. In that moment he puts it all together.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, God. Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's speechless, and for a moment Evelyn is too.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
He puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly. Evelyn and Danny are left frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHORE OF PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing. As he stands there alone and shattered, he has one more
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe is in the water of the North Sea; he seems dead, but his makeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface. Something slides through the water and stops beside him; it's a dinghy, and behind it is a trawler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands grab Rafe and drag him onto the dinghy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the trawler. The crewmen think he's dead. His body is stiff, his lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid, then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses back an eyelid to see his pupils. Rafe's white lips move. The crewmen realize he's trying to say something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the Norwegian crewmen don't understand.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evelyn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PRESENT Rafe struggles to bury that memory so far that he'll never feel it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NURSES' QUARTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny escorts Evelyn back to her quarters.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt, and Danny leave quickly. Betty steps out of the nurses' quarters and hands Evelyn a telegram.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This came while you were gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn knows it's the telegram from Rafe, to tell her he's alive. Without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries away from the barracks so the other nurses won't see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HICKAM FIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny crosses the tarmac toward the clustered P-40's. He spots what he's looking for. Sitting in the cockpit of one of the P-40's is Rafe. Rafe won't look at him. Danny climbs up on the wing, and sits down there.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upset? Why should I be upset?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. FUNKY OAHU BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink up. Then we'll talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

Rafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the straws. Red, Anthony, Billy, and several others enter the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rafe?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
They rush the table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FUNKY OAHU BAR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking. Rafe uses glasses to show his buddies tactics.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll go under you because their planes are faster, then they run so you can't catch 'em. But then they'll come around and take you from behind -- like some Americans will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
The last words bring the group to silence. The other guys drift away, to give them room.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why be sorry? That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waitress! Four beers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress delivers four bottles to the table. Rafe takes a slow sip, then stares at Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta face some facts here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What facts are those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was grieving too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left her. How's that for a fact?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's this for a fact? I loved her first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny takes a long pull of beer, and Rafe does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you're a lousy drinker. Drinking's supposed to make men feel bigger. It only makes you stupid. And weak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! He knocks Danny out of the chair, flat on his ass. Danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want it, you got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks Rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bar's bouncer, a big Samoan, moves over to break them up -- but Anthony steps in his way.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let 'em fight, they need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
The bouncer tosses Anthony aside, but before he can move in to interrupt the fight, Red breaks a lava volcano of Mai-Tai over the bouncer's skull. The bartender picks up the phone to call the M.P.'s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the room. Sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their stools to watch the action. The other pilots are wincing with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and weaving as if in the fight themselves. A SAILOR tapes Billy.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a private fight or can anybody jump in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR>
<DIRECTION>
Billy hits him. The whole bar erupts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Danny are really having at it, fueled by so much emotion that nothing hurts. They're on the floor now, trying to rip each other apart. They struggle to their feet and Rafe manages to knee Danny in the balls. Danny doubles over in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That hurt? I didn't think you had any balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking up, Danny lunges at Rafe, tackling him around the waist, driving him at the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back window of the bar -- not covered in glass, but fronds and wood -- and out into the back alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're lying there in the debris when they see the M.P. jeeps coming. They drag each other to their feet, and run away.

Another destroyer, the RALPH TALBOT, cruises behind the Selfridge. On it's bridge, the DUTY OFFICER speaks to the CAPTAIN.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then lost it. Now our sonar reports the contact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUTY_OFFICER>

The Captain looks toward the Selfridge, then trains his binoculars on the water were the Duty Officer points. He sees something dark and black slipping along beneath the surface. He gets onto his intercom.

Danny has pulled his Buick convertible off the road; Rafe is bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up. Danny's banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits beside Rafe, who chokes out between heaves --

<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you're not pukin'?

</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'm used to it. I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.

Rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over him and he bends over again. Danny looks at his friend, and the pain is written on Danny's face.

Rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but Danny knows he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were both torn up. I started dropping by to see her, because we understood what each other felt. We'd have coffee and try not to talk about you, but we always would.

</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe stands to face Danny; this is hard for Danny to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said I was so much like you. I said, No, I'm not. I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder. But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.

<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How sweet. Is that when you put the move on her?

</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny slams his fist into Rafe's sick gut. Rafe doubles over again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what he deserved. Danny's about to apologize when once more Rafe knees him in the balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>

	That's better.

He still can't get it out, can't wake them; bursting with frustration, he suddenly blasts out singing --

<RED>

(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Jaaaps!! The Jaaaps!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
He's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera. His friends stir; what the hell? Red points outside and tries to talk, but now he can't mutter a syllable. The guys hear the explosions, and realize...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed. Seeing what's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the clustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the pilots are knocked to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn Japs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Billy jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of fighters that hasn't gone up yet.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DIRECTION>
Anthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he misses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a strafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror as Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire is sawing his legs off from the feet up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls almost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD TO MAIN AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep, Danny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight -- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one side of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the rumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation makes the sunlight flicker. Danny and Rafe squint up, their heads pounding, and realize what they're seeing. Suddenly their headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down the road, toward the base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIR BASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy taking cover and haven't even closed the barrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still undamaged. Rafe is out the door before the car stops rolling, and Danny's right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up with a bomb blast. Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their first instinct is to cover their best friend with their own bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other on the ground. They see machine gun bullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and ripping along the walls of the buildings. It's as if the whole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not leaving a single plane airworthy.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me into a plane!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny sprints; Rafe follows. Danny reaches a phone booth, and digs a dime from his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making a phone call?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more planes blow up on the flight line. Rafe thinks he's lost his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Walker! We're under attack! Get those planes fueled and armed RIGHT NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle, reaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him and leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth shatters behind them from the strafing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid strafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got Billy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He and Rafe jump up and run again. Anthony, Red, and several other pilots reach the Buick and dive in. Danny drives away, through the strafing.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.

</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six P-40's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
As the Zero pilots see the Buick moving, they go after it. Danny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging and gunning the Buick's V-8.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE OKLAHOMA - STILL AT ANCHOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their strategy flawless. Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull with a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush under and hit the next ship anchored behind. The American battleships are bobbing like see-saws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OKLAHOMA takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing thirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately begins to list.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE OKLAHOMA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure; vertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is pouring in. Men fight their way up against the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE OKLAHOMA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a wrench and start taking turns pounding S.O.S. in Morse code on the bulkhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from the deck into the water. Still the Marines on deck are firing back at the planes; some Marines are even using handguns. But courage does not save them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OKLAHOMA ROLLS OVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the fires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400 pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns turtle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW THE WATER men are sucked down with amazing force, every hair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched to the depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE OKLAHOMA, everyone and everything is spilling upside down. The ship's generators sputter out and the lights go out. The flashlights of the few sailors who can find them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills in. There is no escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW THE WATER, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom; some men are crushed there. For others it's salvation, as the BACKWASH blows them toward the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SURFACE the men are launched almost completely out of the water, before splashing back into the water and burning oil. A few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the propeller protrude above the surface, but most of the Oklahoma is under water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying wounded away from the wreckage. A bomb hits the launch and blows body parts everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OKLAHOMA - REAR COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one compartment there are a dozen trapped men. They've survived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the floor is now the ceiling. The water is up their waists. Some of the SAILORS are panicking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the light from face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't panic! Don't panic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>

<SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The air pressure will equalize it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
But the water keeps rising, along with their fears. Several of the sailors are still screaming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water's already to their bellies. One of them grabs a wrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One sailor in the middle of the room is particularly panicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering --
</DIRECTION>
<TERRIFIED_SAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me out! Get me out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRIFIED_SAILOR>
<SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>

</SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>
<TERRIFIED_SAILOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MY FOOT'S CAUGHT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRIFIED_SAILOR>
<DIRECTION>
He's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is deeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern. The water's up to the guy's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now their floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pops up again. The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth; he's already gagging.
</DIRECTION>
<SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a hacksaw in that locker?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAILOR_WITH_THE_FLASHLIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
They open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw. They hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the guy's foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream. He comes free, and surfaces gasping. His severed foot floats to the surface and then the horror really hits them. The sailor with the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood. He and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop the bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop their signaling. Now they start banging, twice as loudly as before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is a quonset hut. A mechanic named EARL, is out with the P-40's; and these are spread out, not bunched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARL AND THE P-40'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The planes here have received loving care from Earl -- which means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo belt, he yells.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sum-bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
The Buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They ready, Earl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

What stops him is the cloud of Zeros and dive bombers, shrieking in.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cover!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The guys scatter. There are sandbags around the hut, and they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the first strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the P-40's and a dive bomber blasts another. Earl stands up in shock and fury.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You absolute mother-fuckin' son of a bitch! You shot one of my planes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>

Danny pulls him down, as the Zeros roar overhead.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!

	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny, Rafe and Earl run to the planes that got hit and strip out the 20mm cannons and ammo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUONSET HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start grabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one even grabs a rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANDBAGS BY THE SHED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two groups run back and start to set up.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, over there! We're in a canyon, they'll come straight down it, we'll get 'em in a crossfire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny, Rafe and Earl run to a gully opposite the shed and set up there, as the other pilots brace the machine guns against the sandbags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Japanese planes attacks again. This time the lead plane hits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the bullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane EXPLODES. The airborne debris makes the following planes shear off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros --
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D-don't like it when we fight back, do ya!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Red runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when the planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earl! You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<EARL>

Earl shoots a look to Rafe, then turns to Danny.

</EARL>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anthony, Red, stay with the guns! Coma, you cover the cannons! Joe, Theo, come with us! Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the pilots, Joe and Theo, run to Danny.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your call, Rafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rolling as fast as you can. Stay low! We'll use the topography to separate them and then we can take 'em one on one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
They race toward the planes, and the Japanese attack again. Seeing the pilots running for the P-40's, the Zeros aim for them; Rafe and Danny race for the most distant of the planes; Joe and Theo run for the closer planes, through the dusty bullet hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theo makes his plane and is just strapping himself in when bullets stitch his fuselage, wounding him. He still forces the plane forward. He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets chopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters to a stop, Theo dead at the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and heads down the runway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 M.P.H. The Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane breaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it smashes down on the tarmac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Danny have reaches the more distant P-40's and are revving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate. They throw on their radio headsets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their way seems blocked: they've got no runway behind them, the wreckage of four P-40's scattered ahead of them, and the Zeros screaming over the low hills to attack them. Now Rafe and Danny talk through the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
They gun their engines and roll through the grass on either side of the runway, dodging the burning planes; they lift off, clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches. They blow right through the strafing fire, and into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eight Zeros are all over them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earl is in the hut, on the radio and watching through binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see six...seven...eight of the cocksuckers! Don't let 'em hurt my planes.
	</DIALOGUE>

Danny's swiveling in his seat, looking left, right, back.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all over us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny understands immediately, following Rafe's tactic as he breaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut, palm trees, and low hills to shake the Japs. They fly like crop dusters, skimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up, banking left and right. The Zeros have divided into two groups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they try to follow the Americans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It feels like a 200 M.P.H. car chase, 20 feet off the ground, Rafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but there are too many Japanese.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny! Let's play some chicken!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny banks in one direction, Rafe in another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OVER THE LANDING STRIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two P-40's are screaming, rushing at each other like they did at the training base back in the states, flying right into each other's propellers; the Japanese heading after them realize they're rushing headlong at the other group...
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit, oh shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
He can't even watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last instant Rafe and Danny snap a quarter spin so the planes flash by belly to belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the Zeros collide in mid-air, exploding, as the other Zeros scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've lost the Zeros. The P-40's are flying smoothly, side by side. The two pilots look across at each other, going into battle together. They speak through their radios.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear my okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.

<RAFE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
He fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do. Rafe does the same. Up ahead they see a formation of Japanese planes, headed toward Pearl.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're in strafing formation, we'll blow right through their line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
They look across at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Land of the free.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Home of the brave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Side by side the P-40's scream in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABOVE OAHU - THE DOGFIGHT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation, their minds on the targets below them in the harbor. But their day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two P-40's blast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros. Both Zeros falter and begin to lose altitude. The P-40's make almost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go after the two plane they crippled on the first pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame in the air. Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P-40's swoop up again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're trying to hold formation. We can chew 'em up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
The P-40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of Zeros. Rafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and Danny comes in behind it, finishing it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their radios, but their SQUADRON COMMANDER sees Pearl Harbor ahead, and tells them --
</DIRECTION>
<JAPANESE_SQUADRON_COMMANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold the line!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAPANESE_SQUADRON_COMMANDER>
<DIRECTION>
The P-40's come through again, their guns spitting fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER JAPANESE FORMATION OF BOMBERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These planes are different -- high altitude bombers with three-man crews, high above the harbor. The bombardier looks through his sight and the bomb bays open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE BOMBARDIER'S SIGHT, the ships look like tops, far below. The bombardier is ticking off the targets as they pass, the first two he mentions already burning.
</DIRECTION>
<JAPANESE_BOMBARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	West Virginia... Oklahoma... Ah, Arizona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAPANESE_BOMBARDIER>
<DIRECTION>
He flips his bomb switch, and a HUGE STEEL BOMB falls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FLIGHT OF THE BOMB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky. The small propeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the arming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core. The bomb wobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins stabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying rate, toward the Arizona.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like matchsticks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next deck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward the powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond comprehension. Over 1400 men die instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine is broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant. Men on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already floating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but there are almost no survivors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship Vestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion snuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris down on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads of men, all sorts of bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does more damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT WARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn runs in, snaps open the cabinet, grabs a bag of morphine sticks, and is about to run out again when she sees the Arizona go up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock wave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an invisible wall. She's trying to cross her arms over her face, and dive to the floor, just as the windows blow out from the concussion, and glass flies over everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAPANESE BOMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see the results of their bomb, and are ecstatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIR ABOVE OAHU - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nose of Danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and he sees the sudden devastation of the Arizona. It is a sight so awesome it freezes him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Zero comes up behind him, firing. Danny jerks his stick to maneuver but he's caught...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe comes in behind the Zero, chopping it up, even as he yells at Danny over the radio --
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't no time for spectatin'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
They turn back after the line of Zeros. There are some Japanese planes coming after them now, but the P-40's head at their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and turn right back into the Japanese formation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a short burst before stopping.

The two P-40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing; Anthony and Red have been pushing the wreckage off the field with the Buick. Danny and Rafe pull the P-40's behind the burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race track; Earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their engines still running.

Earl looks at Rafe's plane, more shot-up and abused than Danny's. Rafe grins and waves to him. Earl mumbles a stream of guttural and unintelligible obscenities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing. One mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes down. Coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut. He, Red, and Anthony reload the machine guns in Rafe and Danny's planes.
</DIRECTION>

Rafe and Danny gun their engines and head back into the air, the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and Earl even coming up with a 12-gauge shotgun to fire at the Zeros as they rush past.

The navy's planes, bunched up on the naval airfield, are destroyed without ever getting into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The harbor is already a mass of destruction and panic; screaming everywhere, men trying to fight fires, move the wounded; the second wave of planes hits, and tremendous explosions now rock the secondary ships like the destroyer SHAW, blasting it apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the Japanese pilots are now having trouble with the thick black smoke coming out of the damaged ships, and off the oil fires along the water. One torpedo plane, its pilot flying blind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to a crash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still, even IN THE CHAOS ON THE SHIPS, the sailors struggle to survive, inventively. Men trapped on one burning ship use the severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to cross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Others jump into the water and swim through the burning oil, towing buddies too wounded to swim themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below decks, sailors have organized a line and are passing ammunition from the ammo lockers, hand to hand up to the guns on deck. Blasts from bombs hit them and ignite the ammo they're holding, setting off a chain reaction of explosions.

The sailors in the boat get strafed, the rounds cutting between them and blasting their boat in two. They jump into the oily water and swim toward shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other sailors are in the water with them, struggling, swallowing the vile black liquid as they battle to swim. Errant bombs and shrapnel hit beside them, killing some; other lose strength and slide beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sailors from the ammo boat make it ashore; it's hot there too, with bullets and bombs all around. One sailor has to stop and puke from the oil; his buddy grabs him and they run for cover; they find it in the dugout of the baseball diamond.

A fire engine from the Honolulu Fire Department races up to the sight of buildings burning from the air attack. As the firemen jump out, a Zero strafes them, gunning down the firemen.

As the strafing Zero starts to bank away, two P-40's come in behind it, both of them gunning away. The Zero comes apart under the barrage, and crashes in a ball of flame.

INT. MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

The once-pristine hospital with its glowing white beds is now a bloody chaos. Every bed is already full; there are burned and broken people on the floor -- soldiers, sailors, civilians, firemen, all mixed in together. People are dying everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging for help. At first we don't see Evelyn, and wonder if she survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own blood dotting her face and arms. The blood of soldiers on her surgical apron. A steel calm has replaced her earlier frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down.

Every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher bearer, medic, iron worker. They fish men from the water, extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships. Everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help, the helpers for more help.

Local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base swimming pool toward the burning ships.

Aides help Roosevelt from the chair, and the press people all see the President struggle on legs that have no strength, to the podium.

	Mr. President, Pearl Harbor caught us because we didn't face facts. This isn't a time for ignoring them again. There are no planes in the entire American arsenal capable of covering the distance to Japan from any land base we control while carrying enough bombs to do any damage whatsoever.

	He's right, Mr. President. The Army has long range bombers, but no place to launch them from. Midway's too far, China is overrun by Japanese forces, and Russia refuses to go to war with Japan and won't allow us to launch a raid from there.

Red reacting to bullets coming through the rear of the fuselage, looks at the brooms protruding from the rear of the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
As the bombardier, navigator, and Red jump onto the other machine guns, Rafe looks for a way out. He dives down toward the city. The Zeros follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIES OVER TOKYO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe takes the B-25 right down among the buildings, sometimes even having to spin the wings to get through. The Zeros can't keep up with this...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into open ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to hide...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Zeros come in to chew him up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they take fire from another B-25 -- Danny's -- coming in to save Rafe's plane. Rafe now uses the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, get the hell out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
But Danny stays, mixing it up with the Zeros; with both B-25's together, their machine guns down one Zero and damage another. But there are too many.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe sees clouds coming in, and fog.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny, run for the clouds!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
The bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the Zeros lose them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIES - BROKEN CLOUDS - DAY

Rafe and Danny keep broken contact through the clouds, and settle in for the long run to China.

<ROOSEVELT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have the planes made it to China?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROOSEVELT>
<GENERAL_MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set. And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_MARSHALL>
<ROOSEVELT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. SEA OF JAPAN - DUSK

They've climbed above the clouds; the fliers are exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is beginning to set. Rafe stares at it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts. Everyone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for each other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a spoon and feeds a badly burned buddy. Evelyn and her overworked nurses are looking after the critical cases. But as she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops for just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays.
</DIRECTION>

</DOOLITTLE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then his engines start to sputter.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOLITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOLITTLE>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the plane on auto-pilot and the men move to the hatches. Three guys go out; it's just Doolittle and his copilot left.
</DIRECTION>
<DOOLITTLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody else is gonna make it either. If I live through this, they're gonna put me in Leavenworth Prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOOLITTLE>
<DIRECTION>
They jump.

<COMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're running out of fuel. And I can't find the beacon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMA>
<DIRECTION>
Danny gestures across to Rafe that he hears nothing in his radio phones. Rafe gestures the same thing back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look down and the entire ground is covered with clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if we're over sea or land. Drop flares and try to spot something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

They drop flares; they disappear into the cloud cover and tell them nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIES - RAFE AND DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's engines are sputtering; his gunner pours the last drops of gas into the tanks.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flash Rafe. We're gonna bail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not unless we know he's over land!

Rafe yells at Danny, as if he could hear --

<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not bailing out into water!

Through a break in the clouds they spot a rocky shoreline.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got coast! Signal him to climb and jump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Red signals; Danny's plane signals back.
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't have fuel to make altitude. He's gonna set it down in the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe looks over at Danny, who is gesturing; he gives up on the hand signals and grabs the flasher; Red reads the Morse code...
</DIRECTION>
<RED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y-O-U... G-O. You go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	N-O! We stay together! I'll go in first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe turns his bomber and Danny follows, their planes arcing down toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking their view, as the altimeter winds down... At the last moment they see rocks looming out of the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's shouting to his crew --
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>

	Hang on tight! I'll put her in the smooth water and we'll swim in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His engines are sputtering, catching, sputtering; he fights to stay in control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHINA COAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface; then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a wall, flipping over it's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANNY'S PLANE is struggling; when he tries to add throttle, the engines sputter out. The plane drops, skips once on the surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danny and Anthony are ejected through the top of the fuselage; Coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose of the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe and Red come to in the plane inverted and sinking. They react, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane is quickly filling. The navigator and gunner are unconscious; the bombardier is dead. Red struggles with the hatch and can't make it budge.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't open til the plane fills!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle to breath as the water envelops them. But as the water reaches the top, Rafe takes a last breath and dives to the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the rest of the crew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHINA COAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They break the surface, and struggle to shore with the unconscious navigator and gunner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's looking everywhere; he sees Danny's plane crashed against the rock. He fights his way through the surf to Danny's plane, Red following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe finds Danny face up in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red finds Anthony on the rock. He's face up, but as Red lifts him he finds the back of Anthony's head is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of Danny's crew are floating in the surf, dead. Rafe and Red pull Danny to shore.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny! DANNY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's eyes flutter open; he sees Rafe and mumbles --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've made better landings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Danny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a V shaped shard of the fuselage hooked into his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts his hands, but he keeps straining. It won't work, He pulls his .45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal. It works a bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again, and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hang on, Danny! You hang on! You're gonna make it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle; a Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived. They're angry, scared, hyped. They knock Red down too, yelling and brandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living and dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Japanese officer is barking orders. They find the Captain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him to a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a wire around his neck. They find the navigator unconscious, but alive. The officer snaps a single word and a soldier shoots the navigator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others wire Rafe's ankles together... Rafe is emotionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAFE'S CONSCIOUSNESS fades in and out. He hears Danny choking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years ago, being carried by the neck across the field by his father...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Rafe sees THE PRESENT: Danny being half-carried, half- dragged by the neck by two Japanese. The officer is pulling Red along, hands bound behind him. And Rafe starts moving, being dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole world slows down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny. And as the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle too. The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when Danny slams him down from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by scythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just arriving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside. Danny lies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his life.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
But Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that moment Rafe thinks he is gone already. Then Danny's eyes drift open, finding him.
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of Evelyn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
The words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief. From somewhere he finds the strength to say --
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. And your baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna be a father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
Did Danny hear? His eyes are closed again. But his head comes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to whisper --
</DIRECTION>
<DANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANNY>
<DIRECTION>
Rafe cradles Danny in his arms. Danny's eyes are open, but Rafe sees no light there.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Danny... Land of the free... Land of the free...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
But Danny will never answer him again. Rafe hugs Danny tight, and weeps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The news of the raid hits Washington...and the rest of America. If it isn't wild celebration; when people see the headline: AIR RAID ON TOKYO, and DOOLITTLE DOES MUCH; their faces change, as if finally told what they already knew -- that America would prevail.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment of America's war with Japan. Before it, America knew nothing but defeat; after it, nothing but victory.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to Vladivostok, Russia, where they were interred for much of the war. Thirteen planes crash landed in China, where the Chinese people helped the Americans escape, and had their villages destroyed and citizens executed by the Japanese forces of occupation. Two crews were captured by the Japanese and three fliers were executed without trial, called "war criminals" by the Japanese. Jimmy Doolittle was promoted to General, and given the medal of honor.
