:SC: THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN: A FLASH OF LIGHT A radiant shiny something dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP. BEGIN TITLES. CAMERA very slowly PULLS BACK. The sparkling surface turns out to be a lot of carats. WE SEE the stone, then the ring, then suddenly, in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS by. REVEAL a mechanical claw above the ring, hanging from a crane. The ring sits in a sea of tiny dolls, joke eyeballs, and other carnival junk. The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it -- accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (O.S.) of hope and disap- pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the slot.

</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
The claw catches the ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS of their FACES as the crane rises. A very pretty lady. A beefy Latino with a two-day beard. Their apprehension. Tommy's confidence. Then his exceptional smile. He gets the ring.

	That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino, lime and no ice, a gin Gibson straight up with ex-tra onions -- I am also fond of de onions -- and a Chardonnary spritzer...also with extra onions -- no, no, do not worry, that is just a little joke. There will be no onions whatsoever in your spritzer!

	Well, y'know Ernie... these days, everyone's down on the political action committees and so-called special interests. But, heck, I think you and Fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you're doing today. I'm in Congress to represent you.

	Come on, Jeff. Look at what you'd be giving up. Going to the best resorts in the world and calling it "official business." Golfing and skiing and fishing, and never picking up a tab.

</RAFE>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his face close to Tommy.
</DIRECTION>
<RAFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you something, Jeff.
	</DIALOGUE>

A tense beat. Then Rafe breaks into a smile.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<TOMMY>

</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
They leave.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we have to have a reception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BUFFET, as Tommy and Loretta help themselves generously to oysters and champagne, they overhear TWO MEMBERS passing by.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_MEMBER>
<SECOND_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_MEMBER>
<FIRST_MEMBER>

</FIRST_MEMBER>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Loretta)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're in the majors, doll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>

THE BALCONY is full of people working one another. As Tommy and Loretta pass some large stone statues, a man extends his hand -- liquor lobbyist KEN KORNGOLD.
</DIRECTION>
<KORNGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congressman? I'd like to introduce myself. Ken Korngold. National Distilled Spirits Association.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORNGOLD>

	</DIALOGUE>

Tommy is along a wall where other guests are similarly occupied.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You now what I love about this place? The way everyone calls you a Member. Every time I hear that, it makes me think of Mr. Happy here.
	</DIALOGUE>

The Member next to him bursts out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhh. Tommy Johnson. Florida. So Iowa -- how'd you get to Washington? You do the crop report on tv?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>

IOWA has a big open face and a flat Midwestern voice.

</IOWA>
<TOMMY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<IOWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	P.O.W. When I got back to Cedar Rapids, I spent so many years telling the Rotary Club what was wrong in Washington, they finally told me to put up or shut up -- so I put up. And here I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IOWA>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. What's wrong in Washington?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<IOWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon -- there's acid rain killing fish, and no one's stopping it... there's topsoil washing away, and no erosion program... there's chemicals in our livestock -- God, I sound like a Boy Scout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IOWA>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's alright, Iowa -- this place could use a few geeks like you.

</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy O'Connor. Soon as I saw how you got elected, I knew you were a real comer. Hell, I bet old Olaf Andersen voted for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNOR>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Olaf Andersen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>

O'Connor points. ON THE DAIS, Andersen is engrossed with Dodge.
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	I won't tell him you asked. Chairman of Gulf Coast Power. Constituent of yours, client of mine.

</O_CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<O_CONNOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pays the rent, know what I mean? Say, could I host a little welcome- to-Washington thing for you down at my law firm? Meet some of my clients, five hundred a head -- you could pick up twenty, twenty-five grand to get you started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_CONNOR>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(cautious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</TOMMY>
<O_CONNOR>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy inspects the sea of barracudas.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people you see not only provided tonight's hospitality. They are the people you serve. That's our system of checks and balances at its best. Their support helped get you elected... your work will help them... and their support will help you in your next campaign, which I remind you is already less than two years away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ADIRONDACKS - LARGE DOORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g., the Capitol dome. As Tommy and Loretta leave, they pass Dick Dodge, who is saying goodnight to guests. He stops them.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Mr. Johnson, it's customary for new Members to pay a courtesy call on the old fogies in the leadership. Especially from their HOME STATE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I would have, but I just got to town. It's an honor to meet you, sir. A real privilege. This is Miss Loretta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Public liaison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
She pronounces the word so carefully, it sounds lewd.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tommy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could make up for it by having a nightcap with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Loretta)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I have my car take you home?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CAPITOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A darkened hallway. A hand-lettered sign by a door reads COMMITTEE ON POWER AND INDUSTRY. THE CHAIRMAN. MR. DODGE. Tommy and Dodge approach. As Dodge unlocks the door:
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but this ain't no homo shit we up to, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, it's not. But --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thinking, Johnson. I'm impressed by your instincts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - CAPITOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single table lamp lights Dick Dodge's office, reflecting off the velvet drapes, sculpted ceiling, and crystal chandeliers. Tommy and Dodge are in leather armchairs, ties undone. On the table between them, a bottle of Jim Beam. Dodge casts a cool eye on Tommy.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Johnson. Why did you come to Washington?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... of course... it's a chance to do something for my country. I mean, there's the topsoil thing, and acid rain is killing the cattle --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the bullshit, Johnson. I saw how you got elected. Flukes like you are either nutcases or troublemakers. I just want to know which one I have on my hands. Who sent you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one sent me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You pulled off that upset on your own?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(acknowledging modestly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid's got his talents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm impressed, Johnson, I am. But why did you run for Congress?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No bullshit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Opportunity knocks. This town is the fuckin' Yukon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
A stunned silence from Dodge -- then deep and generous laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a refreshing answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs again, richly amused. Tommy joins in the laughter.

Shining in the bright sun.

INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY - ON TOMMY'S DESK
</DIRECTION>

</KORNGOLD>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT TOMMY AND KORNGOLD
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, that's why I'm calling, Ken. You said if I needed some help --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<KORNGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You name it, congressman. Issue papers, testimony, floor speeches --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORNGOLD>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what I have in mind. I was just thinking, wouldn't it be a plus for old Ken Korngold if I was to -- how should I put this -- showcase some of his distillers' products at my reception? You know, like they put Reese's pieces in E.T.? It's called "product placement." People come in, they have a tremendous time, they see your products, they think well of you -- and they think well of me, too. It's good for both of us, Ken. What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<KORNGOLD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a new one on me, but hey, sure, I think we can help you out. Say, while I have you on the line, there was one thing...

</DIRECTION>
<GRANDMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that -- I'm so happy you straightened out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMA>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy smiles ambiguously. As APPLAUSE continues, his eyes roam the room and make contact with Dick Dodge, standing at one of the leadership tables. Tommy winks conspiratorially at him. There's such diabolical glee in it, it even takes Dodge aback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CANNON TOP FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful black woman, 20s, walks briskly down the busy Cannon corridors. CELIA. There's intelligence in her eyes, and fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She makes her way down the corridor, exchanging AD LIB greetings, glancing in at the sedate receptions, and drawing closer to the source of the REGGAE (O.S.) -- Tommy's office. She looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOMMY'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's packed, mainly with men. Everyone has drinks and talks noisily. It looks like a fraternity smoker for lobbyists. MUSIC comes from a boom box. The bar -- a tablecloth over some desks -- is lavishly stocked. So are the bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves. ANGLE ON LORETTA, in a cocktail dress and a HELLO MY NAME IS MISS LORETTA badge, staffing a little table, handing Celia a name-tag. INSERT Celia's hands print CELIA KIRBY. PRO BONO. BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a LOBBYIST.

Tommy steers her aside and takes a roll of soggy, toothpick-impaled herring.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? Where's the cheese?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cheese guy didn't return my call. So I called the guy at the American Smoked Fish Institute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
She points at the food table. There's nothing but a few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring -- one white, one pink. The centerpiece is a large smoked fish, eyes staring accusingly.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's just wonderful. Sixty heavy hitters drop in, and I'm feeding 'em cat food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks off, as Celia comes into view in the doorway behind. Tommy picks her up on his radar.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk about this later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Tommy through the crowd until he reaches Celia.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there. Glad you could make it. So you're... Celia Kirby. That's an extremely beautiful name. For an extremely beautiful woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow! That's smooth. After ten straight hours on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke, that's exactly the kind of line I'm ready to fall for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELIA>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, slow down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just tell me, which one's Congressman Johnson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELIA>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I said... me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CELIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. I see. So tell me, Congressman, just how deep is the shit I'm standing in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CELIA>

EXT. CAPITOL STEPS - DAY

Rep. ELIJAH MARSHALL, 50s, black, and a pain in Dodge's ass, is shaking hands and saying goodbye to some Constituents. Dodge approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard in the steam room you're going to try to screw up my ethics bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not screw up. Amend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Eli, your amendments don't have a chance in hell to pass. My bill isn't perfect, I know, but it'll pass. And the President'll sign it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Isn't perfect"? Dick, your bill's the Incumbents Protection Act! How can you even call it an ethics bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the public wants an ethics bill! So that's what we call it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's got no teeth! It won't change a thing, and you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Eli, you're a politician, too. The less you're going to do about something, the more you have to talk about it. You know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
They start walking.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. We close the bank, we stop the rubber checks, we raise the prices in the barber shop, we stop fixing parking tickets, and abracadabra! We say we've cleaned up Congress. Well, I don't think the American people want what this place has become.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the beauty of it! They must, Eli -- they keep re-electing us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore! This new Congress is full of new faces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I wouldn't read too much into that. A few extra retirements, some redistricting -- nothing more than that. It's still business as usual up here.

</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge takes his glasses from his pocket and wipes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>

	I live in the real world, Eli. Do you? What's unemployment up to in your district? Eight percent? Eight-five?

<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight point six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSHALL>

	Johnson, I'm the chairman of a committee up here called Power and Industry. We've got an open seat, and I was wondering if you'd consider filling it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this good news?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
(tongue in cheek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it is a difficult assignment -- look at what we cover: energy, health, telecommunications, environment... the committee is constantly beset by a swarm of special interests. These are powerful people, they've got all the money in the world, and they're not shy about using it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... this is very good news.

INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy -- mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs. Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt.
</DIRECTION>
<REINHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating dais)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Congressman, welcome to the honey pot. You should be one happy freshman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REINHARDT>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well, I'm not. I'm suspicious. One thing I've learned is, when somebody gives you something for nothing, the nothing ain't nothing. It's something. What is it? Why me?

Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy's shoulders.

	Dodge wants to run for Speaker. And he ain't gonna make it without votes from the black caucus.

Suddenly, Dodge reappears. He throws his arm around Tommy's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy, someone I want you to meet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness table -- BARCLAY "SKEETER" WARBURTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson? Meet the new member of the committee. Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton.

<DIRECTION>
ON THE UPPER DAIS, Dodge gavels...

<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This EPA oversight hearing of the Committee on Power and Industry will come to order. I'd like to welcome our first witness, the distinguished Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency...

Tommy's office walls are now richly hung with plaques, awards, and framed photos. We see he has been named the PESTICIDE COALITION'S Man of the Month. The winner of the NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S Achievement Award. The MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA'S Outstanding Young Legislator. Etc. The liquor is gone. Loretta is at the receptionist's desk. A LOBBYIST enters.

INT. CATACOMBS - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Capitol Hill is actually two worlds: the aboveground buildings that visitors and television cameras see, and the catacombs, the busy tunnels and corridors connecting the congressional office buildings and the Capitol. They're surprisingly unglamorous -- exposed pipes, white- washed brick walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs -- and through them move the legislators and their staffs. And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO DAH. He loves this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the Cashier.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My man.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - HOUSE GYM - NIGHT

A standing poker game among the towel- and robe-clad Members. It's Tommy's shuffle and deal. He is convincingly awkward. A BULLDOG of a man examines his hand, tosses two cards in. He assembles his new hand. Four fives and an ace.

INT. LOBBY OUTSIDE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
It's called "Gucci Gulch." The lobby just outside the doors to the House chamber is pandemonium -- a sea of lobbyists, lawyers, PACmen, Members, and staffers urgently trying to find their masters and signal them thumbs-up or-down. Tommy enters, sweeps the room with his eyes, looking for Reinhardt, shrugs, then goes through the doors onto the floor.

INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY

Armando, defending himself from Mickey, manages to knock her hat off. With the hat comes her (apparently false) pony tail. ON MICKEY. She's bald. Her skull bears the mark of surgery. Everyone stops. It's quiet. Mickey's eyes burn into Tommy's. Then she picks up her hat.

	They call it a "cancer cluster." Oh, at first, none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it, but then we all saw it -- for me, it was when the two-year-old across the street developed a brain tumor, same as Mickey. We looked at everything -- the water, the air, dump sites, insects, you name it. But we didn't have to look that far. It was staring us in the face.

Children playing on swings and seesaws in a small public park. TILT UP. A pair of electric power derricks carrying 225,000-volt lines almost directly overhead. The derricks cast shadows across a nearby school. We SEE the neighborhood. Quite a few FOR SALE signs. A house with a moving sale in progress on the front lawn. ON Tommy taking it all in. With him are Celia and the Jubas.

	Five children in the neighborhood have cancer. One more has precancerous lesions. Pregnant women around here are scared to death.

	This is Mickey's school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<MRS_JUBA>

	Turns out a lot of schools are near power lines. The land's cheap, so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place.

	But isn't the school district responsible?
	</DIALOGUE>

	It's tragic, cancer's a terrible thing, but there's no way you can link it to power lines. Truth is, there's a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket, or a microwave oven, than by those derricks.

</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Listen, Reinhardt, something's come up, and I don't quite know how to handle it. There's a guy from the EPA -- I don't know him -- says he wants to see me. Tonight. Out of the office. Alone, he says. Sound of it makes me nervous. I'd feel better if you were there.

A man waits, alone, in the shadow of a large statue. It's Homer. In a jacket and tie, his stubble shaved off, he looks like a plausible government worker. Tommy and Reinhardt approach.

Homer eyes Reinhardt a moment, then continues.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congressman, I have information I think you may want. It's about something going on at the EPA.

</HOMER>
<TOMMY>

Reinhardt is interested in this. And he admires Tommy's m.o.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. The White House is putting heat on the EPA. They want us to announce a major investigation of the relation between power lines and cancer clusters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<REINHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But didn't the EPA already do a study?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REINHARDT>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but when the draft got to the White House, they didn't like it. So they brought their own scientists in to kill it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did the White House change its mind?

</HOMER>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there new evidence?

</TOMMY>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- their polls have dropped like a rock. They need an issue. This one makes them look good on the environment, and they don't have to spend a penny.

</HOMER>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what good is this to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<HOMER>

	Come on, congressman, in this town, information is currency. And advance information is gold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt nods in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you've got to move fast. Once the White House goes public with this, they can't turn back. If your friends at the power company want to kill this investigation, they'd better do it now. Evening, gentlemen.

Tommy takes him aside. The room empties except for them.

<TOMMY>

	That's allowed?

In a chamber crammed with cables, the Telephone Man listens to a handset. He now sports a gold Rolex on his wrist -- his horse must have come in. Van Dyke, also there, looks at any array of dials and meters, whose hands all suddenly move. Some electronic phone CHIRPS, then the filtered RINGING of a call.

	Proof don't mean shit. We're talking politics. They make a federal case out of power lines, I'm screwed. Whole insurance business is screwed. You know how much cash I'd have to pay out in settlements? Even if I stiffed everybody on claims, the legal fees'd be enough to kill me.
