INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A FACE. A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide with wonder. watching something intently. We HEAR the sounds of the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG COLE'S POV: twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering to his wound.

ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of view, as they steer him away.

YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG COLE'S POV: intermittently visible through a confusion of FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A. SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...

	</DIALOGUE>
</PRISON_P_A_SYSTEM>
<DIRECTION>
COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim corridor. He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS "REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE "DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures, GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ssssst! Jose, what's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow. What there is of it is youthful. He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!
</DIRECTION>
<JOSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Volunteers" again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSE>
<DIRECTION>
JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
</DIRECTION>
<SCARFACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Volunteer duty".

INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.

COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.

INT. SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor, steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock. The heavy door clangs shut behind him. He's alone. COLE'S breath comes quicker now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock. COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks. He looks down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved aside. COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET: a city in moonlight! A surreal image of abandoned buildings. No people anywhere. The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for something. Finds it. An insect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand. As he clumsily inserts it into a collection tube, something makes him turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's something across the street in the dark. Something alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR! Startled by the light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked floor and gets another specimen. DOGSHIT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a different SOUND. GRRRR! A dog. More GRRRRS. More dogs. Then, a YIP. Then, VICIOUS GROWLS. It's a DOGFIGHT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store. A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and puts it into one of his specimen tubes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store. There's nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the building. COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle. Over it is written, "WE DID IT!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: high up on a building across the street, a LION patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.

ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their windowed masks. It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp, dripping walls. From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,
</DIRECTION>
<AMPLIFIED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raise your arms above your head.

COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick plastic in the rusty iron wall. VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk behind the translucent aperture, studying him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts... a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS: an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER, BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST. They represent a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude, outdated, patched-together technologies.

<MICROBIOLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

</MICROBIOLOGIST>
<DIRECTION>
COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We want you to tell us about last night.

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves, COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall. One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!" Another features a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on) and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".

INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY

THE DREAM AGAIN! But at an earlier moment. YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse leading to the departure gates.

Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the monotonous airport routine. As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PONYTAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WATCH IT!

YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running. A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strikingly "real" world of bright colors. Extravagant paintings adorn the walls. A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty seated on folding chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<POET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still among the myriad microwaves, the infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally small, byte-sized now, tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us, "We are no other than a moving row Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold In Midnight by the Master of the show."
	</DIALOGUE>
</POET>
<DIRECTION>
As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS. Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty- eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses. She's KATHRYN RAILLY. And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS. BEEP! BEEP!

</POET_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BEEP! BEEP! Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the beeper and rises, embarrassed. As she makes her way to an exit, the glaring POET continues...
</DIRECTION>
<POET>

Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name.

RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: a MAN, his back to her, in strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".

</RAILLY>
<COLE>

	I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?

(slightly confused)

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, 1995 is the past.

COLE looks stunned.

INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you taking me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<POLICEMAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	South of France, buddy. Fancy hotel. You're gonna love it.

	South of France?! I don't want to go to the South of France. I want to make a telephone call.

POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.

<POLICEMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink with your act, but you don't fool us.
	</DIALOGUE>

Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen prisoners, crawls through a busy street. The Police Department logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future. COLE stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants, PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and starts inspecting his scalp...
</DIRECTION>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you got any creepy crawlies.

</BILLINGS>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it easy, relax into things. We all gonna get along fine if you just relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<DIRECTION>
COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the large room. His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where light pours in from outside. Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON, a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeffrey. Yo! Jeffrey. This here is James. Whyncha show James around? Tell him the TV rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(with a sly look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much you gonna pay me? Huh? I'd be doing your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<BILLINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five thousand dollars, my man. That enough? I'll wire it to your account as usual, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLINGS>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Billings. Five thousand. That's enough. Five thousand dollars. I'll give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel good, we're all pals. We're prisoners, they're the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the games. Games vegitize you. If you play the games, you're voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting, THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd they give you? Thorazine? How much? Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to make a telephone call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly sly and confidential)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon. But that's not why you're here. Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's the TV. It's all right there. Commercials. We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? You're mentally ill! That's a fact! If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting hysterical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...

</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, Jeffrey. Be calm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and continues, completely calm now. But COLE isn't listening. He's mesmerized by the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if you want to watch a particular program, say "All My Children" or something, you go to the Charge Nurse and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on. But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on. There was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played. He couldn't quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't just make it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, more and more people are being defined now as mentally ill. Why? Because they're not consuming on their own. But as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care. And this gives the so-called sane people work!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hysteria again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHOOO! SHOCK THERAPY! GROUP THERAPY! HALLUCINATIONS! THERAPEUTIC DRUGS! IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG! PERFECT! THE SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh. I got "carried away". Explaining the workings of...the institution.

Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<TJ_WASHINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't really come from outer space.

<TJ_WASHINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mock me, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cole)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a condition of "mental divergence". I find myself on another planet, Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though it's a totally convincing reality in every way...I can feel, breathe, hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TJ_WASHINGTON>

The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.

INT. PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a place for crazy people! I'm not crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him. (Some of the DOCTORS bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)
</DIRECTION>
<RESIDENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't use that term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESIDENT_1>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you've got some real nuts in here! Listen to me, all of you -- I have to tell you something that's going to be difficult for you to understand, but...

</COLE>
<DR_RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James...please. These are all doctors here and we want to help you.

	Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr. Railly you thought it was...

	<DIALOGUE>
	1995. ... How about right now? Do you know what year it is right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_FLETCHER>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	1989. Look, I'm not confused. There's been a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE is just grabbing a pad and pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.

</COLE>

FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.

COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Cole...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_CASEY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. I guess you wouldn't, this is 1989, they're probably not active yet. That makes sense! Okay. Listen to me, three billion people died in 1995. Three billion, got that? Almost the whole population. Of the world! Only about one percent survived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
DOCTORS exchange knowing looks. This is an old story, apparently.

<RESIDENT_2>

	Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RESIDENT_2>
<COLE>

<DIRECTION>
(sees their eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe me. You think I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy. I'm a convict, sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as sane as anyone in this room. I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil. COLE'S seen that tapping before -- in the future! It disorients him.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you tell us the name of the prison you've come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE doesn't answer. He's staring at the tapping pencil.

<DR_FLETCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_FLETCHER>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering, new tack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.

</COLE>
<DR_FLETCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_FLETCHER>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DR_FLETCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_FLETCHER>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called, "voice mail". I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RESIDENT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"From the present." We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole?

	No, 1995 is the past, too. Look...

Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.

Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER lunges for the phone, answers sharply...

A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand. Sympathetically, RAILLY takes it from him.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't who you expected?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>

COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset. Nuts?

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was some lady. She didn't know anything.

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.

RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest. It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.

RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.

	NOOOOOOOOOO!

The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak. The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure. It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured. He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out! Then, DAZZLING LIGHT. Everything goes white!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward. Disoriented. Which world is this? The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING, occasional MOANS. He can barely discern the shadowy figures of an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single tree. Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.

Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can remove the grill but you can't. It's welded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE checks the grill anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? I toldja. And all the doors are locked, too. They're protecting the people on the outside from us. But the people outside are as crazy as us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill. He's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden SOUND. Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING, SNORES, occasional MOANS. Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off.

	You know what "crazy" is? "crazy" is "majority rules". Take germs for example.

Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Germs?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!

As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to figure out where to put the SPIDER.

	So cut to the 20th century! Last week in fact, right before I got dragged into this hellhole. I order a burger in this fast food joint. The waiter drops it on the floor. He picks it up, wipes it off, hands it to me...like it was all okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
No alternative. COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on...
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"What about the germs?" I say. He goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<JEFFREY>

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<JEFFREY>

	Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.

</COLE>
<JEFFREY>

	I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS!

PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.

<JEFFREY>

	Sorry. Really sorry. Got a little agitated. The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...

COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.

ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just completed the puzzle stares, very upset.

Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY is sending a message to him. COLE looks at the ward door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter. One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.

ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating. He locks at the door...blurring in and out of focus. He looks down at the key in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES. JEFFREY resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key. It won't turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<PATIENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Place to go would be...Florida. The keys are lovely this tine of year.

COLE pauses, stares, not understanding. Then, he opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room facing several elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even lock up from the magazine he's reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his back is to the SECURITY MAN. But he doesn't know how to control this elevator. What should he do?
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

	Two's not working today. Use one.

<DIRECTION>
COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: the SECURITY MAN continues his reading. He's a big guy with reading glasses perched on his nose. He looks exactly like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, an elevator door slides open. The elevator's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE steps into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator springs to life. The numbers on the indicator over the door start to rise. 7...8...9.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at him. They seem to expect him to exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.

RAILLY has just arrived for work. She's slipping on her white doctor's coat when...

Stunningly quiet. We are on a placid campus looking at the dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall. MOVING IN we FOCUS ON a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995".

A large screen dominates the auditorium stage. On the screen is a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained by PEASANTS. The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to the accounts of local officials at that time, this gentleman, judged to be about forty years of age, appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge in the West of England in April of 1162. Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent, the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence which he predicted would wipe out humanity in approximately 8OO years. Deranged and hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the village, was taken into custody, but then mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern in a pool of light. She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.

	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons of great pestilence, men have often believed the prophecies of crazed fanatics, that the end of the world was come." Obviously, this plague/doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling when reality supports it in some form, whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox, or AIDS. In addition to these "natural" contagions, there are now technological horrors as well: besides radiation, consider our lurking fear of germ warfare and its close approximation, chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head in the deadly mustard gas attacks during the First World War.

	-- who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the lines where Doctors discovered he had lost all comprehension of French but spoke English fluently, albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize. The man, although physically unaffected by the gas, was hysterical. He claimed he had come from the future, that he was looking for a pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the earth in the year... 1995!

	I think, Dr. Railly, you have given your alarmists a bad name. Surely there is very real and very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race: proliferation of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding habits, the rape of the environment, the pollution of land, sea, and air. In this context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little" represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?

COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his impulse. He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons. He pulls a razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.

Startled, COLE turns to face them.

The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK! The FIRST THUG smacks COLE hard across the face with something metallic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S cheek. It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.

RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks her roughly to the ground.

The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his foot for a second kick when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him. The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed. The SECOND THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for the dropped pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw. The FIRST THUG'S head whips back. SNAP! He collapses against the brick wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley as fast as he can stagger.

RAILLY stares up at COLE. He looks very dangerous. He glances in her direction as he pockets the pistol.

COLE looks startled. It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in here. Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bookshelves line two walls. The front window is blanked cut with posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings, photos of animal atrocities. The fourth wall features the counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.
</DIRECTION>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, can we help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<DIRECTION>
COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets an urgent warning.
</DIRECTION>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. You looking for something in particular?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S eyes follow her look. It's a tape recorder underneath a sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY. "We have a problem!" the look says. MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know anything about any "Army of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't you and your friend disappear, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just need some information...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you hear me? We're not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE is pointing a pistol at them. A TIGER SNARLS.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James, no -- don't hurt them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the activists)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do whatever he tells you to do. He's... upset -- disturbed. Please -- he's dangerous -- just cooperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.
</DIRECTION>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want -- money? We only have a few bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<DIRECTION>
COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again. A BABOON HOWLS with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snaps at Railly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock the door!

	James, why don't we...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock it now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<FALE>

INT. FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement. They're very frightened, eager to cooperate.
</DIRECTION>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big star -- the media latch on to him because he's picketing his own father, a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist". You musta seen all that on TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't watch TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while RAILLY watches helplessly. Suddenly, COLE finds something he thinks he's seen before. He holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this him -- Dr. Mason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.
</DIRECTION>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<BEN>

	What are you going to do with us?

</BEN>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(stares at the photo, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me more about Jeffrey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<FALE>
<DIRECTION>
(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do...picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff. He said we were, "ineffectual liberal jerkoffs". He wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to "educate" the public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<DIRECTION>
COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.
</DIRECTION>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's when he let a hundred snakes loose in the Senate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we weren't into that kind of stuff. It's counter productive, we told him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he and eleven others split off and became this underground..."army"
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They started planning a "Human Hunt".
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They bought stun guns and nets and bear traps. They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they didn't do it. They didn't do any of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<FALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He goes on TV, gives a news conference, tells the whole world he just realized his daddy's experiments are vital for humanity and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey Mason, from now on, is going to personally supervise the labs to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer.

EXT. FREEWAY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with bumper stickers and painted slogans. "I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS"... "FREE THE ANIMALS"..."WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?"
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't just barge in on a famous scientist. They'll have security guards, gates, alarm systems. It's insane, James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVING FORD/FREEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROLODEX CARD with an address on "Outerbridge Road" for "Jeffrey Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason" rests on a map spread across COLE'S lap. COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel, maneuvering in heavy traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If those young men don't get loose, they could die in that basement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What's three more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, carefully, a new tack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE is studying the map again.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy was a total fruitcake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- he said his father was "God"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open highway. COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well. As the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside. An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE intones over the RADIO...
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This just in: police are widening their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly, prominent psychiatrist and author. Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has been abducted by escaped mental patient, James Cole. The two are believed to be traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura, license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain. She feels so badly for him. She wants to help him. She says, tenderly...
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can't go on, James. You're not well. You're burning with fever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need gas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you didn't know how to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with your leg?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shot! Who shot you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>

</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY remain in the car. She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(sees the credit card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That has your name on it. Give him cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY starts opening the door. Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience Store appended to the Gas Station.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can come with me. I have to get some things. Scissors, bandages, some alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look at your leg, James. I'm a doctor.

COLE looks helpless, hesitant. She's in charge...for the moment.

EXT. CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)

COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door. He's staring up at the sun and the sky. RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't put your weight on it. You need stitches and antibiotics. Lucky for you it was near the surface.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>

RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket while COLE continues staring up at the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>

A beat. COLE tries to stand up.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- let me help you.

</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet. A beat. They're very close. They don't move. RAILLY looks like she can barely breathe.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You smell so good.

A beat. The spell is broken. He reaches for his pants, then turns back to her, suddenly grim.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to do something now. Something I don't want to do. I'm so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes. He looms over her. He's cold now, steeled.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>

	I have a mission. It's important.

RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.

A formal dinner for forty. Desert has been served. DR. MALCOLM MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself, with no sense of purpose. But alas, I am "burdened" with the sense that with all this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise, there comes great responsibility. Indeed, I practically feel a soapbox growing under my feet whenever I stand for more than a few seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>

While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.

(cont.)

	But never before, not even at Los Alamos when the scientists made bets on whether their first atomic bomb test would wipe out New Mexico, has science given us so much reason to fear the power we have at hand.

</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Current genetic engineering as well as my own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as any...

</DR_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room, grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.

<JEFFREY>

	This is ridiculous. My father is making a major address.

INT. HALLWAY/MASON MANSION

The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.

<AGENT_3>

COLE is astonished. The AGENTS are, too.

	Of course I know him. What do you think -- I act like this to strangers? Listen -- you fellas are terrific. I thought you were pulling a number on me. What a terrible thing if you'd thrown old Arnie out. I owe you guys the big apologia! Mea culpa, fellas.

JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.

<AGENT_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Arnie?"

</AGENT_4>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone. Used to be my best friend. Still is. What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds? No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry? Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig. Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.

The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.

JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.

	Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" You do remember that, don't you?

AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.

COLE is like a trapped animal. He's being led down the staircase now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.

SMASH. The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and accelerates right at him!

Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.

COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.

Total blackness! The sound of keys in the lock.

He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.

	I'm..."mentally divergent". I would love to believe that.

ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground. An insect! He reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass, stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face. The HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.

ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.

	I'd like to be clear about this. That man and the other one were..."severely" beating us. James Cole didn't start it. In fact -- he saved me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<LIEUTENANT_RALPERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist -- why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were?

EXT. FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY, amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting. He shakes his head wearily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with amazement, too. They include...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the TEENAGED PUNKS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS, reacting at the sight of RAILLY. It's COLE! He pushes toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathryn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes urgent charge of the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning, looking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(placing his hands on his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry -- it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more! I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me. I want to get well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James -- put your hands down and listen to me. Things have changed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike: she tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull him along...but COLE isn't moving. He's staring at the front of the FAA Store with disbelief!
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James, come on! We have to get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk, then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENTION_POLICE_ARE_WATCHING IS_THERE_A_VIRUS_IS_THIS_THE SOURCE_THREE_BILLION_DIE>
<DIRECTION>
It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen that...before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James, trust me. We're in terrible trouble. We have to run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past ONLOOKERS. She looks crazier than he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost colliding with a passing car. BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.

ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.

	Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.

</BEN>
<FALE>

	Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.

<DIRECTION>
(indicating Jeffrey to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<FALE>
<DIRECTION>
(triumphant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how come she knows what's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FALE>
<DIRECTION>
JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's my theory on that. While I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health. I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied thoroughly. Then, everything about me was entered into a computer where they created a model of my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY. Is he serious? Is he crazy? Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, using the computer model, they generated every thought I could possibly have in the next, say ten years, which they then filtered through a probability matrix to determine everything I was going to do in that period. So you see, she knew I was going to lead the Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the pages of history before it ever even occurred to me. She knows everything I'm ever going to do before I know it myself. How about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I have to get going -- do my part. You guys check all this stuff out and load up the van. Make sure you have everything. I'm outta here.

EXT. SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES COP'S eyes searching everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV: the POLICE CAR passes from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James! Come on.

</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster, bits of lettuce in his hair.

	You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before... I...I...dreamed them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>

But she's not listening. She's peeking out the alley entrance.

RAILLY'S POV: across the street is a run-down skid row hotel, THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.

INT. GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often, stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DESK_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty five bucks an hour.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's ninety eight. For the night. Deal?

</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events. Then, he turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DESK_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty four. Fourth floor, turn right. Elevator's busted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DESK_CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb stairs. As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone, punches a number, speaks into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DESK_CLERK>

COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY pace back and forth like a mad woman.

<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was in...prison again.

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like that? You were in prison?

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said.

	You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?

<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE looks at her. She's really upset.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV show and copied it. Listen, you were right, it's all in my head. I'm mentally ill, I imagine all that stuff. I know they're not real, I can trick them, make them do what I want. I just worked on them in my head and I got back here. I can get better. I can stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does this mean to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I had a dream about...something like that.

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE stands, moves close to her.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be here. In this time. With you. I want to become...become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(sudden hopeful idea!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not holding. A menacing figure stands in the doorway. WALLACE. A wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my territory, bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused, turns to Railly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this real -- or is this one of my delusions?

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is definitely real:

<DIRECTION>
(to Wallace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I think we have a little misunderstanding here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face. She flies back against the wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you -- some kind of tough guy? You wanna be a hero? You gonna try and mess with me? Come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's a smart boy. But you, honey, you think you can go 'round me and peddle your fancy ass in this part of town, you bet your life we got what I would call a major goddamn misunderstandin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a twig! The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JAMES -- DON'T!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
COLE hesitates.

(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to rob him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I...We need cash, James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow. RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...
</DIRECTION>
<SHOUTS>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're killing him! Call the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHOUTS>
<DIRECTION>
Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two are crazy. I got friends. You put me in a closet, they're gonna be really pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLACE>
<DIRECTION>
COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.
</DIRECTION>

RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.

<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>

COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want them to find me. Ever. I don't want to go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the choice he's made. Given up the future (if it exists, and it's looking like it does)! Risking his life to be with her! For this brief time! She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears welling in her eyes. But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.

Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into their doorways.

EXT. GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY

COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead. They come to the end of the metal stairway. It's a long distance to the ground. COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lets herself down to him. Their eyes meet. He holds her in his arms for a moment. Then, reluctantly, he puts her down. They start running down the alley.
</DIRECTION>

INT. GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY

The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall alongside the open doorway to Room 44. The UNIFORMED OFFICERS are backing him up, weapons drawn.

EXT. BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the toney downtown shopping district. Among them, RAILLY looks furtively left and right, COLE on her heels. She's hidden her bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody handkerchief to his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling city, the tall downtown buildings. His eyes go up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: a building, towering toward the sky. A building with a ledge. The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed entrance to a store.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here. I'm going to try that phone number. Let's hope it's nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES looming frighteningly close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display window. Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window. Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand. Confused, COLE stares at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him, eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James! James! It's okay. We're insane! We're crazy!

</COLE>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You... you left them a message?

</COLE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth! He starts to recite...
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys -- they're the ones who are going to do it. I can't do anything more. The police are watching me."
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
Now she's stunned. She glances back and sees the phone booth twenty yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... you couldn't have heard me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got your message, Kathryn. They played it for me. It was a bad recording...distorted. I didn't recognize your voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic. Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him into the CROWD.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
But COLE'S not here. He's a short distance away...staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLE'S POV: aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of brand new consumer goods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and full of moldering merchandise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess that's it.

<CLERK>

(producing Wallace's roll of bills)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I'll pay cash.

The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among them, all wearing black. Some of them have climbing gear, tool belts, all sorts of paraphernalia. KWESKIN is telling his story.
</DIRECTION>
<KWESKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So then he goes into this incredible riff about how his shrink, like, replicated his brain while he was in the nut house. Turned it into a computer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KWESKIN>
<WELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Fale believed it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WELLER>
<KWESKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you know Fale! He's like, "If you guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will -- I never saw you before in nay life!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</KWESKIN>
<DIRECTION>
LAUGHTER from all of them. Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POPE quickly slides the door open. It's JEFFREY...grinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's do it!

EXT. VAN/FREEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a flashlight and goes over "the plan" with the other ACTIVISTS.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's Stage One. In Stage Two, Monkey Four is over here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.
</DIRECTION>
<GOINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the harm in opening the bag? His eyes are taped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOINES>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<ICHIOKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why should we be like him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ICHIOKA>
<DIRECTION>
Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want the full effect?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeffrey? I know it's you, Jeffrey. I recognize your voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JEFFREY??? ... Very well. You're out of your mind, Jeffrey. I know all about your insane plan. That woman -- your psychiatrist -- she told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
JEFFREY raises his eyebrows. This he hadn't expected.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy even for you. But, just in case, I took steps to make sure you couldn't do it. I took myself out of the loop! I don't have the code any more. I don't have access to the virus. So, go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract anything of use to yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...virus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DR_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
(spins his head toward Jeffrey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What virus are we talking about, Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're insane, Jeffrey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DR_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MASON>
<JEFFREY>

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward. It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods. SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE (KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a redwood tree. We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
(up on the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a cross section of one of the old trees that's been cut down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say, "BIRTH OF CHRIST", "DISCOVERY OF AMERICA", "MAGNA CARTA SIGNED", "1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS", and "1930 TREE CUT DOWN".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELINE>
<DIRECTION>
(up on the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere in here I was born. And here -- I die. There's only a moment for you. You don't notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MADELINE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the theater. WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, let me help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(fussing with his upper lip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving his head to see the film)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flowers! What flowers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an expression. Here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we doing this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears in her eyes. They discomfit COLE.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.

EXT. GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS. Then, METAL ON METAL. Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen with phony rocks. Stalking back and forth. Huge. Upset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANK. CLANK. METAL ON METAL. GRUNTS of effort, then, DR. MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MASON_S_VOICE>

EXT. PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LION'S PEN/ZOO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR. From the darkness, unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AVIARIES/ZOO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS continue. Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie filling his field of vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV: the MOVIE SCREEN. TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around. Empty seats on both sides of him. He's alone. He panics.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>

	Kathryn?!

<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock Festival". PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone. Turning, she reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses. She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM! Crossing the lobby toward the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate in the tight dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip. The BLONDE MAN stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNETTE>
<DIRECTION>
The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional, revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe. The Blonde Man is COLE! He's confused.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you look pretty different, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(studies him seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes lock. Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room. She kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other janitorial items. COLE responds to her passion as they move deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters. Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood. The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than reality. Did we really see him at all?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished building, deserted in the early morning light. High up, a MONKEY his head around a girder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. For a long moment. Then, an AFRICAN BULL ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING

A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is at the wheel of the cab.

COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_CABBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta the zoo last night. Then they locked up this big shot scientist in one of the cages. Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_CABBIE>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_CABBlE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they got animals all over the place. Buncha zebras shut down the thruway 'bout an hour ago and some kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got traffic blocked for miles over on 22.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_CABBlE>
<DIRECTION>
Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.
</DIRECTION>
<RAILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they were up to! Freeing animals!

</RAILLY>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."

(o.s.)

Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.

RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it, includes it with several magazines she's holding. She doesn't notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and frowns. It's getting late and where's Cole? She turns, heads for the cash register to make her purchases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already. He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paper features a banner headline..."ANIMALS SET FREE" and a sub head..."PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE" over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, RAILLY frowns. Does she know this man?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do! He's DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops a bundle of newspapers at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAILLY'S POV: the front page shows a photo of three frightened GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS CREATE CHAOS". Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.

COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.

ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS (whose faces remain out of view). He can't help sneaking another look back.
