</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant. Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough. At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds flat.

CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red, Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves. He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made. Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to 1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and spends money as fast as he makes it.

MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house. He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you.

among the structures housing the ballasts for the lights. The ROAR of a 757's 95,000 lbs. of thrust beats an him. He spins to protect his face. His clothes and hair are whipped. As he runs to us ...

HANNA POV: UP INTO LIGHTS SEARCHING FOR NEIL. SUDDENLY:

is there. His .45 is up, centered into Hanna's face. He's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of strobes.

NEIL

The hammer drops. Nothing. His .45 misfires.

HANNA

<DIRECTION>
FIRES THREE perfectly controlled, hammered-on SHOTS. His front sight barely moved.

<DIRECTION>
NEIL

<DIRECTION>
HIT THREE TIMES in the chest - is blown back into the racks of lights. He lies still.

HANNA

approaches, slowly. His gun hand drops to his side.

<DIRECTION>
WIDE: NEIL + HANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neil's on the ground, his back against the rack. One arm is in his lap. The other is flung over the top bar of the strobe rack. Neil looks at Hanna and gestures with his hand. Hanna takes it. Neil holds on tight.

Then Neil's eyes dim. And he dies.

LONG REAR SHOT: HANNA + NEIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of them stay there like that.

THE END
