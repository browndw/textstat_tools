INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
The dumpster lid opens on a bitterly cold, gray winter's day in an Alaskan city. A chunky, shivering HAIR STYLIST with jet black bangs shakes out a box of conditioning samples.

INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dumpster lid BANGS shut, reopens a beat later. A moment of calm until two garbage bags SLAM against the inside of the lid. It falls shut with a CLANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lid reopens. Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life. A middle aged MAN in work clothes checks to make sure he's alone. He gently lowers the lid, opens it again a moment later, this time balancing a mini-bar fridge on his shoulder. He dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off.

The lifeless body of a fair-sized man comes CRASHING into the garbage. SIRENS closer. A man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull some garbage over the corpse. A second man looks in, then pulls the first man away.

Black. The dumpster reopens. Morning now. A Korean-American TEENAGER wearing an apron and headphones sings along to an old KISS tune as he deposits two large orange garbage bags.

<TEENAGER>

	"...Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet, get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat...gonna lose your mind in..."

He shuts the lid with care. Black.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cookie-cutter subdivision. Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that blankets the neighborhood. HOWARD (30s), a burly outdoors type, is trying to unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup. TED WATTERS (late 20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street. He stops by Howard's driveway.

A group of office WORKERS look on, very much impressed, as a stunned Howard stares at the camera.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard, you seem like a reasonable kind of guy. Lets you and me talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON: WATTERS at his nearby cubicle, typing frenetically on his computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first, he appears to be working, until we realize that on his computer screen pixilated Zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail of bullets. A Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the tape finishes, a smattering of APPLAUSE from his colleagues. Ted gives a small wave over the cubicle wall.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>

CAM (30s), Native-American Alaskan walks over. Ted immediately hits a key that turns the screen to a spread-sheet.

	That was really cool. It was like... watching "Cops".

	I've been hearing that for 13 months and six days, Cam. After a while, it gets a little old.

<DIRECTION>
(off Cam's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>

Good enough. Cam moves off. Back to the zombie blood bath. The phone RINGS. Ted picks up, his eyes never wavering from the gore intensive computer game.

We PULL BACK to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life spent on the edge of the wilderness; citations from the Rotarians, pictures of sponsored hockey teams... We are --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK BRANCH (50s), a mid-level management type sits across from PAUL BARNELL (40s), a mild-mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit. Paul takes in the display. The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's... quite the fish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Branch is about to answer when Ted enters with a slim file.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul Barnell, Ted Watters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
Handshakes. Paul makes steady eye contact. Ted notices.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life insurance policy.

</DIRECTION>
<TED>

	Raymond, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Raymond. You see, as I've already explained to Mr. Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and I thought it might be time to... move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By move on you mean...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BRANCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...cash in Raymond's policy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
Ted smiles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive. My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after each other if anything should ever happen. And to be frank, money's a little --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand Mr. Barnell, but here's the thing. With no actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion. So, even though your brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's really very little we can do for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted flips the file shut. Case closed. Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's demeanor, forces a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.

EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The city skyline rises in the distance as heat vents belch steam against the rapidly setting sun. But that's miles away. Here on the outskirts is a rapidly failing five store strip mall; a "Porn-a-copia" XXX Video store, hair stylist, small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the "Barnell Great Escapes" travel agency. We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner. Paul's car, a Ford Taurus, pulls onto the parking pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul driving, talking on his cell phone and balancing a big non-spill metallic travel coffee mug at the same time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, hang on. First off, how did you get my cell number?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's for mechanical and medical emergencies only.

Paul, wound up, taps his brakes too hard. His mug falls, the lid pops and the coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers.

	Great.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE THE DUMPSTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black. Paul opens the lid. The phone is cradled in his neck, he checks each soggy page to make sure he's not tossing anything important.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I don't know. I, I, I have no clue. Could it possibly be a problem on your end? So the electric company never makes a... Look, I pay my bills. I'm a Rotarian for goodness --

<DIRECTION>
Paul looks over to see some MEN from Rodney's Repo Ranch walking up to the front door of his office. Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls into the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, muttering, leans in to get it. He pushes aside an orange garbage bag, guided by the faint sound of the other person STILL TALKING. And then--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL'S POV: of THE BODY-- a 40-ish White (well, a little blue) male dressed in a cheap suit. Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is talking.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Barnell? Mr. Barnell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_CELL_PHONE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOUT as Paul jumps back from the dumpster. The lid CRASHES down as he scrambles/slides away. He takes a moment to compose himself, then realizes his phone is still in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and hurries off. The lid CRASHES shut.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(into the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

<DIRECTION>
Hung up. Paul dials 911, looks back at the dumpster, thinks for a second, then hits END. He stands there, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the dumpster. He can't take his eyes off it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and walking toward the door. He's oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the sound of a TRUCK, his head snaps around. It's a garbage truck, but instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road. That's all it takes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul backs his Ford Taurus up to the dumpster, pops the trunk, checks to make sure he's alone then steps up on the rear bumper, opens the lid and clambers inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE A FRIDGE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black. The fridge door opens, the light revealing several cans of pop and beer in the foreground. Behind the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
beverages, a garage where Paul struggles with the lifeless body. He props the man against the hood of his car, gives him a quick once over, pockets, obvious wounds. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul moves to the fridge, starts to pull things out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTACHED SUBURBAN GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jodie, an annoyingly small dog, enters the garage from the house and starts sniffing around the body. A new chew toy!
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(at the sound)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jodie, no! Not for dogs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He SHOOS the dog back into the house. Paul moves back to the fridge, opens the door and, with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him inside. Only problem...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's legs don't want to fit. Paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative appendage. He grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee. It SNAPS sideways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul fights nausea. But with the leg now out of joint, the man fits. Paul, breathing heavy, leans against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK then. OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles. Then, just before he shuts the door, Paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9 (the coldest setting).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A padlock and chain come from the base of a propane BBQ. It goes around the fridge, the lock SNAPS it in place. Paul spots some leftover drink cans. He kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.

Ted checks out various radio stations, hating everything. He lands on one playing "Escape (The piña Colada Song)" when he looks up and suddenly jams on the brakes.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted car slides toward a moose that has wandered into the middle of the road. The car stops about five feet away.

The moose looks at Ted. Ted looks back, wondering what he ever did to deserve the life he's stuck with. After a moment, the moose lumbers off. Ted drives on.

A telephone cord runs from the computer to the headset of TIFFANY (20s), pert, smart and dressed in a tight University of Alaska T-shirt. Tiffany sits with her feet up on the desk as she flips through a copy of "Cosmo".

It's a medium sized apartment, littered with guy stuff although bowing to advancing signs of feminine influence.

</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our only relationship problem is you're running a $1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.

</TIFFANY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>

</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Tiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<TIFFANY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel someone you really care about, maybe even the love of your life, is being a real pain. Now I need you to concentrate...

Ted pretends to do just that, drawing a giggle from Tiffany before he walks off.

INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul tries to open the front door, but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow. Three good yanks and it finally opens. He enters the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faded travel posters cover the walls. AVIS (40s), a career office gal, smiles at her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha Airlines. It features a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell. The shell juts out of the display giving it a 3-D quality.
</DIRECTION>
<AVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning Mr. Barnell. Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks Avis. Looks good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Was November this bad last year?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AVIS>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk about? Did you send the computer back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Paul moves to his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it was not working. Any calls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric. I told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some people don't like to listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot, then at a photo of his wife Margaret on his desk. He mentally gathers himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something... strange happened last night Avis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The one who went missing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. Well anyway last night there's a knock on the door and there's Raymond, just... standing there on the doorstep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Avis arrives with the coffee and the mail.
</DIRECTION>
<AVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you have him declared...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead? No. I mean, they said he hadn't been gone long enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling warmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good thing in hindsight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it. Lots of bills, most marked past due. He finds a "pre- approved" credit card application, sets it to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<AVIS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where was he all these years?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AVIS>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lower 48. Said he wanted to get away from the cold.

Paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the Hawaii display. He keys on the shell.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Florida.

	I've got an aunt down there. Where 'bouts?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A uh... small place. By the beach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's great. You and Mrs. Barnell will have some company for a bit I guess. How is she?

INT. BARNELL HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET BARNELL (early 40s) stands in a plush bathrobe and slippers. Despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the front door, opening it on -- a young wholesome PAPERBOY smiling through the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<PAPERBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAPERBOY>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker. I'll get my purse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
The paperboy, unfazed, smiles as Margaret walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<PAPERBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's 12 dollars. I missed you last time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAPERBOY>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerk off... OK, jerk off, uhhuh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret gives the paperboy his money, the stamp card plus a dollar tip, then tweaks his nose. Twice.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say hi to your slut Mom for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<PAPERBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure will. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAPERBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He trots down the walk as Margaret shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lid opens. GARY and JIMBO (30s), check to insure they're not being watched. Gary, slightly effeminate, leans into the bin and BURROWS through the garbage. Jimbo, a bear of man, keeps watch. He's nervous, a little out of sorts.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought stuff didn't smell when it was frozen? I don't know why we have to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets visual confirmation. We have a chance to move up here, so let's just--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like the guy's not gonna end up in a land- fill, anyway. You ever ask Dave what he did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd snap his neck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops, he did it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Jimbo not getting it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The song? From that girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Gary, HUMMING now, keeps digging, finding nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how'd it feel? I mean, not when you did it, but, like now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
Gary hops inside as his actions become more frantic. Still no luck. He stands.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimbo glares at his partner.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serious. He's gone. Maybe he wasn't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even joke. Maybe the trash was emptied.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks pretty full. Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ducking down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a little fridge down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(standing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we would have shot him at least we'd know for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was following orders. And if you hadn't started a screaming match, no one would have called the cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying... maybe you didn't break it all the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
(walking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and he just looked dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It - was - BROKEN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
Gary, embarrassed, digs in the trash with his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret, still in her bathrobe, walks to the fridge. As she puts her hand on the latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tugs on the door. It opens just a crack before the chain stops it. The frozen head peeks through the slight gap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way. She gives the door a hip check. The door latches shut while something frozen and brittle inside CRACKS. Margaret, oblivious, walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN OVEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chicken sits in a pan, the rest of the room visible behind it through the oven door window.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul? Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's my Angel tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blow me. Dinner's almost ready. You feel like some wine? I feel like some wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Paul walks to the oven, opens the door and pats the chicken. Stone cold.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetie, here's a crazy thought... I don't feel like chicken tonight, why don't we order in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's actually something we need to talk about. It's about Raymond. He's back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door. Behind the chicken, Margaret doesn't look happy as Paul starts to explain. She rushes from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON: TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Home video of RAYMOND (then early 30s), fat, physically imposing and the only person not in festive tropical gear, standing in a VFW hall decorated in a Caribbean theme. (He is definitely not the same person Paul has cooling in the fridge.) A large banner behind him proclaims "HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY - BON VOYAGE."
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(a little drunk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I never thought it would last this long, but seeing as how it has... There ya go. Let me just say that my brother, old "Puddles McBarnesy" did better than he should have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
A younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his brother and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'cha saying there Raymond? Wha'cha saying 'bout me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough, OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(sing-songy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray's a little jeallllllllous. This is the one that got away, right Ray?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd LAUGHS as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair. Raymond, furious, grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to the floor. The laughter stops.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him alone, ball licker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And shut that thing --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
The screen turns to snow. We are...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul at his desk, watching the video on a small TV in the wall unit. He turns his attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents, souvenirs, old report cards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the TV playing behind him (the second part of the tape), Margaret is pictured on a cruise ship, sunning herself. Paul, obviously behind the camera, watches as Margaret takes a tropical drink from a WAITER'S tray, who promptly dumps it all over her. But instead of the expected burst of profanity, Margaret just LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay, don't worry about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as the waiter walks off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like the next one in a cup, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from Hawaii and digs out an insurance policy out of the box. On the last page is a list of the payouts. Loss of a limb: $100,000. Loss of thumb: $5,000. Accidental death: $1,000,000.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, as an extra bonus, Raymond's birth certificate. Perfect. Paul takes out the credit card application from work, and starts to write...
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond... Barnell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOBOGGANING HILL - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAUGHING children on toboggans, inner tubes and discarded cardboard boxes slide down a snow covered hill against a slate gray sky. It's an isolated area on the outskirts of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARY AND JIMBO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary and Jimbo sit in their car in the parking area.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one's your sister's kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the one on the little bike-thing? Him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You been alright with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing with the guy? Ya know, I thought it might kinda mess me up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First time for both of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but I've been sleeping really well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. 'Course, you didn't actually...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
Jimbo mimics snapping someone's neck. It's clearly not a gesture he enjoys. As Gary looks at him, a Cadillac pulls up beside them. Behind the wheel is DAVE (50s) well dressed, in a thuggish kinda way. Jimbo and Gary share a nervous look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About 50 yards away from the two cars, Gary's NEPHEW is having his Snowrider (a tricycle with skis instead of wheels) hijacked by a playground BULLY in a red parka. A tug o' war for the toy ensues as Gary and Jimbo get out of their car.
</DIRECTION>
<NEPHEW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leggo... it's mine. Uncle Gary!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEPHEW>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary and Jimbo are leaning close to the Cadillac's open window. Dave does not look happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jimbo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. He's disappeared?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Gary waves to his nephew.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just... hang in there, Billy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But he's dead. I mean, that part, no question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Take off your coat. And your shirt, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimbo knows better than to argue. He strips down, exposing his corpulent middle-aged belly to the chilly winter winds.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not wearing a wire, Dave, if that's what this is about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was our first time. No one gets it perfect their first time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, Sweetie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Gary is about to comply when the sound of a FIGHT on the tobogganing hill causes them all to look over, just in time to see GARY'S NEPHEW shoved to ground. The Bully LAUGHS as he slides away.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me for a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gary trots toward the hill. Jimbo can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary! We're in the middle of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(calling back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm supposed to be looking after him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimbo turns back to Dave, shrugging sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's fine. Look, we can take you there right now. We'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the Bully. He is failing.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me what? An empty trash dumpster? It was supposed to look like an accident. I was hoping to see it in the paper. So help me, if this guy pops up somewhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
While Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only watch as the Bully slides away.
</DIRECTION>
<BULLY>
<DIRECTION>
(echoing in the cold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fag! Big homo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BULLY>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't. He can't. He's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Proof, Jimbo. I like to know my money's well spent. You got a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Dave drives off as Gary walks over with his SNIFFLING nephew.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slippery little sucker. You mind if we stop at a toy store on the way back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARNELL HOME / BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE ON: Paul and Margaret in bed. Margaret takes up more than her share of the bed, her arm tossed over her husband. Paul, on his third of the bed, looks as if he's lying in state. But Paul's not sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARNELL HOME - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A newspaper clears the "For Sale - price reduced!" sign on the front lawn and lands with a THUD on the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul has the "Morning News" on the hood of his car. He looks over at the fridge, still padlocked.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see if anyone's missing you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He flips through each section. There's nothing. Paul walks to the fridge.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to the corpse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what kind of man let's himself just freeze to death in the trash, but I was never one to preach. Way I see it, you've probably got family somewhere and they'd probably appreciate seeing you get a decent funeral, even if it's not really... yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, somewhat befuddled, gently pats the fridge door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret pushes the vacuum across the floor, humming to herself. Paul walks by slipping into his coat. He notices that the vacuum isn't plugged in. Without missing a beat, he walks over and plugs it into the outlet. The VACUUM ROARS TO LIFE. Margaret doesn't flinch. Paul heads out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODED AREA - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ways out in the forest. Only two houses on this turn-out; a cozy looking lived in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home. A car pulls up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul adjusts a pillow he has taped to his stomach, then pulls on a blue ski mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk. He fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. WHERRY (80s), in her bathrobe, looks out the window of the cozy cabin. A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka. The blue parka waves back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul walks in from the garage, pulling off his blue parka. Margaret enters from the living room. (Paul still has the pillow taped to his front, which Margaret happily pokes with a finger but never mentions.)
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret smiles, relieved. The phone RINGS. Paul picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MRS. WHERRY'S HOME - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Wherry talks on the phone in her kitchen. The head of a large antelope is mounted on the wall behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_WHERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul? Thank you so much for clearing the drive way. That was most considerate.

EXT. WILDERNESS ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A "Moose Xing" sign is briefly illuminated by Paul's car's headlights as it heads up a snow packed mountain road. The distant lights of the city are swallowed by the thick forests of fir trees that line the road.
</DIRECTION>

Paul, nervous, sings along to "Escape" on the radio.

EXT. FOREST - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corpse, now in Raymond's clothing and the blue parka, lies face up on the Aloha Airlines promotional surfboard being lurched forward by Paul, who wears a pair of snowshoes. On the body's chest lies a second pair of snowshoes. Somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP/BOTTOM OF A RIDGE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul at the top of a 25 foot drop. He rolls the corpse, now wearing the other set of snowshoes, over the side. It BOUNCES down, landing in the snow with a soft WHUMPH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAUL'S HOME / KITCHEN - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul sits in a seeming stupor at the kitchen table. A DING from the microwave snaps him out of his catatonic state. He walks to the appliance, takes out his now re-heated coffee, checks his watch and heads out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF THE RIDGE / FOREST - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, wearing snowshoes and carrying the surfboard, peeks over the edge.

INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy, jumping up and down at the feet of Paul who stands over a SIZZLING frying pan full of bacon. He checks the bacon's consistency with a fork. Still pretty raw. He takes the bacon and lays it on a plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler. Paul carefully takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap. He holds it up. The bacon hangs down like fringe.

Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face toward the corpse.

THE BACON HAT -- as Paul pulls it snug on the corpse's head. He pulls the bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpse's parka. Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other hanging from a pocket. He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about this part.

Paul pats the body on the shoulder, then looks up at the ridge and the long journey ahead.

A WOLF appears in the moonlight. Followed by another, and another. They approach the corpse...

EXT. HIGHWAY TURNOUT / CLEARING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snowmobiles SCREAM to the site as people tramp through the thick snow, covering all of Paul's hard work. An ambulance and State Conservation vehicles pack the area where Paul first pulled off. Yellow police tape is strung between fir trees marking a path toward the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOTTOM OF RIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corpse is covered with a tarp. The area is littered with blood, animal tracks and bits of blue parka. POLICE OFFICERS and tough looking LOCAL SNOWMOBILERS mill about the corpse, taking turns lifting the tarp that covers the body. A few yards away, DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s) talks to a seemingly distraught Paul.
</DIRECTION>

	Mr. Barnell, I should warn you, an animal attack isn't pretty. There's not much left.

	Well, they've been asking me to talk some more about Raymond. I thought now might be an appropriate time.

</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you'll just happen to mention your heartless insurance company that hasn't paid off your policy yet.

	I had to borrow money for the casket, Mr. Ted.

</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are breaking my heart.

He pulls out some shots of his brother. They whip around in the wind and blowing snow.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, we could walk over there together. You could tell them how deeply moved you were by this tragedy and how... the check is on its way?

</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Ted thinks, grudgingly impressed with Paul's ploy.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill. Ted watches him go, is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes. Looking down he sees a photo of Raymond Barnell, on the beach in swim trunks. Must have fallen. Ted pockets it and moves on.

Margaret washes down some pills with her morning coffee as she looks at a fawn in the backyard, nibbling on a bush.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey little, Bambi. Where's your Mommy? Gettin' it from some ten point buck. Yes she is. Yes she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>

Just then, a THUMPING sound from the garage causes the fawn to bolt. Margaret turns, suspicious. She picks up the portable phone as she moves toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary sticks his head inside the now unchained fridge, grabs a can of soda from the door rack and closes the door. A moment later, he reopens the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, hanging off the frosty inside, is a chunk of the dead man's hair and scalp. Gary pulls it off, not sure what it means, but sure it means something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unseen behind him, Margaret steps into the garage. She quickly assesses the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from our fucking appliances.

<DIRECTION>
Gary spins, shocked to see Margaret.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, just calm down.

Margaret, eyes wide with fear, unleashes a hailstorm of soda cans, knickknacks, gardening implements and anything else she can lay her hands on.

	Hey! Would you... Lady... I have a--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to close in on her, but the torrent of stuff (a rake, a Whipper-Snipper, an old pair of skates...) keeps him pinned down. Finally, he manages to grab his gun from his pocket. But even as he raises it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Bissel Handvac catches him flush in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sud of a bit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He drops to his knees, grabbing his nose, which is now gushing blood. Margaret reaches for her portable phone and starts punching numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are in so much trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Gary stands, pissed off, gun aimed at Margaret's head.

<GARY>

Cam shrugs-- "sure." Ted hands him his clipboard and walks out, the door closes behind him with a loud BANG.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both ends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>

Gary and Jimbo have no idea how to react. Margaret senses their discomfort, starts to relax.

	Where would we stash her? Your place?

</JIMBO>
<GARY>

	See, it's just a bad idea.

INT. MOBILE HOME - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a KNOCK on the door. Paul heads to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	State Police. Is there a Mr. Barnell here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(as he unlocks it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, is there something wrong--
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
As he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open. The force of the blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head. RAYMOND BARNELL (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws him through the serving kitchen serving hatch. Raymond leans through the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
He walks around, takes a copy of "USA Today" and throws it at Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond? Is that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Page 16, Paul. That's why I love "USA Today", news from every fuckin' state. Don't you want to read it? I was eaten by wild fuckin' animals. But ya know, despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond right on his heels.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond, let me tell you what happened here. We all thought you were...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead? Yeah, I got that impression.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you had dropped off the face of the earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you just decide to make it permanent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But there were no records of you anywhere. I checked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs. Paul doubles over, gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using your actual ID can be a hinderance. But despite the reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on. Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was pretty pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging him to stop. Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a sitting position.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot. He woulda told 'em it's not me. Unless...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Paul can only sit there and WHEEZE. Raymond sits beside him on the floor, pulls out a cigarette and lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is it? Frame job, lawsuit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life insurance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figured. So where's my money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your money?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're still... investigating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(with a shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost worth coming back for. What's the split? I get half?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(not quite trusting him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(changing the subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look good. Lost some weight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gave up carbs. So what are you doing out here? She not go along with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Margaret?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How she hold up, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's fine. Actually, we're not doing so good right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any kids?

<DIRECTION>
(off his look)

Gary and Margaret sit in silence, Gary taking Margaret's pulse. Jimbo walks in, grocery bag in hand.

Gary jumps up and storms into the bathroom just off the kitchen.

<MARGARET>

	He's a little over tired.

</MARGARET>
<JIMBO>

EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / DRIVEWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, looking like a man who recently took a beating, shovels the light snow cover that blankets the drive. He looks as Ted's car pulls up. As Ted walks toward him...
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Watters. You said on the phone something about a resolution in our claim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Barnell. Why are you staying out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Paul thinks about this for a long time. Then, finally...
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife and I, we're having some problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of understandable I guess. Seeing as how you killed that man and dumped his body out in the woods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean Raymond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not Raymond. Definitely not Raymond. I thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure I appreciate your tone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My tone, Mr. Barnell? You are going to jail. I will personally see to that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really think you should go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a liar and thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night, so if you wouldn't mind just leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow. Ted, rolling his eyes, reaches down to help him up.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing the bruises)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. How'd you get all cut up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<MRS_WHERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's say you just move away from him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_WHERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a compound bow aimed at his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_WHERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right there, Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_WHERRY>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry. Just go back inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<MRS_WHERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can drop him if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_WHERRY>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Watters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you'd better go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off. Paul brushes the snow from his jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the wound).
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_WHERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_WHERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips. An idea slowly takes hold.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Raymond pours whiskey into a 7-11 specialty cup as Paul pulls off his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He give you the check?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He thinks I... It'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'll pay him a little visit. See if we can speed up the process.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to... I figured out a way to take care of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I was watching from the window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, agitated, pulls the blinds shut.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do that, Raymond. If someone sees you...

</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond walks over to Paul. Paul tenses, expecting to be hit. Raymond moves right by to refill his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After we get her back from these guys who grabbed her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth shut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crazy people talk a lot. And I think if you tell your therapist something, they can use it in court.

</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not... she doesn't have a therapist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>

(taking a slug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, might wanna think about it.

</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie. Fraud. Consorting with felons. Got to "cowboy up."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cowboy up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get tough, ya suck-hole. I'm just saying sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions. Cull the heard, so to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here. Don't be such a fuckin' stick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond, an enigma, looks at Paul, then grins -- just kidding. Paul relaxes. Raymond tenses -- not really. Paul's not sure how to read his brother as they shoot looks at one another -- sibling rivalry ad absurdum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY SKYLINE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky moves from dark grey to light grey, then stops. A thermometer outside on an office tower shows a brisk minus 20. Workers bundle themselves against the cold, hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted walks in, throwing his coat over the wall of his cubicle and is about to sit down when he notices Paul in his boss' office. Ted moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(MUFFLED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't called the police yet, but I'll tell you it was certainly tempting.

Ted opens the door to his boss' office. Paul doesn't notice.

Branch, obviously worried, stands.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watters. Glad you're... Mr. Barnell was just telling me about the... meeting you two had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I caught that, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BRANCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see... well, Mr. Barnell has some... concerns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
Paul turns to look at Ted. He has a large band-aid on his forehead, scratches and bruises on his face. It takes a second for the dime to drop.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think I did this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Paul gets up and moves to the other side of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on. I never laid a hand on him.

</BRANCH>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now just hang on here. Let me show you something...

Ted digs into his briefcase. He takes out a video tape, the police file on Raymond and the photo of Raymond Paul dropped in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul and Branch listen intently as Ted paces, the TV/VCR plays shots of the dead body in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? Where's the birthmark? Your brother's police report listed it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from the report)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...large purple birthmark, upper left thigh..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning into the screen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't see it. Not on this body. You can see it in the picture. See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted points to the photo; Raymond, in the summer, wearing shorts with a blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what, Mr. Barnell? Did it just disappear? Did it just... get better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted grins. His moment. Finally. Seconds feel like minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It... did get better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it now. Well how in the world did that happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond was always... bothered by it. When he came back from... Florida, he'd had it fixed. Laser surgery... like removing a tattoo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks at Branch. It's an excuse Ted hadn't thought of before.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did not.

</TED>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You taped my brother's body, in the morgue?

Paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this? You stole pictures of my family? And taped his naked body? What kind of sick company are you running here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh for... he's lying. It's obvious he...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
<DIRECTION>

	This is crazy. All we have to do is dig up the body... check the leg for scars...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dental records!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Paul goes white. He hadn't thought about this.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That will be just about enough of that. Mr. Barnell, I'm sorry it's all come to this. We'll have a check brought over to you tomorrow morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANCH>
<DIRECTION>
Paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out. After a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, with all due respect, he's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<BRANCH>

	Jesus, we're lucky he's not suing. Now tomorrow, you deliver the check to Mr. Barnell with a complete apology.

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, I understand how this looks --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

Paul puts a hand to his chest. Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts to RETCH. Tears well up in his eyes. After a few moments, the storm passes. Still on his knees, the person on the line comes back.

Ted walks to his car. As he opens the door -- WHAM! A fist to his face drops Ted. Raymond in a ski mask, picks him up, opens the car door and lays Ted's head on the door jamb.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of this. You get me?

	So let's just settle this right now, OK? We want what's coming to us.

	Avis. There haven't been any people in here for months. No one comes in here, unless they're looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish, neither of which we carry. So you can call me pretty much anything you want and it won't impress the customers at all because we don't have any.

<ARNITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good point Bill. Bill knows exhumation policy. You can look it up but I'm betting he's right. You come back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this.

Paul thinks for a moment, digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp, new hundred dollar bills and SLAMS them on the table.

Raymond is passed out on the sofa. Paul sits, gun in hand, the barrel pointed at Raymond's forehead. His finger grazes the trigger... but it's suddenly all too real. Paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again. Not wanting to be sprayed by Raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head... Another idea comes to him. Paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the blow back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at Raymond. Maybe it's the light... maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he looks almost angelic. Paul stares at his brother.

In the kitchen, Paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into The cup and hides it on the top shelf.

<RAYMOND>

Raymond walks on. Ted, realizing he has no choice, runs and jumps in front of Raymond, blocking his way.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I don't know exactly what's going on here, but if you would come with me to my office, just for a few minutes, it would really help me out with my boss.

EXT. PARKING AREA / BY PAUL'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At Jimbo's car, Gary is folding the corpse into the trunk as Jimbo pulls Margaret upright from the backseat and tugs down her gag. She smiles at him as, with great care, he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband.

That's when Paul sees what Jimbo and Gary are watching.
</DIRECTION>

Raymond kicks Ted in the head, turns, spots Paul and breaks into a run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul seems frozen, but just for a moment.
</DIRECTION>

Paul discretely takes off his red parka and drapes it over Margaret's shoulders.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret nods, kisses her husband quickly on the cheek, then starts to walk off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, Gary and Jimbo watch, transfixed at the down-parka'd shit-storm that is headed their way.

</RAYMOND>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What million dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMBO>
<DIRECTION>
Gary and Jimbo look over at Paul, somewhat confused. Raymond's ten yards out, and they can now see he's taken out his gun. He's aiming it at Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks over his shoulder at Margaret, who's having some trouble making it up a snow covered hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary's hand slips into his pocket, grabbing hold of his gun. Raymond, oblivious, moves right past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TED'S CAR

Tiffany finally looks over at Ted, who's just getting to his feet. She bursts out of the car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA / BY PAUL'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond reaches Paul, takes the gun and points it at the top of his head. Paul's eyes shut tight, expecting the worst.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond... please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
But shooting your brother is tougher than it looks. Paul opens his eyes. Raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't. He moves the barrel six inches to the right and shoots Margaret in the back. She drops face first into the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's world ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ears RINGING, he rushes toward his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimbo can't believe it as Gary holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! What the fuck!!

Raymond, a look of relief on his face, turns to Jimbo.

But even before Raymond can raise his weapon, Gary pulls his gun and gets it pointed (shakily) at Raymond.

Raymond drops his gun to his side. Gary smiles, too happy he won the face off.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You win, tough guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand. As he does-- BANG! The bullet rips into the snow about six feet from Raymond's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond glares at Gary. So does Jimbo.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(meek, apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimbo lunges for cover as Raymond FIRES back. Gary, truly terrified, closes his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run -- BANGBANGBANGBANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One bullet bounces off Paul's car. One hits Raymond. With a quizzical look on his face, he drops to his knees. A large crimson stain forms on his jacket. Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body.

Paul gently turns her over. Margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul... Someone kicked me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now embedded with the slug from the Raymond's gun. He starts to weep tears of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you stand.

Jimbo gently takes Gary's gun.

<JIMBO>

As Jimbo puts an arm around Gary and helps him to the car, he sees Paul, arm around Margaret, coming their way. Everyone stops. A look passes, then both couples move off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jimbo and Gary drive away, Paul brings Margaret to his vehicle. Spotting Raymond, he walks over, kicks the gun away, then leans down. Raymond's not dead, but he's close.

Paul has to turn away.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me, you little...

Paul turns back, not angry, not frightened, just a little sad. Raymond, taken aback for a moment, tries for one last verbal shot, but all he can manage is...
</DIRECTION>

Paul turns back to his car when he spots a delirious, damaged Ted stumbling toward him with Tiffany desperate to drag him the other way.

Ted, barely able to stay on his feet (concussion) gets in front of Paul, and just stands there and waits. Paul can't help but feel bad for the guy.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well go ahead.

(a long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love my wife, Mr. Watters. And when you love someone, I mean, really love someone...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The punch hits Paul on the top of his head. He stumbles back, but Ted is on him before he can move out of range. It's a strange looking fight between the younger (physically spent) and older (emotionally drained).
</DIRECTION>

The car is still in the parking area. Paul and a bloody, beaten Ted sit up front with Margaret and Tiffany in the back. No one speaks, until...

	<DIALOGUE>
	They call this the listening game. Mr. Barnell, you get to go first.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ted glares at Tiffany, but her look instantly softens him. Ted looks at Margaret, who looks expectantly at Paul. Ted shrugs.

Paul starts to talk, and Ted starts to listen...

Paul looks up to see Margaret. Dressed in a coat, she is standing in the middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor lamp.

Paul flips Margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded Hawaiian Hilton postcard from the box in his den.

Paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his arm. Margaret picks up Jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over.
