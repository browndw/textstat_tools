ESTABLISHING SHOT - EXTREME CLOSE - UP - COBBLESTONES - PARIS - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We OPEN with the screen filled with a dark gray, cut down the middle by a black crevice. We should be unsure of what we are looking at. Is it the surface of the moon or some primeval canyon covered in volcanic ash? Just then a liquid with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the crevice and further divides the screen in two, like a river border dividing East from West perhaps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal that the dark gray gulch filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a Parisian street and the yellowish river that ran down the middle of the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two little boys, who are peeing on the pavement, laughing at their mischief. The boys are twins. They wear backpacks and are set to go off to school. Just then we HEAR the voice of a WOMAN shouting in French (with English subtitles).
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH_WOMAN>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think you're going?! You ought to be ashamed behaving like that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRENCH_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal ever more scenes of life on this particular street. The woman shouts at the children from her window and the children run off. At the corner, fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe, as chairs are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are preparing for their morning clientele.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal a taxi driver arguing with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and set off for work as we continue pulling back and across the city over Montmartre, picking up an argument between two drivers here, fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over there. Chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the city awakens and we float across Montmartre into a small residential quarter. Husbands kiss wives who send school children on their way as TITLES CONTINUE and the city comes more and more to life and we hover across a small square just up from the Place de la Opera, not far from the Boulevard Saint Germain-des-Pres, with Montmartre in the b.g. The square has a sidewalk cafe with tables extending out onto a peninsula of pavement that stretches to the foot of a small hotel, whose shuttered windows overlook the square. As we pull back and back over the small square, we literally...

SFX SHOT

...Pull backwards through the slats of the shutter, going from an aerial shot, being sucked in through the semi-closed shutters into a hotel room where we continue ever so slowly, pulling back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - PARIS - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first thing we SEE in this shot which should appear seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the preceding scene, is a spider-web. We are TIGHT on the web in which a still-living insect struggles against his silky bonds. The web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops, spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim, soon to be lunch. As the spider makes this journey we become aware in the b.g. of the panting sounds of lovemaking. It is a woman's breathless sighs and gasps we hear, but under that, perhaps a man's voice, perhaps not. The sounds build to a climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers the glistening body of a beautiful young Parisian woman in post-coital dewy Nirvana. Then, the figure of a nude man in silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered window. His face and body are half-lit by the slats of light that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room. He lights a cigarette.

whom we will come to know as CARLOS. He lights the cigarette and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his lungs, glancing out at the street and alternately at the spider who tiptoes down to her prey. He watches the spider envelop the still-living victim with her spindly legs. Then he takes another drag on the cigarette and the ash glows bright, a burning ember which he touches ever so slowly to the spider's body. It sizzles.

INT. BATHROOM - HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos stands in front of the mirror. The mirror is cracked and in it we see the fractured face of Carlos staring back at us from opposite sides of the cracked glass. He wears surgical gloves. From a make up kit by the side of the sink he removes a piece of false hair and spirit gum as TITLES CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A. Carlos affixes a John Lennon mustache.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B. Carlos puts on a brown wig of moderately longish hair such as one might have seen on a student in Paris in the early seventies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C. Carlos puts on a pair of John Lennon granny glasses and the student look is complete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D. Carlos stands in front of a full length mirror in jeans and a blue work shirt over which he puts a worn grey jacket. He now looks every inch the young French student dressing down to look like one of the proletariat.
</DIRECTION>

END OF TITLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E. Carlos takes an M26 hand grenade and puts it into an inside pocket of his coat. He puts a machine pistol and snaps its ammo clip into it and puts it in his student's shoulder bag and then takes a Walther PPK and places it in his jeans at the small of his back. All the while that he is doing these things he sings: "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE."

EXT. / INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a hot Sunday afternoon and the complex of shops and a cafe in St. Germain-des-Pres is bustling with young clientele. Inside the cafe, there is a second floor with a balustrade overlooking the tables inside. Outside, there are tables set up on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK SHAW, a tall, husky American in his late thirties, sits at one of the front tables outside. He reads the International Herald Tribune. The headline is, "Terrorists Seize Embassy, Issue Demands And Threaten Attacks." Jack sips his espresso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CARLOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dressed as in preceding scene. He enters. Just then Jack looks up and sees him. For an instant, Carlos looks at Jack, tenses just slightly. Jack looks back at his paper paying no attention. Carlos pulls out a cigarette, pats his pockets for a light. Then he crosses to Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon monsieur...

He mimes flicking a match and Jack looks for a match. He's out. He offers the lit end of his cigarette. Carlos cups Jack's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merci.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses away from Jack, smiling and goes inside the cafe. Jack follows him absentmindedly, tracking his progress through the windows, though his view is obscured somewhat by reflections of the street. Carlos steps casually to the railing overlooking the tables inside as Jack sees the double image of Carlos and the reflected street scene. Carlos leans over, pulls the pin from an M26 grenade, and lets the "spoon" come off in his hand. We HEAR the timing fuse hiss as Carlos nonchalantly counts to himself.

ANGLE ON JACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
disheveled, covered with the shattered glass of the window, but not but not seriously hurt, he struggles to his feet. He looks around for Carlos who has vanished, now realizing who he was. As he looks around, he sees a SMALL BOY staring at his left arm with heart-rending disbelief.

There are throngs of ambulances, police and military personnel, wounded survivors are being tended to. All is confusion and off in a corner we SEE Jack, standing with a man in a suit. The man's name is DU FOLTIERE. He shows Jack an I.D.

It's a cold Sunday morning with a light snow just beginning to fall when SIX YOUNG MEN and ONE WOMAN enter the headquarters of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- a modern, seven-story block of concrete and glass. They all carry Adidas sport bags over their shoulders. Their leader, Carlos, with dark beret and sunglasses, sports a long white raincoat -- the kind that was very much in fashion that winter. Next to him is KOJ, a Japanese terrorist and his most trusted Lieutenant.

The group with the Adidas sport bags approaches the reception desk. Carlos -- moustache, sideburns, and wispy beard in reddish brown -- smiles politely at the female RECEPTIONIST. Behind the reception desk are two circular staircases which wind their way up to an elevator that is visible behind the railing at the top of the landing. There is what appears to be a security man standing at that elevator with an earpiece and tell-tale bulge under his jacket.

by the elevator at the top of the stairs. Carlos bounds up the stairs and pushes the elevator button. The Security Man near the elevator listens intently to what is being said in his earpiece and he steps forward to challenge Carlos. Carlos smiles at him and whips out a 9mm. silenced Beretta and fires two shots right between the Security Man's eyes. He falls over the railing and lands face up on the console in front of the terrified receptionist. Carlos leans over the rail in one move and fires two shots into the upturned face of the Security Man who stands next to the shocked receptionist. The receptionist screams.

Everyone frantically hits the floor. That is, with the exception of TWO BODYGUARDS. They try for their weapons. A short burst from Carlos' Beretta machine pistol which is pulled from the inside of his trenchcoat brings them to the floor. This weapon is not silenced, but deafening. Just then Koj enters the room from the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<KOJ>

Suddenly, there's the sound of INTENSE GUNFIRE coming from the corridor.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON - CARLOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a pocket-sized Chinese RGD5 grenade. He yanks the pin, lets the spoon fly, listens to the fuse hiss, counts quite calmly and then tosses the live grenade to Koj who catches it and in one movement tosses it out the door. A loud sound of GRENADE EXPLOSION, and plaster powders those glued to the floor. GASPS OF TERROR. But the gunfire outside ceases.

Jack stands inside of a stall in the men's room. He has just crossed a certain frontier in his mind and stepped in to the area known as no man's land. He quickly takes off his overcoat and jacket and we SEE attached to his arm a harness made up of straps and springs. He opens his briefcase and attaches to the harness a .32 caliber Beretta. He fumbles with the adjustments, racing against time. Finally, he seems to have adjusted everything just so. Then he lowers his arm to his side. Then he raises the right arm as if shaking hands and the harness slams the .32 caliber Beretta from his forearm straight into his palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He resets the gun back into the forearm position. He has a look of grim determination on his face. The only question is, is it the look of someone who is crazy enough to do what he is contemplating.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. VIENNA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - BLIZZARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the tarmac, an Austrian Airways DC9. TV cameras, lights, generators are set up in front of the plane, sending beams and pools of yellow light into the darkness and the snow which swirls all around as a pool of REPORTERS stands ready to record whatever is about to go down. Among a small group of OFFICIALS is Jack Shaw. Everyone's eyes are on an approaching yellow curtained bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it gets closer, we can detect through its windshield a white raincoat and a black beret. Carlos is standing by the driver with a machine-pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other.

<DIRECTION>
His eyes strain to get a better look at the terrorist, his arm down at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the bus parks by the DC 9, Carlos jumps out and waves to the media. Not the customary V-sign, but the wave of a celebrity... The hostages then, under their captors' guns, file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane. A line of exhausted, bleary-eyed middle-aged men in expensive suits and in need of a shave. Carlos however, is as fresh, alert and energetic as the morning of the attack. And he's definitely savoring the moment.

ON CARLOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone on board, he too climbs the mobile steps and disappears into the plane. Suddenly, he reemerges and comes down to where the officials and Jack stand. As Jack watches him intently, he faces the MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. In the window of the plane we SEE Koj holding a grenade to the pilot's head.

</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Minister of the Interior, I presume...?

The distinguished-looking man, who looks a bit like Kurt Waldheim, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry this had to happen in Austria. We have no quarrel with your government.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
His eye catching Jack, he stops in mid-sentence. A devilish smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him. He pulls a cigarette out and crosses right over to Jack, up close and as they say, very personal. The snowflakes whirl surrealistically around them as the two stand face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon monsieur...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
He mimes flicking a match. He takes off his glasses and looks at Jack and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were never really properly introduced Mister Shaw. My name is Carlos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
With a cunning, mocking smile he extends his hand out to shake Jack's. Jack stares at him, ever so slowly beginning to raise his hand. With that move he knows the gun will come slapping into his palm and he will be able to take Carlos out no matter what the cost.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat shit and die slow.
	</DIALOGUE>

His hand starts rising. In another second the gun will spring into it. Just then we hear:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKENA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns to look at Mickens. Mickens indicates the photographers.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want your picture taken shaking his hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKENA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is momentarily confused. He has turned to Mickens thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now the moment for the shot has passed. He turns back to Carlos who shrugs and steps over to the Austrian minister so that the Minister now is between Jack and Carlos and the shot is lost.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
(to the minister)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I was saying, I'm sorry about the loss of life. And thank you for your cooperation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLOS>
<DIRECTION>
Once again he sticks out his hand. Only this time, as the cameras roll, Austria's Minister of the Interior shakes the hand of the archterrorist in what will go down in history as the "handshake of shame."

CAMERA then pans and tilts down and we are above the Western Wall looking down on the bobbing black hats of Hassidic Jews, the knitted skullcaps of more modern Orthodox, here and there the olive shirt of Army uniform with M16 or Galil assault rifle that sways in prayer as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROSS DISSOLVE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the Jerusalem stone paving stones that make up the square in front of the wall as we glide across the intersecting lines of paving stones set one next to the other until a glowing cigarette comes into view and then a foot which crushes it out. There should be something in this sequence that is reminiscent of our opening, a foreboding that just as the cracks in the Parisian paving stones led us to Carlos once before, perhaps these new stones will lead us once again to some act of terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to reveal a man standing in silhouette, the man who has just crushed out the cigarette. We cannot see his face because he has a camera to his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - POV THROUGH THE CAMERA LENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the lens of the camera just established we SEE an old Rabbi praying at the wall. CLICK! The shutter captures the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in silhouette now lowers the camera and we SEE that he is CARLOS! There is no mistake even though the nose, perhaps is a little different and this time he is clean- shaven, it is still Carlos the Jackals. He smiles slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Busy photographing it, Carlos doesn't seem to notice the TWO ARABS who watch him surreptitiously. He walks in front of soldiers who laugh and look at us POV Carlos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos reaches into his pocket. Is he perhaps going for a grenade to toss at these soldiers? We build tension as he pulls out instead, another roll of film and with great determination, we have the CLICK of the door of the camera to enhance our music beat as tension builds. Surely it can't be long till Carlos does something awful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos walks towards the Suq, working his way through the crown from the Damascus gate as we reveal more soldiers in the foreground, surveilling the area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the POV of the two Arabs following him, we SEE Carlos lost, or pretending to be, as he ambles along through the Suq, past all sorts of vendors hawking their wares. Heads of fish are cut off with the swift slash of a knife in one stall, freshly skinned lambs hang by their feet in another. Carlos, still looking lost, approaches a street vendor hawking rosary beads. We SEE them talk but cannot hear their dialogue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of children play an impromptu game of soccer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - SAME SCENE - POV CARLOS THROUGH CAMERA LENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch these innocent children playing. If this was a gun sight they'd be dead. CLICK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Carlos who has taken the picture. His smile at the sight of the children is no longer a subtle one. There is some secret enjoyment here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's then, that he notices the Two Arabs tailing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON - CARLOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now what happens can be interpreted in one of two ways. Carlos takes a turn down an alleyway that has at first a shop or two, and then is nothing but deserted and foreboding alley. He is either trying to shake the two Arabs or he has just entered every tourist's nightmare: a deserted alley in a foreign country with two bad guys. He quickens his pace. The Arabs do too. Carlos now knows they're after him and he takes off running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY - CHASE SEQUENCE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So do the two Arabs. Only now there are THREE MORE ARABS coming after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tense, desperate CHASE in the Moslem Quarter's labyrinth of twisted alleys and narrow streets. When his Arab pursuers lose sight of him briefly, Carlos takes something out of his pocket, some sort of ID and throws it in an alleyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUQ - JERUSALEM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos races through the Suq, past a group of Arabs who begin heeding the call to prayer. They roll out prayer mats and begin acclaiming in Arabic that there is only one God and Mohammed is his prophet. Carlos grabs one of the canvas awnings that shade the alleyways and this cafe. He rips it off, trying to make an obstacle course between him and his pursuers. He overturns trays of olives, sacks of sunflower seeds, anything he can get his hands on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos runs headlong into a copper serving platter that is hanging on display. He is disoriented, terrified, and then seemingly from out of nowhere, he is tackled, grabbed by the Arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores. Carlos is overcome and brought down to the ground. One of the Arabs evidently has a deep dislike for Carlos and though Carlos is subdued, he kicks the shit out of him.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WINDOWLESS CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This room is your worst nightmare in the Middle East. It could be a cellar suite in Beirut, or an interrogation cell in Damascus. There is no way of knowing. It is simply an empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floor, to which Carlos is shackled. Battered and badly bruised, he's obviously in great pain. The room's metal door SCREECHES as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call AMOS enters. With him are two of the Arabs we've seen earlier. They're bareheaded now, without their kaffiyehs.

SCOTT III, a 50-year-old pin-striped suiter who appears to be amused. With him is Monroe, his Black deputy and Jack. In front of Jack, spread out on the desk is a file on Ramirez. We SEE it as Jack does. Notes on the interrogation, Polaroid photos of Ramirez in custory and the developed pictures from the roll of film which Ramirez was taking in Jerusalem. Jack listens to Scott and Monroe, but as he does he is taking in all the information in Ramirez's file, making no judgments, just taking in information.

In the hospital bed is a six-year-old swathed in bandages. The child is pitiful with IVs sticking in him and tubes running underneath the bandages, and a heart monitor beeping weakly above him. His parents sit next to his bed. The father wears the khaki uniform of a Naval Lieutenant.

The parents turn to them as they enter. The parents wear the look all parents wear in their children's hospital rooms at the signt of the doctor who may be able to save their child's life. A look of hope. A look of desperation.

	Here's the boy's chart, Doctor. As you can see, one kidney was destroyed by the shrapnel. There's a large perforation in the left lung, the spleen, the large intestine, the stomach lining were all torn. There are over a hundred individual shrapnel fragments. It was obviously designed by Carlos to maim, not to kill.

He hands him the photo album.

	These are pictures of just some of Carlos' victims. Most of them are children. We haven't had time to get that kid's picture in yet. Up until I heard about you, all we could do about Carlos was take pictures of his victims. I wasn't lying to those people. You are the only one who can do anything about Carlos. I'm not the bad guy, Annibal. Carlos is. I'm just trying to make you see the choices.

Ramirez is still too angry to speak.

INT. RAMIREZ HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

Ramirez sits at his desk looking at the presentation book Jack gave him. The study is a reflection of the man, Navy pennants, photos, ships in bottles, family photographs. He is very much at home in this sanctuary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT

Photos of victims. Bloodied children, women, men, each atrocity labeled with the place of the attack and number of dead and wounded.

Just then there is a knock at the door. Ramirez closes the book and covers it with a newspaper as his wife Maura enters wearing a very sexy teddy with a short robe over it, giving off the promise of a wonderful night of conjugal bliss.

EXT. AERIAL SHOT - MONTREAL, CANADA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Montreal is an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence. It is a city part way up a mountain, Mount Royale. We TRACK a car as it drives up out of the city, up the mountain to of all places, a cemetery which sits at the foot of a deserted prison that looms above it. The cemetery like the prison is deserted. There can be no more desolate place than a graveyard full of long-dead prisoners whose prison has long since been shut down.

EXT. CEMETERY TO ABANDONED PRISON - MONTREAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A camera mounted atop a light fixture pans with Jack's car all the way up to the prison entrance. Signs on the prison proclaim that it is closed and that trespassing is forbidden. As Jack pulls up at the prison, a plainclothed operative comes out and as Ramirez and Jack pull Ramirez's bag out of the car, the operative slips into the driver's side and whisks it away. The ground around the area is full of snow that has not been plowed so the look of desertion is complete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MONTREAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an observation tower in the middle of the room which has become home to the pigeons who now flap noisily out of it as Jack crosses with Ramirez. The place has the look of an impromptu military encampment in a bombed out wreck of a building. In the observation room are several nondescript types. Jack shows Ramirez in.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an ad hoc operation set up specifically for your mission. When that's over, not even a trace of it will remain. You don't need to know anyone's name. And from now on, your name is Miguel... Security.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks Ramirez down the corridor. They pass the Surveillance Room, the small cell with its satellite dish and single computer terminal and operator established earlier as Technician #1. From here, cables snake their way along everywhere. The place has the look of a mobile high-tech spy station that just happens to be set up in a former prison. Ramirez looks around. The idea of being in a prison is obviously uncomfortable for him.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just say everything has its purpose. And Miguel... no one is to know anything about you other than that you're our student. So don't call me sir, because it's like wearing a sign on your forehead that you're military. From here on out forget the Navy.

INT. COMMAND ROOM - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Ramirez walk along until they come to a site which could as easily be in a space station on the dark side of the moon. There in the middle of a huge room looms a plastic enshrouded satellite tracking system. The plastic hangs down from the roof encapsulating this area to protect all of the state of the art computer equipment from the dust. Inside this plastic shrouded space we SEE technicians at monitors which display every approach to the prison as well as monitors which display the surveillance images transmitted back via satellite.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our surveillance and satellite tracking center. Just as we are plotting to destroy Carlos, if he knew what we're trying to do, I assure you he'd try to find a way to kill us first.

INT. PLASTIC COVERED COMMAND CENTER - ABANDONED PRISON -DAY

Jack pushes through the plastic shroud into a command center- like room. He and Ramirez enter. This place is high-tech, computers and neon lighting.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlos has two main safe houses. One in Libya, one in East Germany. We have satellites that pass over each one three times a day. Unfortunately, the Russians know exactly when our satellites are in position so we have to assume that Carlos knows as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>

They cross over to the satellite tracking monitors which display both the Libyan and East German safe houses. Sitting in front of one of the monitors is Amos, typing controls into the satellite tracking system.

	There's one person I want you to meet, though I think the two of you have already been introduced.

	There are a lot of hard feelings. And I'm still gonna sue you when this is over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miguel, this is a combined Israeli- American operation. Amos here knows Carlos better than anyone in the free world. He was the one who took that picture of Carlos in Libya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you could get a picture of him why didn't you just kill him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAMIREZ>
<AMOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let all this equipment fool you. Carlos still has the home court advantage. He has the best protection in the world... three layers at least at all times. Next and maybe most important... Carlos himself. The French DST came to arrest him once. He was at his apartment, drunk, playing his guitar. He actually had them convinced it was all a mistake. Then he went into his bathroom, took a shave mind you so he would look his best for the interrogation and when he came out managed to shoot each of them through the forehead. Then he got the informer who had betrayed him, put him down on his knees and killed him... Think of it. He took a shave and didn't even nick himself once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMOS>
<DIRECTION>
Amos is quiet, lets that sink in.
</DIRECTION>
<AMOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally, there are political realities. Whoever hits Carlos has to realize that he'll unleash against himself a fanatical wave of terrorist activity in retribution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMOS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That by the way, is the last question you're going to ask. From now on you'll get information when and how we want you to get it. Not before. You don't ask questions, you just do what you're told.

	This is going to be unlike any learning experience you've ever had before. For one thing, we're going to push to all your limits. Fatigue, frustration and fear. We're going to make you more terrified than you've ever been in your life just to see how you handle the fear. Any other learning experience you get things ninety- nine point nine nine nine percent right you get an "A." Here if you get things ninety-nine point nine nine nine percent right... you get...

Jack walks right up to Ramirez and mimes a gun with his thumb and index finger and puts it right up to Ramirez's temple and goes...

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead! And I'll tell you the truth. I honestly in my heart of hearts don't care whether you live or die. Don't take that personal. I don't care whether I live or die. I do care about getting Carlos. That's all I care about.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what will get you killed. Carlos is always looking... always paying attention. Always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<AMOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Carlos is the master of the techniques of survival which we will teach you and because he is an efficient killer for whoever employs him, then for him there are simply no rules. Unlike you Miguel, you're a rule follower, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMOS>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<AMOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carlos is the opposite of that and that's what's so seductive, you know? He can kill whomever he chooses... ravish whoever he chooses... take whatever he chooses. Do... whatever he chooses. It is to be in many ways a superman, not bound by the mores or morals of humanity.

Ramirez is doing furious situps, hanging off the balcony of one of the tiers, with his feet linked under one of the bars so that as he does his sit-up it is over an abyss. Amos stands in front of Ramirez, puffing on a cigar as he speaks, so that Ramirez is gulping in breaths of cigar smoke as he exercises.

They walk into a scene that is completely surreal. Standing behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers.

Each man wears a white parka and white pants against the freezing cold. In the center of their impromptu circle stands Ramirez, also wearing white, but of much lighter material so that he shivers in the cold. All of them including Ramirez hold paint pellet guns. It is a cemetery full of living targets which can shoot back. Jack stands outside the circle.

Ramirez hesitates a moment, trying to remember where the tombstone with the name "Brisson" is. The trainer who stands behind the "Brisson" tombstone has no such hesitation.

In the middle of a huge room, a movie set has been erected. There are flats supported by sand bags which form the "set" of a kitchen. The set is perfect in every way but its position inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre, since no movie is being shot here and no audience will ever see these performances. Jack is there with Ramirez. He opens the refrigerator and Ramirez looks inside as Jack times him on his watch, then closes the refrigerator. Ramirez sneezes. He has caught a cold but must ignore it.

Ramirez and Jack walk together on the belvedere which is an observation area with a railing around it, overlooking the abandoned prison. In between the belvedere and the prison is a field which is almost completely barren except for one tree. It sits down below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, we SEE a snow mobile approach with its lights on. Just then, Jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter and slips it into the front pocket of Ramirez's jacket, turning it on as he does.

Jack quickly moves away from Ramirez. As Ramirez moves, he notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and continues to home in on him. And then there is a second snow mobile. And then a third, all of them coming straight for him. He starts to run. The snow mobiles turn and continue bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. We SEE the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, evidently homing in on his transmitter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a Beretta and sets it on the rail. We SEE on the snow mobiles, a lit- up remote device.

<JACK>

	If you shoot out the receivers, they'll stop. There are ten rounds in this clip. The first two are live, the next three dummy, then three live, two dummy.

Ramirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant and then goes running for the gun. He cannot make it to the gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. He is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. The snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through the rail, falling down to the field below. Ramirez is up and running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow mobile draws closer. Then he fires and hits a headlight, then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. That snow mobile stops in its tracks. The third now barrels down on Ramirez. He clicks off two dummy rounds and just before the snow mobile hits him, a shot rings out. The receiver shatters and we SEE Jack standing with the smoking gun with which he has just saved Ramirez's life.

Walk casually through the house so as not to make her suspicious of anything you do and find out if she's telling you the truth or not. If you pass this test your questions will be answered.

Ramirez walks casually through the living room with camera following. Amos and Jack walk behind him. Ramirez bends down to tie his shoe near the sofa. He crosses into the kitchen and camera follows. He opens the refrigerator and takes out a carton of milk. He takes a drink from the carton and dribbles some onto his shirt and onto the floor. He gets an "I'm such a slob" look on his face. Then he replaces the milk, crosses to the sink, takes the sponge off the sink and a paper towel. He mops up the spill with the sponge first and then with the paper towel, then tosses the paper towel into the trash. As he speaks, Ramirez himself will be amazed at how much he is able to deduce using the techniques he's been taught.

Probably from a couple of plates. There's a bit of water in the silverware tray. The milk is still fresh... not even a hint of being sour and the date on it is a week from today... means she just bought it yesterday or the day before.

There is a man in a business suit walking on the sidewalk in this picture. We CUT back and forth between Ramirez and then as Ramirez strains to look harder, unbelievingly, we PUSH IN tighter on the picture from his POV and to our amazement, the man in the picture looking back up at us is Ramirez! Then suddenly the man in the picture moves and his finger comes up to his lips and he looks at us and says, "SHHHHH." Just then, a street vendor in the same scene pulls out a gun and shoots Ramirez in the picture in the head. Ramirez falls and the picture goes back to a still shot of Ramirez lying face down in the black and white photo, oozing black blood onto the white sidewalk of beautiful downtown Tripoli.

Child Ramirez and his Mother walk down the corridor behind two Cuban prison guards. The cells are full of Cuban political prisoners. There are shouts and screams of agony from men being tortured somewhere far off. They reach Ramirez's father's cell. Child Ramirez reaches out for his father's hand. A guard pushes his hand away. RAMIREZ'S FATHER speaks in Spanish.

He walks in his black jeans and T-shirt. The cells are empty around him but up ahead he hears the sounds of someone making love. Well, not making love... fucking. He approaches the sounds and there in one cell is is wife Maura under Carlos, humping away at her. Carlos looks up at Ramirez.

The crow turns back into a dove and then suddenly the dove begins to choke, to vomit. It opens its beak and out of its mouth emerges the wet, slimy head of a full grown ravenous crow. It is coming straight out of the dove's mouth and straight at us, to devour us. We HEAR RAMIREZ SCREAM OVER THIS.

<JACK>

	No rules, Jack? Then you fucking deal with it.

</RAMIREZ>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez waits for Jack to say something... to protest... to say anything. Jack says nothing. Ramirez turns in a fury and starts walking away as the snowmobiles bear down from four different directions, coming straight towards Jack. Jack says absolutely nothing. Ramirez turns and sees Jack is making absolutely no attempt to toss the transmitter. Jack simply locks eyes with Ramirez. Jack is not going to budge. Ramirez turns his back and is about to continue walking away but the noise of the snowmobiles bearing on the unrelenting Jack grows louder. Ramirez can take it no more. He turns, pulls out the gun and must run right to where Jack is in order to get shots off at each snowmobile. He fires through the dummy rounds until he takes out all four snowmobiles, the last of which comes to rest only a few feet away from them both. Ramirez is exhausted. When Jack speaks it is quietly and with contempt.

	You know why you don't fuck around on your wife? Not because you don't want to. You're a man. You want to fuck everything. But you don't... because you're afraid it would cost you what... your wife, your family, your self respect maybe...

As we watch Ramirez listening to Jack, we can see him going over the edge.

<JACK>

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez walks straight over to Jack, pulls his hair back so that Jack is staring up at him and then he puts the barrel of his gun at Jack's temple. Ramirez is not bluffing now. He has gone completely into the dark side for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<RAMIREZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No rules, Jack? Okay... We're in a fucking foreign country on a secret mission... I can't be here, I'm on a submarine. The U.S. Navy's my alibi. What's the count on my ammunition, Jack? Is this one live or a dud?

Ramirez stays with the gun pointed at Jack. It is obvious he is in a killing mood, perfectly ready and willing to squeeze the trigger once again. Amos takes the gun from Ramirez, points it up and pulls the trigger... KABOOM!

EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first we should not realize we are near a building of any kind. We open on a WIDE ANGLE on the Dead Sea from a stunning POV. CRANE DOWN to reveal the silhouette of Ramirez smoking a cigarette. We now SEE that his nose is exactly that of Carlos. He has just a bit of dark circles left under his eyes, just enough to make him seem moody. He tosses the cigarette and turns to enter a room. Now we see that this is a deserted barracks pock-marked with artillery shells and machine gun bullet holes from past wars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONY - SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET

INT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
start TIGHT on a shot of an ashtray. It is overflowing with cigarettes. A woman's hand picks up the butt that is in the ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another cigarette off it. She is CARLA, mid-thirties, hard edged which mars the beauty she still has. She is intense, neurotic and bitter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Ramirez are alone in the living room. She sits in a corner. We become aware of the room. It is a study in contrasts. Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in ruined walls. And yet, the interior is somehow soft, sensuous, with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an altar. She pays no attention to Ramirez. She doesn't even acknowledge that he's entered the room. She is in a kind of reverie.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing about Carlos is... he doesn't lose himself with a woman... not with a lover... maybe with a whore I don't know... I wasn't his whore. Lovers are different to him... he might have a use for them... so he has to seduce them properly. He has to make sure they're so crazy about him they'll do anything for him.

	Shhh! You're not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARLA>
<DIRECTION>
She rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey she holds at her side. She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't bother to wipe it away. It is there next to tearstains on her cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who will get her in the mood for what she must do. She must get herself wet. She must get herself ready. She must recapture what it is to be seduced by Carlos. Her hand is her lover now.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't exist until I'm ready to let you exist, and then... you do exactly what I say.

She leans her head back and conjures Carlos up in her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<CARLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not pleasure for him... it's... it's... it's... this sick kind of conquest... you know this seduction... he's got to make you not just a lover but a disciple... a worshipper... He brainwashes you with his body... so... so... you'll do anything... you see because he's the perfect lover... he does it all to... not to please you... but to excite you... to... to make it dangerous for you and then, that's very sexy too, to a woman... that danger... like he could kill you in a second... but instead he makes you come... So he's almost killed you, you see? And you have this orgasm right then and it's like he's killed you and there isn't anything left of you and he makes you be born again the way he wants you to be. So there isn't a thought in your brain that he hasn't put there. Not a feeling in your body that he hasn't put there.

RAMIREZ'S POV

<DIRECTION>
The foreboding paranoia that everyone is staring at him. Soldiers, security men, airport employees, other passengers. They all seem to know his secret. They're all just waiting for the axe to fall. Ramirez heads over to the Customs booth. He turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich Arabic family. A young fat girl holding some toys grimaces at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family through the crowd. In the b.g. we notice a Mercedes waiting for them through the glass doors of the airport. Ramirez continues on his way towards the Customs booth. Behind a curtain, he sees a man being searched.

The bellboy enters with Ramirez, sets down his bags and then opens the shutters of the window. Ramirez tips him silently. Once the bellboy has left, Ramirez walks to the phone and checks it out. Then he crosses to the shutters. Perhaps he sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment across the street. He closes the shutters. Just then, there's a LOUD KNOCK on the door. He jumps and automatically goes for his gun. But he has no gun... and his heart begins to POUND again. The LOUD KNOCK repeats itself.

Ramirez carefully opens the door. In walks a young, rather innocent-looking WAITER with a jar of ice water. He wears a fez on his head. As he places it on a table, Ramirez eyes him with suspicion. Suddenly the waiter reaches underneath his jacket and... pulls out a small handgun.

Ramirez comes out the door and starts toward the stairs. Ramirez suddenly bangs into a DST agent. The two of them look at each other in shock for a beat. Neither was expecting the other to be there. The moment seems to last forever. They are literally face to face. Which one will react first? Ramirez takes half a step back, raises his gun and fires, exploding the DST agent's forehead. Ramirez has a moment of horror, splattered with the blood and brains of this man. We Intercut a flash of the DST man being hit in an instant, almost subliminal replay as if Ramirez's brain must register the scene twice to comprehend it. Just then, a shot rings out from below and Ramirez, who can't help staring in horror at the dead man, flees once more for his life.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out another clip and re-loads.

Ramirez comes out of the doorway and waves down a taxi. Ramirez jumps into the driver's seat, pushing the driver aside. When the driver resists, Ramirez throws him out into the street.

Then, instead of lifting his head out, he flushes again and the water level lowers.

Just then Ramirez manages to kick back and overpower Koj and send him flying back out through the door of the stall. Ramirez is back on him in a second but Koj has his gun up and pointed right at Ramirez's head. They have shifted position now, so that they are not facing the stall, but the door of the bathroom. Koj is about to pull the trigger when we HEAR:

Ramirez ducks and rolls out of the way and Amos fires two shots into Koj's chest but not before Koj can get off a round right into Amos' chest. In an instant Ramirez is on the still- alive Koj grabbing his head in his hands and slamming it down onto the edge of the sink with a thud that cracks his skull. He quickly crosses to Amos who is dying.

A taxi pulls up in front of Ramirez's house. Ramirez steps out of the taxi dressed in his Navy uniform and carrying his sea bag. He does not have a hat on and we SEE his head while not bald, is now in the shortest of buzz cuts, certainly much shorter than the way his wife last saw him. He stands outside the house looking at it like an adult who has come back to his boyhood home and finds it suddenly so small. Just then the door opens. There is Maura holding the baby and next to her, Joey. Ramirez runs toward them and they to him and we SEE them in tableaux, embracing. An idyllic family reunited.

We begin on a shot of Ramirez's chair. It rocks back and forth violently as we PAN UP and SEE Ramirez, who is fucking Maura. They are both fully clothed, skirt hiked up, fly unzipped. This is not lovemaking. He is fucking her brains out. It is passionate, rough sex. Maura hits high "C" as Ramirez sweeps books off of a table, lifts her out of the chair and lays her out on the table. The two of them climax together. It is clear from Maura's look that this is the best sex she's ever had. Ramirez slowly rolls off her. He is smiling as well, and then becomes aware that Maura has begun to cry.

He gives Joey "five" and Joey runs out to join his team at their dugout. Ramirez starts walking about toward Maura and the baby. As he does, he crosses next to another father, FRANK, who is with his son TYLER. Frank is about six foot four and to say that he is competitive would be the understatement of the year. He is haranguing his kid as if this were the deciding game of the World Series. He is on one knee so we don't see just how big he is.

<DIRECTION>
But before Frank can complete the sentence and strike his child, Ramirez comes flying through the air with a kick planted straight to Frank's head. It is sudden and violent and brutal. He comes down and with one side-kick, "knee-caps" Frank, which is to say he hits the top of Frank's kneecap and breaks it so that it is down around his shin. Frank starts to drop but before he can, Ramirez grabs his ears and brings his head down into his own swiftly rising knee. The result is devastating and Frank's nose is now all across his face. Blood is everywhere and Ramirez does it again. Now the object is Frank's teeth, so that when his head comes off of Ramirez's knee, his mouth is a mass of blood as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In slow motion, Ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in horror at what his father has just done. At the same time, maura is up and grabbing onto Ramirez. Ramirez however is not done. Frank is completely defenseless now and Ramirez leans him back across his knee, pulls him by the hair exposing his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be slaughtered. This time instead of a knife, it will be a karate chop from Ramirez which will crush Frank's windpipe and kill him. But before he can deliver the blow, Maura grabs his arm. He turns to her, almost about to hit her or throw her off and the two of them are face to face as Ramirez looks from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he has plunged.

He looks at her almost in disgust. She sees the look and slaps him. Faster than she could ever have considered, he slaps her and sends her back into the wall. She holds her cheek. He is an inch away from her face and now he is about to show her Carlos, to become him in front of her.

	I've murdered people. Not safe and clean and surgical firing a missile from some ship, but close and with my hands so their blood splattered on me... so their brains splattered on me. And they weren't the enemy, Maura... they were Allies. They were on our side. It was just to keep a cover... I've betrayed everything I ever believed in. I've betrayed you... I've fucked other women... I've killed men... There was a woman I would have killed but I just ran out of time. I've let friends die... I've become a terrorist... and I've made you and the children a target. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Do you see me now? Do you see the monster? There's another one worse than me and he is out there and he will kill you and the children if I don't kill him first... . That's my job, Maura. And if you don't mind, I'm late for work.

You'll be dropped near the mansion... as soon as she goes in, you make as if you're sneaking out... the Russians will be watching. You'll go to the meet. It's at that beer hall, there... see?

At twenty-one fifteen a Volga with diplomatic plates, DC- four-five-nine-two will come by the northeast corner of the compound. It will slow down... you jump in.

<DIRECTION>
A tram wipes the screen to reveal Ramirez, on his motorbike, followed by the KGB car. The landscape is desolate, with drab row-houses. Ramirez gets to a red light. As it turns green he sees the KGB car in his mirror. He jams across the street, just barely fitting in between two criss-crossing streetcars. Ivan and Andre lose sight of Ramirez.

INT. BEER HALL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The large bierstube is crowded, noisy and enveloped in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke. Its lively, at times rowdy clientele is in various stages of intoxication. As the loud, oom-pah-pah-pah band plays popular German music, those who are not too busy eating, talking, or emptying liter-sized beer steins, sing along.

RAMIREZ'S POV

Through the jam pack, the profile of a man, with a Tyrol hat who sits along the back wall. Busy eating, he seems totally oblivious to the hoopla around him. We can't really see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON RAMIREZ
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he cautiously approaches what he thinks is Jack. It isn't him. There is a sudden look of panic on his face and then he spots Jack also in the same kind of hat. Lifting his head, and turning to face Ramirez, we too recognize him. Under the hat, and the new heavy eyebrows and mustache, is... Jack. He smiles, takes off his hat, and motions his quest to sit down.

He lies in the thick bushes, completely obscured from anyone's view and now he removes the blond wig and the rest of his disguise. Underneath his "disguise" clothes, he is wearing a pair of black jeans and black T-shirt. He looks exactly like Carlos now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRODUCTION NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. THE REAL CARLOS HAS NOT DYED HIS HAIR BLOND. THIS WAS NOT THE REASON FOR RAMIREZ PUTTING ON A BLOND WIG. THE LOGIC HERE IS THAT IF THE "REAL CARLOS" WERE IN FACT GOING TO A MEET WITH A CIA AGENT, HE WOULD HAVE PUT ON SUCH A DISGUISE TO MAKE SURE HE WAS NOT SPOTTED BY THE RUSSIANS.

Illuminated only by the light which filters through the open door, the room is quite dark. A faint sound of SNORING reaches Andrei from the bed closest to the door. Quickly there, his arm goes up.

The voluptuous blonde -- her body glazed with post-coitus sweat -- is paralyzed with fear; covering her prized assets seems the last thing on her mind.

Glued to the back of a tree, the Jackal cuts them down with one short burst and goes for the KGBs who appear at the broken window. As they take cover, he quickly confiscates a Kalashnikov from the dead KGB closest to him and makes it to the high wall which encircles the place.

Carlos climbs over the wall with the Kalashnikov and drops outside the compound to the grass below.

He sees to his horror that Carlos is getting away. He is ready to scream, going crazy. He has no gun, he wouldn't stand a chance against Carlos, but there is no way he is going to let him get away, no way. He looks around for a rock... anything.

There is nothing. Carlos turns his back. Ramirez sees his chance, he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when suddenly he sees two more KGB guys come running around the wall of the compound.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramirez has Carlos down and is choking him. Carlos looks up at him more shocked than anything else. Finally Carlos manages to break the grasp and kicks Ramirez off. Now it is a dazzling display of martial arts. Then Ramirez charges Carlos and tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and darkness. When they roll out of the bushes we have no idea which one is which or who we should be rooting for. Just then Jack's Volga drives up at the side.

They roll over onto the bodies of two dead KGB. There is a Kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the Carlos on the bottom's side. The Carlos who is on top manages to get his finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into the Carlos on the bottom's body. Just then the Carlos on top looks up and sees Jack standing over him with a gun pointed at him ready to shoot. In b.g. we HEAR cars with sirens approaching. The Carlos on top looks over to Jack who is ready to shoot him.

He turns around and starts to get into the Volga. The Carlos on top, whom we just thought was Ramirez bends down and reaches for the dead KGB's pistol.

ANGLE ON JACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around, his gun raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol. Is it Carlos or Ramirez, who is standing there with pistol in hand almost turned to Jack but still at a disadvantage in this Mexican stand off.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the pistol knows this is a password of some kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he doesn't have an answer. Jack is just about to shoot him when a burst of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and it rips into the tree next to Jack who dives for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That act of self-preservation gives the man we now realize is the real Carlos the chance he needs. With catlike grace he dives, rolls and vanishes into the shadows. He has gotten away and Jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry or rescue his friend. He opts for the latter, scoops up Annibal and throws him into the Volga and speeds off as cars approach from the other side.

	No it wasn't. He's finished. The KGB bought it. As far as they're concerned, he's the enemy now. He'll bounce around from one country to the next. But his paymasters have disowned him. None of their client states will risk using him. No one'll trust him again. He'll spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder waiting to be betrayed. And it'll happen... sooner or later... when it's to some country's advantage... they'll give him up or they'll trade him. He's finished. It worked and he's finished.

The cemetery is set up for a funeral. There are various Navy officers and their families in the chairs.

He has escaped the danger we all come to know in the service of our country. He is about to go to church with his beloved family and in an instant... they are no more. They are with God. Our minds cannot comprehend such tragedy... only an undying faith in the Almighty a faith that says even though we cannot see it, there is a plan. That and the knowledge that as in life, so for eternity are they together...
