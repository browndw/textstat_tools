People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.
</DIRECTION>
<BUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The corner grocery's a supermarket. Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this place. Where's the pride of ownership here? Where's the personal service? Does anybody work here?

</BUMPY>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display window full of Japanese stereo componentry.
</DIRECTION>
<BUMPY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out, buying direct from the manufacturer - Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks - putting Americans out of work?

He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.

	This is the problem. This is the way it is now: You can't find the heart of anything to stick the knife.

</BUMPY>
<DIRECTION>
Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in. They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody call an ambulance!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of. Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -

INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>

The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here: a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem gangster, Robin Hood and killer.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER_ON_TV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a Great Man, according to the eulogies. A giving man. A man of the people. No one chose to include in their remembrances the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson: Gangster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER_ON_TV>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment, heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners circling the place like vultures:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you otherwise? Things okay financially?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.
</DIRECTION>
<BANKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bumpy set something up for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANKER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.
</DIRECTION>
<TANGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while you're at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANGO>
<DIRECTION>
Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango - who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.

</CHARLIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people here owed Bumpy money when he died. A lot of money. If they think I'm going to forget to collect, they're wrong.

	That's the spirit. Go get them.

On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."

	Just throw it in, he doesn't take it. That's good service.

They reach a particular motel room door. Rivera knocks. The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to close the door -
</DIRECTION>
<RIVERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw it -

</RIVERA>

As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his hand. He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame.

The door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in. The wise guy - Campizi - hurries for the bathroom, slams the door. This one's hollow and the detectives more easily break through it -

Campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window. Richie grabs him, throws him into the shower stall, taking the plastic curtain down with them, smearing it with blood as Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off.

Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand - which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi. The paramedics manage to pull him away.
</DIRECTION>
<CAMPIZI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can we do, Richie? You don't want to do this. For old times sake, what can we do? Who do you want? Who can I give you? You want Big Sal's bookie? You want his accountant? I'll give him to you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Richie regards him a moment. A policy ring's accountant wouldn't be bad. He glances back to his paramedic dabbing at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking. She smiles back.

He pushes the voucher under a sign - "All Handguns and Narcotics Before 10am Next Window" - to a clerk who takes it past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts. Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie unwrapped with dangling tags.

INT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback, Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<TOBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBACK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine hundred and eighty thousand.

<TOBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to the rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBACK>
<DIRECTION>
It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place - who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback walks over to the captain, and, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<TOBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing counting this in front of everybody? Are you out of your fuckin mind? Take it into a room. Now.

Richie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked.

INT/EXT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>

As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him - knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect, but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off. INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY

Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.

<TANGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you see the jar, Frank? I think you walked right past it.
	</DIALOGUE>

Frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats. Tango sits.

	The money jar. On the corner. What I got to do, put a sign on it?

Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango.

Frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look that says that won't be happening.

Right now Tango is dead. No doubt about it. On the surface, though, Frank remains cool.

	Of every dollar. Every VIG, every truckload, every girl, every ounce. In the jar.

</TANGO>
<FRANK>

	Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm giving it to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business.

Frank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango.

<FRANK>

	There. That's twenty-percent.

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) Stitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a pot, put it on the stove. (O.S.) A pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures. But no matter how many times Frank does the arithmetic, there's not much left, he calculates, after he pays the Italian suppliers and, if he were to, Tango. (O.S.) Richie has moved to a small desk cluttered with law textbooks. He cracks one open to study for the New Jersey Bar exam as he eats the soup out of the pot he heated it in. Above him on the wall is a framed photograph of Joe Louis standing over a sprawled-on-the-mat Billy Conn.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bleak day. Seagulls fighting over scraps on the sand as others hover overhead, flapping and cawing. Alone near the water, Frank tosses a stick for the German shepherd he inherited. (O.S.) Richie opens a small wooden box in his bleak apartment, revealing an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers and clips. As he rolls a joint -

	He's got the stick - the cane - and he'll use if he has to. But most of the time he doesn't have to. He moves the whole herd - quietly.

	What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, the middlemen, buying direct, putting Americans out of work ... This is the way it is now, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>

Frank nods. The vender hands him a napkin. The shepherd is still with him, but Bumpy is gone, and the gulls and the people on the roller coaster squeal as Frank comes out of his meditative trance with an idea.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE-UP: (DOCTOR'S OFFICE)
</DIRECTION>

A needle pierces the crook of Frank's arm. Slight grimace. A cotton ball is pushed onto the puncture. Malaria shot. CLOSE-UP: (PHOTOGRAPHY SHOP)

As they dive to their knees to do what they're told, Laurie walks away with her son, who looks back over his shoulder at his father with his gun out. (O.S.) Frank sits in the back of a motor samlor. Bicycles dart around it like flies.

INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some, his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in a kind of shock, more to himself -

	That's not what I want.

	No, even then it's too late. It's been chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A motley bunch of Thai thugs and black American soldiers with automatic weapons ride mules through the dense jungle with Nate and Frank, who - armed with a pistol, a rifle and ammo bandolier like Pancho Villa - is enjoying himself. From his POV, the jungle canopy suddenly opens up on a poppy field the size of Manhattan. Frank stares down at it.

On the ground now with their small private army, Nate speaks with one of the Thais, then translates for Frank.

Some of whom they can see down below on the opium farm - Chinese soldiers with outdated weapons. Frank tips his head to Nate at some other figures below -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They ain't Chinese.

A handful of better-armed American sentries at the perimeter of the farm. CIA. Frank, Nate and the others hang back as one of the Thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas.

	I don't believe a word of this.

<DIRECTION>
The general regards the cash and paperwork again for a moment. And, to Frank:

	After this first purchase, if you're not killed by Marseilles importers - or their people in the States - then what?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there'd be more. On a regular basis. Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every time.

EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects - the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark 30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive heat. It's riot weather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drugs on a coffee table. Body on the floor. Rivera, despondent, on the couch. The male paramedics, scared. Richie on the phone -
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant, I'm not asking, I'm fuckin telling you: Get some patrolmen over here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him. Richie throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<PARAMEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got no back-up? Why is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>
<DIRECTION>
The only other person who would know the answer to that is Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bandage his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<PARAMEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective ... he's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARAMEDIC>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his head, clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he's sitting. And open his eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step back, injured man coming out. Let them do their job and he'll be all right. Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney: tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<RIVERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIVERA>
<DIRECTION>
The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him up against a car.

Richie, disgusted with him, lets go of him. Rivera is embarrassed, almost crying, pleading -
</DIRECTION>
<RIVERA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Rivera suddenly tries to get tough -

<RIVERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, Richie? Fuck you, you make that kind of accusation against your own kind. And you know why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIVERA>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out his car keys, turns to leave. Comes past Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a line of puncture scabs and scars.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a disgrace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>

Richie squeezes Sander's hand so hard the car key cuts through the skin, drawing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMY BASE, NEW JERSEY - DUSK Silence. Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a perimeter fence. Frank waits by the car as a military Jeep with its lights out comes across a firing range. It slows, stops. In it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black, armed with M-16's. Silence again, before:
</DIRECTION>
<ARMY_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARMY_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the Jeep to his car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The duffel bags, still closed, on a table. Frank regards them, nursing a drink, putting off the moment of discovery that he has perhaps spent his life's savings on nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The German shepherd watches as Frank removes the tape from one of the bags. He pulls it open - has almost no reaction - except to breathe again - then opens the next, and the next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we see: Several brick-like packages of No. 4 heroin wrapped in paper marked with Chinese writing, stamped with a label: two lions on their hind legs, paws on a globe, and, in English: DOUBLE UOGLOBE BRAND 100%.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The duffel bags are elsewhere. The only evidence of any drugs is the small amount Frank has given a chemist - who looks like a Harvard student - to test. It responds instantly. The young man looks at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<CHEMIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Typically what I see is 25 to 45 percent pure. I've never seen anything like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants, no dilutents. It's a hundred percent. May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEMIST>
<DIRECTION>
The chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up, but Frank gives him some to take home instead.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it with you. I don't want to have to call the coroner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The chemist gathers his things to leave, offering a last piece of advice -
</DIRECTION>
<CHEMIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Store it in a cool, dark place.

EXT. GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clapboard house set down on a piece of land that was probably once worked by sharecroppers. An elderly woman framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts like patches of rusty snow. Crickets and bullfrogs. From a mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. The kid's got a major league arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legend: Greensboro, North Carolina
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glow spills out from a detached shed where a short man in his early 30's works on a stock car.

Divorced couples in custody battles wait with their attorneys in a packed courthouse. An lawyer carrying papers clipped with a $10 bill, comes past Richie, who's sitting with his lawyer, a woman he's probably slept with.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEILA>

EXT. HOUSE - TEANECK, NEW JERSEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house. His neighbors - those he can see - are white. He hears a sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where a sold "For Sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here, the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives and kids, and their mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for trespassing. The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each of his startled brothers.
</DIRECTION>

INT. FRANK'S TEANECK HOUSE - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is alive with the noise of family and scent of home-cooked food as the extended Lucas clan - there's more than twenty of them - sits around a big dining room table passing the platters around. Frank, at the head of the table, clearly loves having them all here.
</DIRECTION>
<TURNER>

	This is your room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

Mrs. Lucas is in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its furnishings. It's unlike anything she's used ever seen - not Graceland exactly - but not far off. Her eyes settle on an old vanity dotted with French perfume bottles.

	I was with him every day for fifteen of them, looking after him, taking care of things, protecting him, learning from him.

The brothers can't help but notice the storekeepers who wave to Frank, the women who smile, the men who step out of his path like there's a red carpet under his polished shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bumpy was rich, but never white man rich. Why? Because he didn't own the company. He thought he did. He didn't. He only managed it. Someone else owned it. So they owned him.

INT. DINER - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his brothers eat lunch, Frank - who can see Tango outside - uncaps a glass sugar container.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What matters in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never forgetting where you came from.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all sugar from the container onto his plate.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are what you are and that's one of two things. You're nothing ... or you're something. Understand what I'm saying?

EXT/INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes out of the diner, crosses the street toward Tango, who's buying fruit. Greets him cheerfully -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Tango, what's up. I was just thinking about you. I was looking at the jar and you know what? I didn't see nothing in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<TANGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck you want, Frank -
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANGO>
<DIRECTION>
Before the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a gun pressed against his forehead. Silence. Everyone backs away - the bodyguard, too. Tango's girl pulls her arm from his and takes off. Eventually -
</DIRECTION>
<TANGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you going to do, boy? Shoot me in broad daylight? In front of everyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TANGO>
<DIRECTION>
It's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves; everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants. As Tango laughs at the thought -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the cops. Should be enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place. Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar.

Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. Toback levels with him -

<TOBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective.

	Doesn't matter.

	No, they're all on the take and I'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you.

	It's fucked up. You're right. Maybe this's an opportunity away from all that.

They regard each other. Eventually -
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it, but only like this: I don't set foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk.

INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A still-powerful older man in a nice suit rises from his chair to wild applause. From the stage -
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Joe Louis, ladies and gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, and sits back down as the band starts up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At another table, Frank sits with Charlie Williams and Rossi, slightly older dope men. Like Frank, they favor expensive tailored suits. Their dates, too, are nicely dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. Frank's glance moves from Joe Louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the beauty queen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is a beauty queen. No kidding. Miss Puerto Rico.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her glance crosses Frank's briefly but is yanked to the entrance of the club when Frank's brothers come in with their wives and girlfriends. Teddy's in a parrot green suit, gold chains, hat, acting like he owns the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK ROOM - SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER

Frank hustles Teddy into an empty back room.

</FRANK>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with Jackie. I like Jackie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like Jackie? You want to be Superfly? Go work for him, end up in a cell with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy pulls himself from Frank's grasp. Smooths his shirt, adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy making all the noise in the room is the weak one. That's not who you want to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<TEDDY>

</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

</FRANK>
<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not about you. We were talking. He said he wanted to talk to you about something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Frank clearly wants nothing to do with Jackie Fox.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TEDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Joe Louis has come over to speak to Frank at his table.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a tax thing. It's a mistake my lawyers will straighten out, but for the time being it's a headache -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_LOUIS>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much you owe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JOE_LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing, like - fifty grand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Frank isn't sure if it's an honor or a curse to have a celebrity like Joe Louis asking to borrow money, but nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Don't worry about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JOE_LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I'll pay you back soon as -

</JOE_LOUIS>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan. You don't owe me nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie glides into the club with his magazines and entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a sentry. Frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. Doc knows the look. Gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER - NIGHT

Frank comes into the coat check area where Doc waits with his overcoat. As Frank slips into it, Miss Puerto Rico - returning from the ladies room - comes through.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NEWARK - SAME TIME - NIGHT

A club across the river. Not nearly as nice as Small's - much louder - but like Small's, almost all black. Richie shares a booth with a black undercover detective.

Richie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with his skinny white date.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEARMAN>

	That's Abruzzo, with the fat black one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPEARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Richie sees a young Italian with tatoos - the only other white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman. Both Jones and Abruzzo look more like criminals than cops.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEARMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both are good with wires. Have good informants. They're honest. And they're fearless. They'll do anything. They're insane, Richie, like you.

Frank gets out before Doc can, and escorts Ana to the car.

<FRANK>

	I hope you weren't waiting long. A woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have to wait for anything.

	You really don't know who that is?

</FRANK>
<ANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he do?

</ANA>
<FRANK>

</FRANK>
<ANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was he to you?

</FRANK>
<ANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he teach you?

	Our mandate is to make major arrests. No street guys - we want the suppliers - the distributors.

Spearman, Jones and Abruzzo sit in the back, looking like delinquent students. Of everyone in the open ground-floor that's been only slightly renovated - and there are about fifteen of them - they're the most disreputable-looking.

	Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No grass under a thousand pounds. Less than that, someone else can waste their time.

At the perimeter of the base, black servicemen transfer heavy taped-up duffel bags from an Army Jeep to a station wagon, hoisting those that won't fit inside onto a roof rack. Two Lucas brothers tie them down with twine. INT/EXT. CAR / HIGHWAY - NEAR WASHINGTON DC - DUSK

Air conditioner full blast. Radio announcing the time: 4 o'clock. Frank glances out the wet windshield of the Chevy and watches 116th Street transform:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls. Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts, tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware. Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably filthy rooms, plunged into veins -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THE REVERSE:

<DIRECTION>
10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered to the Lucas brothers, to:

	We're going to be here all night if we count every bill.

The penthouse is now richly decorated. The R & B music playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system.

The banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is beginning to make him uncomfortable.

	What is that, a bribe? Oh, now you're all under arrest.

The cop pretends to arrest them all, but what he doesn't pretend is the hand he puts on Jimmy's girlfriend's breast as he frisks her.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
It was quick but Jimmy saw it, even though his girlfriend didn't react. The cop, oblivious, is cuffing Teddy now.

The room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his fingers onto the carpet. Frank stares.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	Oh, he's all right. I just shot him in the leg. You got a health plan, what are you complaining about. He's fine. Here -

</JONES>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a cop the uppermost thing is the arrest. For a prosecutor, the arrest is nothing without the evidence to convict. We don't have any real evidence on anyone on this board, so they're coming down. We're starting over from the street.

INT/EXT. SPEARMAN'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - DAY Spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic change lanes up ahead - heading for the George Washington Bridge - and glances over concerned to Richie, who is changing the cashmere sweater for an old t-shirt.

As Spearman follows the truck, the George Washington Bridge, linking Jersey to Manhattan, looms in the windshield ...

EXT. EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who has to double back quickly not to be seen
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck. Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.

The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic, screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple car-lengths ahead - in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EAST HARLEM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza parlor. Richie climbs out, crosses the street. Coming past the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair - the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they come past Richie -

	Yeah, I know, like everyone else. Some of them will steal no matter what. There can be a camera on them they'll do it. Some'll never do it. The rest are capable of either, depending how their department leans ... Only theirs isn't leaning, it's fallen over. The patrol cars don't even stop in Harlem, just roll down the window so the dealers can throw the money in. I saw drops made on precinct steps.

Droplets snake down Frank's glass. He senses Tosca has finally gotten around to why he was invited here.
</DIRECTION>
<TOSCA>

	Bumpy and I did a lot of business together, as you know. Whatever he needed, he'd come to me and I'd do my best to provide it. He came to me, I didn't go to him, is the point I'm trying to make. You know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't have what you needed. You had what he needed. We've always had to come to you.

	Which is a little mom and pop store compared to what I'm talking about. I could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A., Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I'm speaking nationwide. And I'd guarantee you peace of mind. You know what I mean by that.

Frank does. It's a backhanded threat. Tosca clips the cigars with a gold guillotine
</DIRECTION>
<TOSCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. You can see I'm a Renaissance man. Unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil rights, they don't know. They're not as open to change from the way things are done and who's doing it. But I can talk to them so there won't be any misunderstanding. That's what I mean by peace of mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOSCA>

Frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad.

<FRANK>

	You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd consider 50. And I can get you as much as you want.

Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him.

	You see, I was right. This is a historic moment. You're going to be bigger than Bumpy himself.

A TV: Muhammad Ali, the black man's black man, and Joe Frazier, the white man's black man, at their 1971 Madison Square Garden press conference where Ali says as much.
</DIRECTION>

Most of the guys watching it. Richie isn't. He comes over to Table of Organization. Tacks his Bar Association notice to it. Regards the photographs, like tentacles of octopus yet to have a head.
</DIRECTION>

Only the lowest section is made up of blacks (including Charlie Williams and Jackie Fox, but not Frank Lucas). The rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up. They've hit a wall they can't get past.

INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another TV here: Howard Cosell, ringside at the Garden as the first early fans arrive, pointing out that the fight, because of the political stand Ali's taken, is less about boxers than war versus anti-war.
</DIRECTION>

Frank chooses a linen jacket from his extensive color- coordinated racks of Phil Cromfeld suits as Ana, in her lingerie, puts on make-up at a vanity. He comes up behind her and sets down a small jewelry box.

She crosses past the TV, takes a garment bag down from her side of the closet, lays it on the bed next to Frank's suit jacket. She takes hold of the zipper but doesn't immediately pull it, hoping perhaps to create some dramatic tension.

Louis acknowledges Richie only slightly more than not at all. Turns away to join his friends. Richie watches after him, stung by Louis's disregard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps a picture of an Italian wise guy he doesn't recognize ... sifts the camera's view past Frank in the chinchilla coat ... then returns to him, watches as Tosca and his guys sit down behind Frank. Richie can't hear - but can see - their good-natured exchange -

	Hey, Frank, you keep that hat on, I'm gonna miss the fight -

The odd thing to Richie is, Chinchilla's seat is better than all the Italians'. Detective Trupo notices this, too. Richie focuses on the Chincilla's date, a stunning girl, a beauty queen, then shifts back to her boyfriend who's now shaking the proffered hands of other Italians, then Don King. Joe Louis himself - who barely acknowledged Richie's existence - comes over and playfully exchanges "punches" with the man in the chinchilla coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden roar from the crowd as the lights go out except for the spot on the ring. Ali and Frazier are coming down the steps through the crush of fans and reporters, preceded by soldiers carrying flags -

Richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring -
</DIRECTION>

Flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla coat, focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light, and snaps the shutter -

INT/EXT. TRUPO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A doorbell summons Trupo. He comes through his entry. Opens the front door. Finds no one there - except a large live turkey on the doorstep. He stares at it nonplussed, then looks up to a sound - a whoosh - as flames engulf the interior and spit out the windows of his Shelby Mustang ...

Jimmy comes out, tries to take a chair not too far from Frank who's watching his nephew toss pop-up flies for the younger kids to catch.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stevie. Come over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the nephew comes over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you didn't show up. You're too busy to meet with Billy Martin? After I set it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie shifts around, not wanting to make Frank mad ...
</DIRECTION>
<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to play pro ball, I decided.

	Maybe I can set it up again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Stevie just stands there, uncomfortable. Finally -

<STEVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not what I want. I want to do what you do, Uncle Frank. I want to be you.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JACKIE FOX'S CLUB - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie's club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film. Frank and Teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey carcasses and other remnants of Thanksgiving to where Jackie and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Girls, get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
The girls gather their things and leave. Frank wipes at a modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away, sits. Jackie lays out a couple lines, offers Frank a rolled up hundred dollar straw. Frank shakes his head, no thanks.
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You talked to Charlie. You want to hear more about my Black Coalition. Let me explain it to you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<DIRECTION>
But first, let me suck up a line of coke -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not why I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Jackie glances up from the powder. No?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody's happy, Jackie. Charlie, Baz, the cops, the Italians, everybody. Everybody except you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I don't understand. Why do you have to take something that's perfectly good the way it is, and wreck it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie doesn't seem to understand.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brand names mean something, Jackie. Consumers rely on them to know what they're getting. They know the company isn't going to try to fool them with an inferior product. They buy a Ford, they know they're gonna get a Ford. Not a fuckin Datsun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his look says, right?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blue Magic is a brand name; as much a brand name as Pepsi. I own it. I stand behind it. I guarantee it and people know that even if they don't know me any more than they know the chairman of General Foods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you talking about, Frank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you're doing, as far as I'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
That. That's what this is about. Jackie nods, but -
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all due respect, Frank, if I buy something, I can do whatever I want with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. That's where you're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I buy a car, I can paint it, God damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jackie, you don't need to. You don't need to make more money than you can with Blue the way it is. No one does. At a certain point it's just greed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want, Frank? You want me to call it something else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to insist. You call it Blue Magic, that's misrepresentation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. I'll call it Red Magic, even though it doesn't sound as good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I'm saying. Wrap it in red cellophane and -
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pink Magic. Black Magic -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whack it down to nothing, tie a bow around it and call it Blue Dogshit if you want, just don't let me catch you doing this again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jackie regards Frank for a long moment ...
</DIRECTION>
<JACKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch me? Insist? Infringement? I don't like these words as much as please - thank you - sorry to bother you, Jackie. These are better words to use you come into my place without an invitation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACKIE>

Jackie waits to hear a kinder word but Frank doesn't offer one. Jackie nods, Fine, okay, but it's more like a warning.

Teddy doesn't like it, but nods. Suddenly his face is illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, pull over, what are they going to do? Give us a ticket?

<TRUPO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to come over here a minute, Frank?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light. Frank and Trupo regard it in silence. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<TRUPO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what are we gonna do about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRUPO>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna shut the trunk and say good night, forget you pulled us over.

Trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank -

<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck is a `micro' wave?

<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of anything. Of popcorn. You don't want to put your head in there.

Tony rakes out the plain, `pre-microwaveable' popcorn, using his hand. Gives some to Richie. Half of it's burnt.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there something we can do - about leaving the big guy alone? You know who I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>

What Richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at this point he's got a problem.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>

She stares at him in disbelief. Then responds in a louder voice than his -

The bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>

Ana looks vulnerable. Frank almost feels bad that it's his life and problems that have put them here. Eventually, to try to turn it around -

Frank's car approaches Small's just as Jackie, with a Santa Claus hat on, climbs out of a sky blue Bentley with his entourage. Frank groans to Doc -

INT/EXT. CHINESE PLACE - CONTINUED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank pushes in past the doors with Ana, the windows explode. They dive to the floor, bullets ripping through the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc draws his two guns and fires back at the car, hitting it a couple times as it screeches off. He gathers Ana and Frank off the floor like a presidential bodyguard, hustles them out to the car. Frank's shoulder is bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hit?

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brothers watch as a private doctor attends Frank's wounds. He seems all right fine except for the fact that someone had the fucking nerve to take a shot at him - and Charlie he sees in the newspaper - gunned down, dead, lurid Weegee-like photo of him on the front page.

Trupo's attitude has completely changed from the first time they met. He talks to Richie now like a fellow conspirator -
</DIRECTION>
<TRUPO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From what I hear, it was the Corsicans. The French Connection, Fernando Rey, the exporters Frank has put out of business. Now, I can take care of him in New York, but I don't want to have to worry every time he drives across the bridge to Jersey someone's gonna take another shot at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRUPO>
<DIRECTION>
Richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that Trupo would speak to him this blatantly.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUPO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to start working together. We need to step up our efforts. Next time their aim could be better. We need to keep this cash cow alive.

</TRUPO>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy Racine comes in - sees Trupo - and leaves - but not before Trupo has seen him. And now he sees the Lucas Table of Organization he didn't notice when he came in. Gets up and walks over to it now and takes a closer look. Sees Frank's picture at the top, like Enemy Number 1.
</DIRECTION>

A large TV shows chaotic scenes in Saigon. The US is pulling out of Vietnam. Tosca has come to see how Frank is recovering, and finds him, agitated, too long in bed even though it's only been a day, changing into a nice shirt, putting on his shoes -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I can guarantee you peace of mind," you said. Do I look like a man with peace of mind to you? They shot at my wife. Who does that? Who was it, which one of your people? I'll take that gun away and shove it up their ass.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know that it was any of them, Frank. Neither do you.

Tosca seems more philosophical about it - like Bumpy might have been - but it wasn't him who was shot at.
</DIRECTION>
<TOSCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know who it was? I can tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival. Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name for himself. Or someone you forgot to pay off. Or slighted without realizing it. Or someone you put out of business by being too successful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Success has a lot of enemies. Your success is who took a shot at you. How you gonna kill it? By being unsuccessful? You can be successful and have enemies, or unsuccessful and have friends. It's the choice we make.

The same farm and hut as before. Frank and the Chinese General sip tea. The four million dollars in cash Frank brought sits on the table.

EXT. JUNGLE - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They seem to have made it, winding back down through the jungle with the mules. Suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts from the trees - a couple of Nate's men are hit as the rest dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire. Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

Nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the noise.

</FRANK>

Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais and Americans lying dead on the ground.

	The warrant permits me to search the plane and its cargo.

The captain doesn't comply. Richie moves to open the coffin himself and every soldier's shouldered rifle immediately comes into firing position, aimed at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARMY_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you don't have my permission.

</ARMY_CAPTAIN>

Richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding them, safeties off, fingers on the triggers; all they're waiting for is their commander's order to fire.

Trupo regards the shepherd snarling at him from behind the kennel fence. Comes around back. Pushes at the frame. It moves a little, like it's levered -

INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - CONTINUED

With the rifles still pointed at him, Richie kneels down, pulls the latches of the coffins, half expecting to hear an accompanying barrage of gunfire. He lifts the lid. Sees a long black body bag inside -

INT. AIRPORT HANGER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie and Toback sit before the Federal Attorneys and customs agents. The US Attorney hangs up a phone ... then:
</DIRECTION>
<US_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a military transport plane. If there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved. Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</US_ATTORNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Richie's in serious trouble and knows it. As does Toback.
</DIRECTION>
<US_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how these events are being interpreted by General Easton in that call to me. That someone employed by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</US_ATTORNEY>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are drugs on that plane -

</RICHIE>
<US_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</US_ATTORNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors.
</DIRECTION>
<US_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking transport plane? That's what you've accomplished Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</US_ATTORNEY>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.

</US_ATTORNEY>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank Lucas.

</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly.

<US_ATTORNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Who's Frank Lucas?
	</DIALOGUE>

Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before -

	Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</US_ATTORNEY>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to his defense -

<TOBACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richie has a lot of experience -

Toback watches as the detectives follow after Richie striding toward his car.

	Frankie -

Frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room. Nods to Doc to say, Get the car, I'll be out in a minute. Goes over to his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LUCAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_LUCAS>
<DIRECTION>
He sits. She studies him in a way she hasn't since he was little. Eventually -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LUCAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd have been a preacher, your brothers would be preachers. If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. Do you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he doesn't say)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They all came here because of you. You called and they came running. They look up to you. They expect you to always know what's best.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)

	But even they know you don't shoot cops. Even I know that. Ana knows it. You seem to be the only one who doesn't.

	Is that where I'm going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MRS_LUCAS>

	I never asked you where all this came from because I didn't want to hear you lie to me. Don't lie to me. Don't do that, too.

She's not pleading, she's telling. Silence. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LUCAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really want to make things so bad for your family they'll leave you? Because they will. She will -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points upstairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_LUCAS>
<DIRECTION>
Frank has some trouble looking at her. But then gets up. Walks toward the front door to leave. Hesitates near it a long moment. Then turns and walks upstairs. Trupo will live, at least for now, because of her.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down in the basement, the body bags are lifted from the wooden coffins. Set down on tables. The bags unzipped and the bodies removed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rack of clean uniforms is brought in. The morticians begin dressing the corpses and applying make-up on the dry gray skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
New white military caskets are trundled in. Gold handles lifted. The bodies, clothed and painted now, are deposited on the silk linings. The lids of the coffins come down and cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white caskets are taken to a loading dock, put in a military truck. Papers are signed, copies exchanged. As the truck drives off - INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two black privates on janitorial duty come into the room where the original plain wooden coffins have been discarded. They remove the lids, then the finely-crafted false bottoms, revealing in 4-inch cavities of each, tightly-packed bricks of Double UO Globe heroin. As they take them out, a gospel choir begins and continues over: (O.S.) A laundry truck idles. Stevie, the Lucas nephew who could have played for Yankees, jumps down, helps the two privates toss several laundry bags into the back of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A minister on the steps welcomes the congregation which includes Frank, his mother, and Ana - (O.S.) The laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base, drives past a stand of trees. As it passes, Richie, parked by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his T.O. photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. The detectives follow at a distance -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) The sea of ladies' hats from above move in time with the gospel choir. As always, no matter what else is going on in his complicated life, Frank sits with his mother and Ana in their usual pew. The gospel music continues over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and Ana and put them in a car with a driver. He climbs into Doc's alone. His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends to go kill Trupo after all. As Doc's car leaves, so does another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. RICHIE'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The laundry truck approaches a ramp leading to the George Washington Bridge. Richie, a couple of car lengths behind, follows. The truck continues straight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) From overhead, the laundry truck, the gun car and the van - and the detectives' cars following them all - converge from different directions -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEWARK - NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red Top's van makes a turn. As Abruzzo's makes the same turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up in his windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he sees Jones's car slow. Teddy's car approaches from another direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the foreboding towers. The gospel music ends.
</DIRECTION>

Several black and white and undercover cars approach, sirens off. Toback himself climbs out of one of the cars and hands Richie the search warrant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell. The place is like Beirut. Debris-strewn, graffiti-covered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - FLOORS - SOUTH TOWER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the sound fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks up to the guys with the guns.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SPEARMAN>
<DIRECTION>
As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the floor. The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets. Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy, panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back - crawling across the floor like an infantrymen -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his pistol. But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls echoing in the stairwell. He starts down, taking the stairs five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into an apartment. Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is goes out onto an exterior balcony - Richie continues along the interior corridor, running parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but the door to the balcony is nailed shut. So are the windows. Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and, just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him, hitting him in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls hard, dazed. Richie hurries through the broken window. Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks his femur with his bare hands. Teddy howls in excruciating pain -

Frank, on a wooden folding chair at Bumpy's grave, hears the gunning of engines and barking of cops. He turns to see Doc being handcuffed on the ground by the Towncar. Glances to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. Richie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie arrives at the grave. Regards the monument to Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him. Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>

INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - DAY Richie cuts the tags off a new, inexpensive suit. Slips the jacket on, which seemed somehow to fit a little better at the store. Cuts the tags off a tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTHOUSE MENS ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone throwing up in a stall. The toilet flushes, the door opens and Richie steps up to a sink, regards his face in the mirror. Under the fluorescent lights - maybe under any kind - his skin is a shade of death. He splashes water on it and tries to gather himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the prosecutors table, Richie steals glances at the battery of expensive attorneys over at the defense table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The courtroom doors swing open and Richie sees Frank Lucas, in a tailored suit, escorted in without cuffs by an amiable- looking federal marshal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons, stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings, heroin in blue cellophane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Champ hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and Richie wonders if he should just give up now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old mother giving him a hug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask, Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can you see how insignificant you are?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Roberts -

</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here he is, let me talk to him alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The attorneys get up and leave. Richie takes their place. Frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile from the courtroom. Richie offers nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just heard something. I said it couldn't be true. You didn't really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk of a car, did you?

Richie doesn't say. Frank searches his face for some clue to where on earth he's from.

	You did it because it was right. That's all. Why's that hard to say? The question is would you do it again? That was a long time ago. It'd be very easy to find out. Tell me you want to find out, tell me the address, and a car will be there, the trunk loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Richie knows Frank isn't kidding ...
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank suddenly explodes -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are you to say no to that? You think that impresses me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the outburst is through. Richie remains serene. Eventually -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you something. You think by putting me in jail, you're going to stop even one junkie from dying? Because you won't. If it isn't me, it'll be someone else. With me or without me, nothing's going to change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then that's the way it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have any sort of case? Or just that idiot drives for my brother. Is he your case? Because if it's just him and the powder, it's not enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you got nothing to worry about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
But Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't take money sitting placidly in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brothers won't talk to you. My cousins. None of my family. No one but that mother fucking driver.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got more than that. I got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it? Tony the Bug. Benny Two-Socks. Carmine Camanetti.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are they? I don't know them and they don't know me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They sell dope for the Mazzano crime family. Which you all but put out of business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is who you're going to put on the stand? Guys who don't know me? Who got nothing to do with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have everything to do with you. And the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't represent nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't? Black businessman like you? Of course you do. But once you're gone, things can return to normal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. You looking? Can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life. He wants to work something out with Richie obviously, but he can't figure out how. Frank studies him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what you have to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can do it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could give you cops, but that's not who you want, is it. You want organized crime names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take them, too. I want them all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank isn't sure he heard right.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll take them, too? You'd go after cops? Are you serious? You'd do that? Lock up your own kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not. Not the ones in business with you. They're not my kind any more than the Italians are yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
They regard one another in silence. Richie can tell Frank sees daylight.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you promise me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison. Lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out. You can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what I can promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is silent for several moments. Finally -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't care if the feds take all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore accounts. They can take it all, I don't care - use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the fuck they want. Fight another war. But those other motherfuckers - the cops - put my money in their pockets. Millions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank debates with himself the step he's about to take ...
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years. Everyone you sold to. Every cop you ever paid off. Every one who ever stole from you. Every one you remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I remember them all. That's not the problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The jail's aren't big enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL / STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surveillance photographs of cops seen earlier taking envelopes of money on 116th Street and other drops go up on a new, elaborate Table of Organization - of cops. (O.S.) Richie dismantles the Lucas Table of Organization here, taking down the photographs. As it collapses -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - CONTINUED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank puts up photographs of detectives -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS of the same detectives, in handcuffs, led through police stations past other cops watching with dread like maybe they're next -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surveillance photograph of the four Princes of the City striding down a sidewalk goes up on the cell wall -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHCUT as three of the four SIU cops are led away in cuffs from a golf course - A surveillance photograph of Trupo in a black hand -
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go up here. Your "special."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank tapes the picture of Trupo at the top of the pyramid of corruption -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. TRUPO'S GARAGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trupo, coffee in hand, comes into his garage from his kitchen. Opens the garage door and sees two squad cars parked outside ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TV: A report on the indictments handed down by the Manhattan DA's office against 53 NYPD and SIU detectives -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CELL - DAY (YEARS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank gathers his few personal belongings and puts them in a box. Stands with the box and waits for the cell door to open. The Table of Organization and files are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legend: Frank Lucas was convicted of Conspiracy to Distribute Narcotics and sentenced to 70 years. He served 15 of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legend: Federal authorities confiscated over 250 million dollars from him in real estate, equities and cash in US and foreign banks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie, too, is packing, putting personal items into boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legend: The day after he convicted Frank Lucas and 30 of his Country Boy relatives, Richard Roberts borrowed $400 from his credit union to help pay for a 3-day vacation to the Bahamas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richie, carrying the box, switches off the lights and closes the door behind him on his way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Legend: Six months later, he quit the Prosecutors Office to become a defense attorney. His first client was Frank Lucas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON - DAY (1990)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but the cardboard box in his arms. Looks out across the parking lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up. Sees Richie by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 116TH STREET, HARLEM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same corner Frank shot Tango. Frank looks up at the street signs that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue. Now they say 116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was wrong with just plain 8th Avenue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He considers the street itself. It too has changed. The corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to sit here with Ana in my old car. She hated it. Now I don't even have a car. Or her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and across the street to where he shot Tango. It isn't a fruit stand any more.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck is that? Just do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
It's a Nike store with huge paintings of Michael Jordan and the admonition "Just Do It."
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sneakers. Expensive ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck would buy those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
A car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past. Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at the discount emporium.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brothers know you're out?
	</DIALOGUE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't talked to them in years. It's better that way. For them. I don't know where they are. Went back to Greensboro when they got out, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Richie nods. Frank looks back at the new storefronts.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I going to do now, be a janitor? What do I know how to do? How am I going to live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I wouldn't let you starve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told me but you can barely take care of yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances to a pay phone on the corner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, one phone call, Richie, I could be back in business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The look Richie gives him calmly assures Frank if he did that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't. I'm just saying I could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He buttons the cuffs of the fake Members Only windbreaker Richie bought him off the street.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy pants, bandanas tied around their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh. Look out. Here come the gangsters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. The gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on Frank's face, thinks better of it. The others stop.
</DIRECTION>
<GANGSTA_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANGSTA_2>
<DIRECTION>
The first one is still staring at Frank, but finally has the good sense to let it go.
</DIRECTION>
<GANGSTA_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GANGSTA_1>
<DIRECTION>
They move on. Frank glances to Richie.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every idiot gets to be young once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank zips up his Members Only jacket, props up the collar and points himself in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
