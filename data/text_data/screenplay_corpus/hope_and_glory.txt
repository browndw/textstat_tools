INT. ROHAN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - SEPTEMBER 1939 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raking down a line of suburban gardens lit by a late-summer sun. Heads move back and forth above the fences that divide the narrow strips of land, moving to the sound of unseen lawn mowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one of these gardens two children, BILL (aged eight) and his sister SUE (aged six) disport themselves. They are sprawled out on the lawn, heads and hands intent on something hidden from view in the lush vegetation of a rockery garden. Beneath those flowers and plants is a dark and mysterious forest, shaded by huge leaves, and broken up by towering boulders. Mounted figures of medieval knights ride in, guided by BILL'S gigantic hand. A wizard appears in the path of the riders who draw up sharply. BILL gives an impression of neighing horses. SUE'S face looms up between large leaves. She makes the sound of spooky wind.

INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the penumbra of the room, the mother, GRACE, in droopy flowered frock, crosses, floats towards the walnut wireless and, with trembling hand, switches it on. Its green dial glows with stations like Droitwich and Hilversum. She glides back and drapes herself behind an armchair in which her husband, CLIVE, sits solemn and motionless.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the lawn-mower ceases abruptly. BILL looks up sharply. The neighbours' heads come to rest on top of the garden fences. They turn, listening. BILL inclines his head towards the french windows, sensing the dread moment. He walks towards the door and is framed there. He regards his parents.

They look back with unseeing, inward-turned eyes. Young BILL gathers confused fragments of the fateful announcement.

The boy catches his mother's eye. She smiles en embarrassed smile. The boy is embarrassed by her embarrassment. His father's glassy solemnity angers him. In the garden, SUE sings.

An older sister, DAWN, a tumescent fifteen, stumbles into the room in a nightdress.

Her mother, GRACE, interrupts her with outstretched arms.

GRACE says it as though announcing that dinner is served, but her voice is torn by a sob as she holds DAWN in her arms.

</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	German planes! German planes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
They run out. GRACE sweeps little SUE into her arms, buring her face in her bosom and rushing back into the shelter of the house. DAWN and CLIVE scan the sky for planes, There are none.

DAWN lunges at BILL. The GRANDMOTHER enters, tall, frail, elegant, ga-ga, deaf.

The wireless begins to play 'God Save the King'. Father immediately lets go of the children and stands rigidly to attention. The others simmer down and shuffle into stiff and still poses. GRANDMOTHER, who perhaps cannot hear the Anthem, is baffled, shakes her head.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sirens sound. A shocking blast of noises, the sickening ululations of the air-raid warning. They call out over the rows of bow-fronted semidetached, lower-middle-class houses. Some of the occupants, more daring or more confused than their neighbours, burst out of their front doors, turning in frenzied circles, craning at the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rigid family once more jerks into movement at the sound of the siren, looking forcefully out of the french windows, hiding under the table, clutching each other. The siren stops. They wait, anxiously. Silence. Even the birds stopped singing at the wailing of the first siren. This was perhaps the worst moment of the war, the first moment, when war was still an unknown dread thing. The siren again, but this time, a long sustained note.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
A Ministry of Information film advises and demonstrates how to glue strips of paper to windows to avoid flying glass, and how to construct an air-raid shelter. On the soundtrack, in addition to the patronizing commentary voice, is the sound of hundreds of screaming children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL and SUE sit among the children's matinee audience. The children pay no attention to the screen, but fight and shout, throw things at each other, jump over seats, cry, wander up and down the aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soundtrack changes to dramatic music and a transformation takes place. All movement and talking ceases. Hundreds of rapt faces stare at the screen where Hopalong Cassidy rides into action.

The windows are criss-crossed with brown paper. Beyond, in the garden, MAC has taken off his jacket and is shovelling earth onto the shelter. BILL walks barefoot towards the house, carrying his wet socks and shoes in his hands.

INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAWN lies in bed, head buried in pillows in that deepest of all sleep, the Sunday morning adolescent lie-in. BILL shakes her, jumps on top of her, imitates an air-raid warning, tries to pull off the bedclothes but she holds them tight.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a soldier at he door, looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
She whips back the sheet, wide awake. One look at his face is enough to see that he is lying.

	If there's no soldier, I'll have you instead.

CLIVE appears having stripped to the waist but wearing his Sam Browne from the First Wold War. They all shriek with laughter. CLIVE, encouraged by this response, does drill movements and then demonstrates how to salute.

	There are many ways of saluting..

(he demonstrates.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..An old soldier insulting a young subaltern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
His hand flies to his forehead, gouging the air, the salute transformed into an obscene gesture. More laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As an officer, you counter that with one of these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his arm slowly and languidly until his limp hand just brushes his temple. A faraway look in his eyes disdains any acknowledgement of the insulting salute. A tiny skirmish in the class war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL and SUE swing on the leather straps of the Sam Browne. They want him to stop. They sense something dangerous, alien, their father in an unfamiliar role, another person.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wireless has been on all this time, playing music and now come the chimes of Big Ben. It is news time. The adults are suddenly stock-still and serious, leaving the children stranded in an excited state..

The meal has been eaten. They are animated again, but more reflective, DAWN is winding wool with GRANDMA. BILL and SUE have also left the table. BILL is looking at the Sam Browne, now slung over the armchair, with its tangy smell of deep polish like shiny milk chocolate, a mysterious icon of war. The conversation at the table drifts over to him.

Later. The two men are in post-prandial sleep in the armchairs on either side of the fire. Sounds of washing up and women's voices come from the kitchen. BILL walks up very close and examines the two warriors from the Great War, or the First World War, as it was now coming to be known. Their mouths are open, slack. His father's false teeth click up and down as he breathes. MAC shifts his backside in his sleep to let a fart up from the side of the leatherette armchair. BILL looks at CLIVE's mottled skin, the stubble, the sagging epidermis around the eyes. He goes to the mantelpiece and takes down a silver-framed picture of his father as a baby-faced second lieutenant wearing that same Sam Browne. BILL holds the picture next to his father's snoring face. Once again, a new bulletin begins on the ever-playing wireless.

Infantry advance as shells bust all about them. CLIVE and MAC push forward, side by side. MAC is hit, goes down, cries out for help, but CLIVE does not seem to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A muddy field. Silence. Aftermath of battle. BILL searches among the dead. They are half-buried, covered in mud, all one texture with the earth. BILL finds CLIVE and MAC, lying side by side, dead. He is quite unconcerned, pulls his father's Sam Browne which slips off easily. He wipes the mud away and starts to eat it. It seems to be made of chocolate.

A 1938 Vauxhall 12 is parked outside a recruiting centre. A boisterous crowd of young men mills about, passing in and out, encouraging each other, cheering each new man who steps out a soldier. Next door is a pub and there is a continuous exchange of customers between the two establishments. BILL and SUE wait inside the car. She is whining in the back, sucking her thumb. BILL sits in the driving seat, pretending to drive, making all the right noises.

He flicks the ball out of his wrist. BILL nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the leg-break?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
BILL knows that too. The ball comes out of his hand, spinning the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.

CLIVE, now some twenty yards away, looks back. BILL throws the cricket ball and CLIVE catches it neatly. He smiles and marches down Rosehill Avenue. BILL is puzzled as CLIVE shows no sign of returning the ball. He calls after him.

CLIVE is now eighty yards down the street. He suddenly turns smiling broadly, and with a prodigious throw he send the ball in a high arc towards his son. BILL juggles his position, cups his hands, gets under it as the hard, heavy ball hurtles downwards. At the last moment he loses his nerve and jumps back, letting the ball thump onto the lawn. He looks towards CLIVE, full of shame. BILL is relieved to see that CLIVE has turned the corner.

BILL winces as he and SUE are passed from hand to hand, hugged and kissed by many female members of the family - DAWN, GRANDMA and GRACE'S three sisters, FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY. MOLLY is on hand with MAC, the only male. On the table are the remains of the farewell party, an iced cake, balloons, gaudy wrapping paper. Encouraging cries fly about. "Aren't you lucky?" "Isn't it exciting?" "I wish I could hide in your suitcase." From the smothering embraces, BILL casts a pleading look to MAC who reaches out and hauls him from the women.

MAC and GRACE lead BILL and SUE into the concourse where hundreds of children are assembled, each wearing an identification label. The noise is overwhelming. The organizers shout into megaphones. One buy has fainted and is put on a stretcher by St. Johns Ambulance men and, to get through the crowd, they hold the stretcher above their heads. The boy recovers, sits up and waves to his friends. The parents throng behind the barrier and they follow him. WOMEN'S VOLUNTARY SERVICE (W.V.S) Volunteers stand by.

They are sucked into the enclosure and quickly disappear among the throng of refugee children. GRACE tries to follow with her eyes, searching for them hungrily. They disappear. MAC flinches at the pain he sees in her face. She lunges forward, and tries to push through the barrier.

The W.V.S. WOMAN and an ARP MAN are forcibly holding her. MAC cannot bear to watch her pain. He leaps over the barrier, grabs SUE and BILL and hoists them out of the pen. BILL is acutely embarrassed at the scene his mother is making. He struggles to get free of MAC.

GRACE pins the newspaper cutting to a bulletin board which also displays a 'war map' with pins in it showing the progress of hostilities. The cutting is a David Low cartoon showing a soldier standing defiantly on a rocky promontory looking across a stormy sea towards France, saying 'Very well alone.' She is deeply moved by it. BILL enters and watches her, sensitive of her mood, but he has a mournful duty. He takes out the pins, representing the German Army in Russia.

BILL looks up as he hears a voice groaning from a bomb site. SUE is now some way ahead. The street is suddenly deserted. He looks back at the bomb-scarred house. The front of the house is gone and flowery wallpapers are revealed. The voice cries out again, a panting, rasping moan. BILL ventures forward. Now a WOMAN'S VOICE, groaning.

A white hand and forearm stretch up from the debris. BILL shifts position until he can SEE TWO HEADS, a MALE and FEMALE, pressed against a mattress which is leaning against a broken wall. He darts back on the street and looks for help. The street is still deserted. He hesitates, then runs up the street for all he is worth.

BILL and SUE are late. They run into the yard where the other children are already lining up in their respective classes. The HEADMASTER is a wizened Welshman, too old for military service. He struts up and down.

BILL covertly shows the welts on his hands to his neighbour as he and thirty other nice-year-old children are harangued by a large red-faced woman, their TEACHER. She sprays a lot of saliva as she speaks. A coloured linen projection of the world is hung over the blackboard. She slaps it with her cane, pointing to many countries .

The children file in mostly, laughing and chatting. There are clattering duckboards on the ground affording cover from an inch or two of water. Along each side of the shelters are narrow benches.

BILL and SUE turn into their street on their way home from school, looking lifeless and dull, but their faces lights up with excitement as the fifty-foot length of a BARRAGE BALLOON suddenly rises from behind the houses to the distant SOUND of CHILDREN CHEERING. They sprint into their house.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ROHAN HOUSE - DAY

BILL and SUE run through the hallway and into the living room, scattering satchels, hats, gasmasks in their wake. Their excitement is far too intense to explain to the startled GRACE. They burst out through the French Windows into the Garden.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run to the back fence. In the waste ground beyond the garden, where a further row of house was to be built when war intervened, BILL and SUE witness a TEAM of mostly AIRWOMEN, (WRAFS) intent on launching the BALLOON Some twenty WOMEN, each holding a tether, are paying out their lines under the rhythmic commands of their LEADER. There is a c able attached to the winch mounted on a TRUCK, and this is wound out as the balloon rises. The balloon has a comforting, humorous aspect, and the children laugh and giggle as they watch.

Suddenly a caption is superimposed on the screen:

A number of PEOPLE have come out of their suburban gardens and look up at the pale-blue-winter sky. GRACE, SUE and BILL are among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SQUADRON OF SPITFIRES is attacking a formation of GERMAN BOMBERS. They are distant black dots high above the barrage balloons. The planes WHEEL and DIVE and give a splendid display of AEROBATICS. Being so high, there is almost no sound of engines or cannon and the feeling of unreality is heightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - FRONT GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the GERMAN PLANES is HIT as the PILOT leaps from his burning plane and a PARACHUTE blossoms and checks his fall. GRACE draws the children back into the corner of the house as the PLANE CRASHES. They creep out again. The dog fight continues but the German planes have lost formation and dispersed. The battle has become straggly and is rapidly disappearing from view. Meanwhile, the PILOT'S PARACHUTE drifts ever CLOSER as he descends, causing great excitement.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PILOT drifts on to the wasteland where the barrage balloon bravely flies. People rush in from all sides, as he makes an elegant landing and gathers his parachute. A crowd of women, children and OLD MEN encircle him. He looks no more than twenty-years old. The crowd watches every move he makes. They edge back as he reaches into his pocket. But it is only a silk handkerchief that he pulls out. He wipes his hands, puts it away. He moves to an empty oil drum and sits on it. He crosses his legs and carefully lights a cigarette. His affects the greatest nonchalance as he smokes. A little way off a huge hoarding gives the impression of the houses that were to be built on this site, an idyll of suburban bliss. The PILOT looks at the idealized family group on the poster and then at GRACE and her children. He smiles ironically.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	England is so beautiful, and he had to land here of all places.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, a rather aged POLICE CONSTABLE arrives on the scene. The onlookers thrust him forward. He advances a few paces, the stops. Hesitating, quite at a loss. He looks at the PILOT then back to the crowd. They egg him on. Resolutely, the CONSTABLE pulls out his truncheon and steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now then. Now then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTABLE>
<DIRECTION>
The German PILOT gets languidly to his feet. The POLICEMAN Retreats a pace. A TITTER or two ripples through the crowd. Encouragingly, the PILOT half raises his hands in the 'stick- em-up' position, the cigarette held delicately between the pale fingers. It is a taunting but oddly gentle gesture. The CONSTABLE takes him by the arm and leads him off. The crowd opens up to let them pass. As he does, DAWN catches his eye and he winks at her. She gives him a flirtatious smile. GRACE is horrified. She seizes DAWN and forces her face against her own breast, hiding her gaze from the lewdness of the enemy.

</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dawn! Come down here!

</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts back up the stairs, but is halted by a BOMB dropping close by. She runs down again, scoops up the two little ones and heads from the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROHAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach the French windows, another BOMB EXPLODES very close by. Before its sound is heard, there is a tremendous BLAST, which rips off the blackout curtains and sends them floating into the room. The WINDOWS are TORN OUT and most of the fragmented glass hangs limply from the brown paper that criss-crosses the panes for just this eventuality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every loose object is hurled inwards. The room light flickers on and off and shell-bursts illuminate the room from without. GRACE and the children are thrown back against the wall, but before they hit it the process is reversed and the blast is sucked out again. They are pulled back towards the windows together with the glass and loose fragments of the room. This all happens slowly as though the room is filled with water and the windows were a reversible sluice gate. SUE'S long blonde-hair is first blown, then sucked across her face. Then comes the SOUND of the EXPLOSION itself, Which seems to have the effect od draining water from the room. The People and the bric-a brac all drop to the floor, dead weights once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children clutch their ears, SCREAMING. GRACE has one or two cuts. She gathers up the children, spreading her blood on them, and frightens herself, confused as to whom the blood belongs. She wipes it away, crying out a desperate prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, God. Take me, but spare them.

</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She carries SUE and drags BILL through the shattered French windows, out into the garden and towards the Anderson shelter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROHAN HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more BOMBS EXPLODE, further way, but still close enough for the blast to force them off balance. They stumble and fall, covering their ears against the pressure. They tumble into the SHELTER, stepping into several inches of water. The ack-ack keeps up the barrage, and the EXPLODING SHELLS intermittently LIGHT UP the SKY. GRACE, mumbling Dawn's name, clambers out of the shelter to fetch her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE sees DAWN coming down the garden. She looks dazed as she staggers quite slowly with one arm wound around her head. As she gets closer, GRACE sees that her eyes are glazed and she is MOANING. GRACE leads her into the SHELTER and covers her with a blanket. SUE is fast asleep already in spite of everything. DAWN looks at her mother accusingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DAWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't care if I die. How could you leave me there? Even if you don't love me?

</DAWN>

DAWN desperately wants her mother to take her in her arms, but GRACE sits stiffly upright, unyielding.

Finally DAWN bends forward and puts her head on her mother's lap and cries, at first softly, the more bitterly. GRACE holds her and rocks her at last. BILL watches this, perplexed, as perhaps he always will be, by the complex emotional interplay that passes between women.

BILL picks up shrapnel. Several houses have been damaged, one heavily so. Outside this house, a handful of people has gathered watching the ARP MEN as they comb through the smouldering ruins. Two of them are working a stirrup pump as they extinguish a small fire in a corner of a room. Some children come up to BILL and SUE. They are flushed and excited, bursting with news. One buy, ROGER, blurts it out.

He points over at the ruined house, and sure enough there is PAULINE, a girl of twelve. From time to time, a silicosis NEIGHBOUR goes over to her, offering help, but PAULINE shakes her head and looks away. She just's stands there as though her mother has told her to wait on that spot and not to talk to any strangers until she got back. The children drift across towards her and stop a few feet away. They stare intently, studying her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that right? You're mum got killed last night?
	</DIALOGUE>

PAULINE nods affirmatively. A BOY throws a miniature parachute into the air. It opens up and drops neatly at PAULINE'S feet.

<ROGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are. I told you.

</ROGER>
<DIRECTION>
He jabs BILL in the ribs, finding a physical vent for his excitement. BILL lashes back at him with a violent anger that scares and quells the other boy. The group falls silent.
</DIRECTION>

PAULINE steals glances at them out of the corner of her eye. She is not a popular girl, careful and self-conscious, and she cannot help enjoying this situation. She flushes.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel rotten, Pauline?
	</DIALOGUE>

PAULINE shakes her head. The children move away from her and start to fool around, scrapping and laughing, but when they get back within a certain distance of PAULINE, they grow quiet and move away again. BILL nudges SUE.

GRACE'S arm is bandaged, MAC is scoring panes of glass with a diamond cutter. He has a dollop of putty. BILL is immediately distracted and cannot resist kneading the putty.

The gang loot and pillage, smashing as they go. Behind a piece of broken wall, BILL discovers a soldier and a girl clasped together, the girl is pressed against a door. BILL moves closer. The soldier fumbles with her clothing, but she is so wild with passion that his efforts are impeded. BILL registers the familiar gasps and cries that he is becoming accustomed to hearing from the injured, the dying and the coupling. The girl moves her head and her face becomes visible over the soldier's shoulder. It is DAWN. She sees BILL as he sees her. She mouths the words: 'Go away'. He turns to shake and cry. He moves away, then on an angry impulse picks up a stone and throws it. The soldier lets out a cry. He turns revealing himself as BRUCE.

BILL throws friendly punches, one wild one catches him in the crotch. He takes it bravely. He distributes largesse, a tin of corned beef and a packet of tea for GRACE, chewing gum for SUE, a model barrage balloon for BILL and a pair of nylons for DAWN.

We were beat so bad, discipline was all to Hell. We told the soldiers to jump in the briny. There was no grub but we broke into the wine stores, and everybody got smashed.

We had to wade out to the boats and he was so heavy he couldn't haul himself up. He slipped and sank like a stone.

CLIVE, leather helmet and goggles iced up, rides to the Rohan House on a Norton motorbike. The street is snow- covered and the road is covered in brown slush. BILL and SUE run out to greet him. He dismounts painfully, his huge army greatcoat is also rimmed with frost. His face is so stiff with cold that he cannot crack a smile and presents an intimidating figure to the children, who draw up short. When he speaks, he can hardly form words. He staggers alarmingly from the stiffness as he walks, and cramp in one leg makes him hop up and down.

CLIVE has changed into civvies and is soaking his feet in a bowl of hot water. Tea has been laid and the family assembled. They watch CLIVE warily. They have learned to live without him and his reappearance has upset the new ballance.

The table falls deathly silent. They stare at the can as though it was a time bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIVE>

	It's all right. It came from a German chip. It got sunk, and this stuff washed ashore, crates of it. Jam. Our fellows found it on the beach, by the rifle range.

</CLIVE>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
The eyes turn on CLIVE. The situation forces their resentment for one who has not shared in their hardships, who abandoned them, in fact. The jam has become a test. He looks into the faces of his family. Resolutely, he takes up a teaspoon, picks up the can and begins to eat. Grimly and steadily he ladles the jam to his mouth. They watch him carefully for signs of pain. Before their doubts are dispelled, he has consumed a third of the can. BILL is the first to crack.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us some, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>

CLIVE stops eating, puts the can back on the table and they all dig in. The tension is dispelled. SUE climbs on CLIVE'S lap and he feeds her himself. They laugh and chatter and stuff bread and jam in their mouths.

The kitchen door is open, admitting thin winter sunlight. GRACE works within. Outside, CLIVE is cleaning his kit, helped by BILL. Belt and gaiters are balanced and laid out to dry. CLIVE is sitting on the steps, putting dubbin on his boots, BILL polishing his father's hat badge, totally absorbed in its beauty. GRACE appears, outs a hand on CLIVE'S shoulder, closes her eyes, let's the sun caress her face.

<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.

	Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.

<DIRECTION>
Cries and shouts come from the street. BILL swings across a crater on a dangling electric cable and scrambles into the road. There is panic and pandemonium. The local barrage balloon's fins have punctured and it has lost stability. It is careering wildly like a kite out of control. CLIVE and MAC clamber into the street as the balloon skims across the sky, its steel cable shearing a chimney stack which tumbles down onto the front garden sending people scattering in all directions. BILL runs up, mad with excitement, as SUE and DAWN come out of the house with GRACE and MOLLY and look up. CLIVE sprints across to them.

Two ARP MEN run down the street, urging people to go inside. The family retreat grudgingly towards their house, but hover in the front garden watching and laughing. Six HOME GUARDS march into Rosehill Avenue at the double. The balloon has risen into the sky and the people are drawn out again into the street, looking up. The HOME GUARDS come to a halt and raise their rifles.

The GUARDS form up again and fire at the balloon. It bursts into flames. The shreds of burning cloth, followed by the spiralling cable, plunges into the street. There are cries if regret and the family and others step forward to inspect the smouldering remains with the same sadness that is felt at the end of a firework display.

BILL and SUE each have a torch, which serve as a searchlight. BILL smokes a woodbine and he blows the smoke around the suspended model aircraft. Spitfires, Hurricanes, Messerschmitts, Heinkels are picked out in turn. As they appear,BILL simulates their engine noise. With considerable dexterity, he uses his free hand to fire his ack-ack guns, and papier-mache pellets, pre-soaked in ink, fly through the air. BILL animates a distressed plane plummeting to earth. His triumph is interrupted by a TAP at the window. Expertly he dogs his Woodbine then goes to the window. He opens it and DAWN steps through. He is about to close it after her when BRUCE'S face appears. BILL lets fly an ink pellet catching BRUCE square on the forehead. DAWN holds up a threatening hand and the children shrink back as BRUCE clambers in. The two of them tiptoe into the next bedroom, DAWN throwing a warning glance over her shoulder.

BRUCE raises his head and presses his grotesque face to the window. He taps on the glass. He is startled to see the assembled family standing upright and staring back at him without expression. He cavorts and waves his arms, but still gets no response. Sheepishly, he slinks into the porch and pulls off the stocking. The door opens to reveal DAWN.

A charade is in progress. CLIVE and MAC are got up as prostitutes, wearing their wives' clothes. GRACE and MOLLY are dressed as men. There is a lot of salacious flirting and an argument breaks out over the price of whores. MOLLY says the word 'tart' emphatically and BILL jumps out of his seat, yelling:

CLIVE and DAWN riding pillion, pull up at the Guard House on his old Norton. DAWN slides down and hurries to the Guard House. CLIVE props up the bike and follows her. A convoy of trucks pulls out of the gate. Soldiers lean out of the back of the lorries, cheering and whistling when they see DAWN.

EXT. ROSEHILL AVENUE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
As GRACE, MAC, BILL and SUE turn into the avenue, they see a house burning. It is theirs. When they get closer, they see it is gutted and the roof has collapsed. The firemen have hoses trained on it, but it is too hot to get into the front door. GRACE'S first thought is for her Daughter.

It is open at the picture of the two families at the very beach they visited yesterday. It is burned around the edges, only MOLLY and CLIVE are unscathed and they smile happily.

EXT. THE THAMES RIVERSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying GRACE and the three children, MAC's car draws up on the towpath facing an island on which is a number of wooden bungalows with verandas decorated in fretted scroll work. Neat lawns slope down to the river's edge where varnished punts and skiffs like sleekly tethered. GRANDFATHER GEORGE has spotted them and he rear-sculls his dinghy across the water to fetch them.

EXT. BUNGALOW - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grey dawn light touches the mist lying over a glassy river. BILL comes down out of the house and stands at the edge of the water: not a breath of wind, not a soul stirring. He slips out of his grandfather's voluminous pajama pants. Delicately, he lowers himself into the river, careful not to crack the perfect smoothness of the water. He slides slowly in until only his head is showing. He swims out into the centre of the stream, without disturbing the water. He stops, takes a breath then submerges, leaving not a ripple, never a trace. The dawn river is once more unobserved, its secret self again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNGALOW - BILL'S AND DAWN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

INT. BUNGALOW - DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room lets out, through open French windows, on to a back garden sown with vegetables for some yards and then giving way to orchard and pasture. The morning sun streams in. GRANDFATHER GEORGE sits at ne end facing the garden. GRACE, SUE, GRANDMA and DAWN flank him. GRANDFATHER GEORGE is not the best in the morning. He glares at BILL as he enters and slips quietly into his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDMA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMA>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nettle soup, like we did in the Great War. Very nourishing. Bill and I will catch fish. The river fowl will be laying eggs soon. We'll hunt, We'll forage. We'll overcome.

</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep still! Nobody move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
His aspect fills them with dread. His eyes are boring holes in the cabbage patch, outside the French windows, where a rat is crouching.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother!! Fetch my gun.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMA>
<DIRECTION>
He points urgently at where the gun stands against the wall. GRANDMA creeps on tiptoe over to the gun and hands it to him, resuming her place without making a sound. He raises the shotgun, aiming along the length of the table. The children are statues, only their eyes darting from him to the rat and back. The barrel is inches from their faces. He fires. They jump. Smoke fills the room, He curses under his breath, as the rat escapes. He puts down the gun and readdresses his boiled egg, as an afterthought, he turns to BILL.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never let a rat creep up on you.

<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE gives him a searching look, but BILL is all innocence. DAWN stifles a giggle. GRACE sees what goes on and suppresses a smile herself. BILL suddenly coughs and splutters to hid his laughter. DAWN goes red in the face, tears come to her eyes and her shoulders shake. SUE suddenly tinkles with innocent mirth and the suppressed laughter bursts out of them all. They roar and gasp and shudder and cannot stop. GRANDMA, quiet perplexed, smiles, happy to see them all so happy. GRANDFATHER GEORGE, eyes blazing with anger, glares at them disdainfully, but the dam has burst and, fear him as they do, the laughter pours out unabated and their eyes are filled with tears.

INT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE poles the punt up the river. GRACE, GRANDMA and SUE lounge in the cushions. BILL stands alongside the old man, learning the way of it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up, two, three. Throw the pole forward, let it slide through your fingers. Don't push until it hits the bottom.

BILL takes it all in.

BILL crawls along the shiny deck and hauls in a fishing line.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No luck, Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
He lets it out again. A wood-fired steam launch, all polished brass, with an elegant canopy, chugs past them. An elderly couple occupies it, seated in wicker armchairs.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(raises his cap to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, ma,am. Greetings Edward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
They are beguiled by the smell of the afternoon. GRACE trails her fingers dreamily through in the water. Willows, bulrushes, glides past.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.

GRANDFATHER GEORGE entrusts the pole to BILL. He struggles with the technique, does quite well. The the pole sticks in deep mud. He cannot extricate it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go. Let it go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
But BILL hangs on to the pole and the punt moves on until he is stretched between them. Finally, he hops on to the pole and clings to it.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay put. Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a paddle and drives the boat back to where BILL is stranded. The pole starts to topple in a small arc. GRANDFATHER GEORGE renews his efforts and BILL is able to step neatly on to the rear decking. The old an eases the pole from the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now there's a lesson for life. Never give up the punt for the pole.

EXT. GRANDFATHER GEORGE'S RIVERSIDE GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tea is being laid on the lawn by GRANDMA, GRACE and DAWN; GRANDFATHER GEORGE reclines in the faded swing-seat. BILL ferries FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY (his three aunts) to the island in the dingy. He rear-sculls with some difficulty, but well enough. GRANDFATHER GEORGE examines his daughters with binoculars as they 'ooh' and 'aah' greetings on their approach. They disembark and there is much hugging and kissing. They have all brought clothing for the family and dresses and blouses are held up, examined and admired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The daughters clearly disapprove of GRANDFATHER GEORGE and only offer perfunctory kisses, HOPE ignoring him completely. SUE is held up and passed from hand to hand as though she were a frock herself. They take it in turns to shout clarification to their mother. They flutter around DAWN, who is now showing her pregnancy.
</DIRECTION>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No word from Bruce, my pet?

BILL slides over to his grandfather.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All hens and no cocks. Too many women in the family. They're a different species from us, Bill. Love them, but don't try to understand them. That road leads to ruin. Let's make a nuisance of ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He mingles among the women, deciding to goad his daughter HOPE.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look frustrated, Hope. That husband of yours still can't rise to the occasion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
HOPE flares up, but bites her tongue and turns away. GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns to BILL, confidingly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't have the husbands here. All four married duds, including your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<HOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a menace. He ought to be locked up.

GRANDFATHER GEORGE continues his advice to BILL.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll tame you if they can, cage you and feed you tidbits. Better retreat to prepared positions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He leads BILL round to the back garden away from the river. All the bungalows are built up on piers against flooding. He reaches under the house and retrieves an old cricket bat and ball. He thrusts the ball at BILL.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bags I bat first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes guard against the trunk of an old apple tree. BILL twists his fingers around the ball and bowls a spinner to GRANDFATHER GEORGE who waits for it to break, then plays it back. The next ball breaks the other way and clean bowls him. GRANDFATHER GEORGE looks back at BILL with astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a googly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<BILL>

<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
With ill grace, GRANDFATHER GEORGE surrenders the bat and offers a harmless arthritic delivery which BILL thumps into the gooseberry bushes. GRANDFATHER GEORGE curses and pricks his fingers as he tries to retrieves the ball. He looks up irritably at the sounds of laughter from his daughters. He snarls in their direction.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?

<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.

He bowls again. BILL hammers it away. GRANDFATHER GEORGE glares at him, trembling with fury.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only a game, Grandpa.

</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE gets himself under control and trots off to find the ball.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL and SUE are in the dingy, pushing a stand of reeds. BILL hangs over and bows, hauling the boat along by pulling on the reeds. The parting rushes reveal a moorhens nest, neatly suspended above the water on bent-over reeds meshed together. There are some dozen speckled eggs. BILL carefully extracts one of them ad places it in a little basket in the boat, which already contains a number of eggs which he has presumably taken from other nests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further upstream, BILL steps out of the boat into some shallows. He gropes under the water and hauls up a night fishing line. SUE shares his disappointment when there is no catch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

The dingy pulls up at the landing stage. GRANDFATHER GEORGE, using a stick, limps down the garden to meet them. SUE hands him the basket of eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the fish? No fish, no supper. Be off with you and don't come back empty handed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives the boat a shove with his stick and turns back to the house. SUE looks weepy. BILL mouths some of his repertoire of swear words. From the dormer window, DAWN witnesses their humiliation. She laughs and waves. As GRANDFATHER GEORGE turns back to the house, she ducks out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They row up to the head of the weir. BILL casts a line and fixes the rod to the gunwale, He ties up the boat and slips over the side. He checks a net arrangement he has fixed at the base of the waterfall to snare unwary fish swimming over the weir. It is empty. SUE paddles in the soft weed that grows on the steps of the weir, letting it seep between her toes. BILL kneels and runs his fingers through the same luminous-green weed. They become absorbed in it. BILL lowers his body into the water and lets himself slide over the weed. SUE follows suit. Soon they have discovered a glorious game, sliding like eels down the weir and plunging into the pool below. Back and forth they go. In the far distance, an air raid siren wails, They pay no attention, so caught up are they in their pleasure. SUE checks the fishing line fixed to the boat. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared of going back without any fish. I hate Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
They look up at the SOUND of 'ack-ack' fire. BILL spots a German plane high above them.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like a stray bomber. He's lost his squadron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a BLAST OF AIR and a BOOMING EXPLOSION. Two hundred yards up the river, a great plume of water spurts up. They drop flat on the steps of the weir. BILL peers cautiously over the rim of the waterfall. SUE seems his astonishment turn to a broad grin. Floating towards the weir are dozens of fish stunned by the blast. Joyously, they gather them up and throw them into the boat.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL, now wielding the pole with great aplomb, send the punt gliding up river. DAWN heavily pregnant and languidly melancholic, lies in the cushions, bare foot dangling in the river. DAWN stiffens as the figure of a man in uniform comes running along the riverbank. As he catches up with them, he is revealed as BRUCE and the uniform of a Canadian soldier. He waves and calls them.
</DIRECTION>
<DAWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignore him, the bastard.

BILL hesitates, but a withering look from DAWN keeps him on course. BRUCE levels with them. He calls across thirty yards of river.

BILL whips up speed, keeping to the opposite side of the river from BRUCE, who wades out up to his knees and holds out his arms, pleadingly.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAWN>
<DIRECTION>
Fully clothed, his khaki cap perched on his head, BRUCE swims out towards the punt. By the time he reaches the middle of the river, they are fifty years upstream. BRUCE swims back to the shore. Dripping wet, he runs up the riverbank until he is well ahead of the punt and plunges in again. This time, his course coincides with the punt. He grabs the side of the boat and hangs on, out of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>

	Couldn't write...secret posting...came as soon as I heard about the baby.

She cracks the paddle over his head. He sinks under the water, his cap floats away. BILL rescues it. BRUCE does not reappear. They wait, become alarmed. DAWN kneels down, peers into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DAWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?

His head pops up inches from her face. Levering himself up on the boat, he kisses her on the mouth. She grabs his hair smothering him with kisses.

The bridal pair come out and the VICAR, considerably embarrassed, makes his excuses and backs away. A picture is taken. The REDCAPS seize BRUCE by each arm. DAWN clings to him, a last kiss, and he is borne away. They all stand at the church doors waving to him as he is driven away in a jeep. There is some dutiful sniffing from the women, but since DAWN seems quite happy, there is no need for sympathetic tears. GRACE impulsively hugs MOLLY.

	This boy will make his way in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE slaps BILL on the back with such enthusiasm that he sends the boy sprawling. CLIVE catches him, holds him close and whispers in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Cries of alarm come from the house. CLIVE hears his name called. They hurry back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men arrive to find the women in a state of alarm. They are gathered in a knot around DAWN. BILL pushes his way forward.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clive, go for the doctor. It's Dawn. She's in labour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
BILL peers between the women and catches a glimpse of DAWN standing arched against a chair, one hand supporting the baby's head which has appeared between her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot water! Lots of hot water!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIVE>
<FAITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What for?

</FAITH>
<CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. They always say that at the pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes out.

EXT. BUNGALOW - VERANDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLIVE runs down to veranda steps.
</DIRECTION>
<HOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just went to the toilet, and it came out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOPE>
<DIRECTION>
MAC joins CLIVE and they run to the boat and fumble awkwardly with the oars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRACE tries to be calm. She holds DAWN gingerly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now take deep breaths, and push.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DAWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAWN>
<DIRECTION>
BILL comes to SUE's side and they catch another glimpse of the baby's head. SUE wrinkles her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<SUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all sticky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUE>
<DIRECTION>
BILL passes clean out and crumples to the floor.

<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GROUNDS OF A GREAT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL is running flat out, running for his life. He passes a blurred orchard, a garden, a park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW BUNGALOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL, still running hard, looks over his shoulder and turns in to a bungalow that faces on to the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEW BUNGALOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is cheerful and spacious. Out of the window, the sun sets over the river. DAWN breast-feeds the baby, now a week or two old. GRACE knits a tiny pair of leggings. SUE is drawing a picture. CLIVE snoozes in an armchair. They are listening to Churchill on the wireless.
</DIRECTION>
<CHURCHILL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it is not the end. It is not the beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHURCHILL>
<DIRECTION>
BILL enters, flushed and panting. His eyes are bright with excitement. He goes to DAWN and, reaching inside his shirt, pulls out a peach and hands it to her reverentially.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I scrumped it. I nearly got caught. They chased me for ages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
DAWN take's it. It looks pretty miserable. Most of the furry skin has rubbed off during its hazardous journey next to BILL's skin. DAWN's first impulse is to make a sarcastic comment, but in her new maturity, she bites it back and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAWN>
<BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(blushing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for the baby, really.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.

INT. GRANDFATHER GEORGE'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE drives his old Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire along the river towpath. Beside him sits a very morose BILL wearing a school cap, with a satchel, gasmask, and a suitcase on his lap. GRANDFATHER GEORGE adjusts the advance/retard lever and glares at the sullen boy.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only till they get you into the local school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a film unit setting up equipment on the river bank. Extras dressed as soldiers - Germans, British, American - lounge, smoke and drink tea.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strapping fellows playing silly buggers with a war on. Outrageous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
BILL cranes back watching as long as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car draws up outside the school entrance. A grim wall surrounds the institution and BILL gets out, head hung low, and walks towards the gate as though to the gallows. GRANDFATHER GEORGE watches from the car. He grips the steering wheel angrily. A teacher strides past. GRANDFATHER GEORGE shouts after him out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you do is knock the sense out of them and fill them up with muck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BILL enters, he is astonished to see hundreds of children in a state of delirious celebration. Boys fling their caps in the air. They cheer. They whoop. They run amok. Behind them lie the smouldering ruins of the school. BILL cheers louder than anyone. He remembers his grandfather, turns on his heel and runs back to the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE is awkwardly turning the car in the road. He drives off. BILL runs flat out and comes up to the window, shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandpa! There's no school! It's been hit by a bomb!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE slows up.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to hand it to you, Bill, you come up with some good ones. Go back and take your medicine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He drives off leaving BILL stranded. A fire engine and ARP vehicles race up to the school. They pass GRANDFATHER GEORGE and doubt shows in is face. He stops, gets out. Boys are spilling out of school, cheering. BILL runs up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
They get into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER_GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
A barking laugh wells up and escapes his throat. It bursts forth in great waves like a flood that has been dammed up for years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER GEORGE's laugh, and BILL's too, ring out over the autumn river which beckons to BILL with the promise of stolen days.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
