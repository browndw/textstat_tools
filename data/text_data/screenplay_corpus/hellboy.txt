INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his seventies.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MATLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.

</DIRECTION>

</OLD_MATLIN>

Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MATLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have the negative.

</OLD_MATLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, dramatic effect.

INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MATLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...off the coast of Scotland. Classified mission. I was 21...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MATLIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform soaked in sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MATLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had an English civilian on board. Not much older than me but already an advisor to President Roosevelt. "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --

Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a small...

<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" an ancient set of Tarot cards.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MATLIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor --
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_MATLIN_S_VOICE>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Broom! Topside, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...
</DIRECTION>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sooner we're done, the better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much like a carpenter's tool box.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT CARD: THE DEVIL.

INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short tunnel carved into the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside Broom.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??

	In private, if you don't mind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the small box. It's full of rosaries.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your men -- They'll need these --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ contemplates the scene from above.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a Catholic??
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.

Whitman locks and loads an automatic.

</BROOM>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three days too late for that one, "professor."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has no eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the move. Broom catches up with Whitman.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --

<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!

</WHITMAN>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'll bet you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he sees lights.
</DIRECTION>
<MATLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS swarm among thick stone walls and archways.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must be here for the sheep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMONG THE RUINS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The freak in the gas mask --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>

<WHITMAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Air and sea backup. What's closest?

	We don't have forty minutes.

</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears respond!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and signals for more floodlights to be turned on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully extended.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter what happens to me, you must carry on with the work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you will... Leave me. Deny me.

</GRIGORY>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never --

</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand- drawn notes and illustrations.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will guide you back to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I grant you everlasting life, youth and the power to serve me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation and a ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_KRUPT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_KRUPT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_KRUPT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five years of research and construction, Grigory. Five years!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_KRUPT>
<DIRECTION>
He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella to shield her master from the pouring rain.
</DIRECTION>
<VON_KRUPT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The furhrer doesn't look kindly on failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VON_KRUPT>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There will be no failure, General. I promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll deliver one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Americans fan out, unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid a German foot patrol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight, We will open a portal and awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven Gods of chaos.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our enemies will be destroyed. In an instant, all impurity in this world will be razed and from the ashes a new eden will arise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORI>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the machine and whispers --
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He flexes his fingers and in response --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More Power!! Don't let the level drop!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blade of light opens in the air!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light tears loose and flies in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, you moron: you do that again, I'll carve you a new --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with the GOLD CYLINDERS.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
(fierce whisper, to WHITMAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!! We have to stop them!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy. Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the squad of Allies storms the area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and grabs a grenade from his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. The steel chops clean through their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the earth right next to MATLIN.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grigory!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal glove, empty and smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, nothing more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.
</DIRECTION>
<MATLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's almost over!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATLIN>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cordon off the area. Something came through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOM>
<WHITMAN>

</WHITMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.
</DIRECTION>
<MATLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe in hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATLIN>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --

	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes him more than a hundred --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATLIN>
<DIRECTION>
A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, accompanied by a loud scrape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --
</DIRECTION>
<MATLIN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone saint.

WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom stops him from firing.

<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait --

</BROOM>
<DIRECTION>
In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED THING shrinks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the chocolate.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! would'ya look at the size of that whammer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers snatch the candy. Broom smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<BROOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a boy. Just a baby boy.

TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in his hand.

Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.

Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes everything in an intimate, warm light.

One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to the tank.

Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are bubbling.

Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!

Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it grows still.

Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --

<DIRECTION>
WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.

Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's skin.

Hellboy manages to roll away.

KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.

Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles after it.

Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.

<DIRECTION>
A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.

Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick- or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.

Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.

Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR TREATERS scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as Myers follows --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major traffic jam.

He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.

The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He follows it, until it ends abruptly.

He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of glowing goop hits his hand.

Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.

Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re- knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A deep wound.

Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking THIRD RAIL a few feet away.

Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.

Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar.

An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. Kroenen stands next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's body. He cradles it like a precious stone.

INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness spectrally as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there. But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from the pool of shadows on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly ticking gears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a giant bone saw, slicing across the statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears and the top half falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and winds himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns at Kroenen.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! Don't move! Hands up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_1>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two TWIN BLADES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers the steel, deflecting the bullets which --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards. They fall silently to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last guard raises his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_6>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD_6>
<DIRECTION>
Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted by an unseen force!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible force. He starts floating in mid-air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding an imaginary doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, gaining strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guard's body in opposite directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. Grigory looks at Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready the welcome, my love --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Salt. Gathered from the tears of a thousand martyrs. Restraining the essence of Sammael, the hell hound, the seed of destruction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It roars!!!

A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music on picnic tables.

On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden surrounds the building.

Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.

DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line patients, distributing pills.

Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands circle her wrist.

Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.

INT. B.R.P.D. ARCHIVE / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of HELLBOY clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12, dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers works at a computer workstation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The Enquirer. The headline: "ARSON SUSPECT NOW WORKING FOR SECRET GOVERNMENT AGENCY" There's a photo of a woman, taken with a telephoto lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another clipping: young LIZ, 11, and a photo of a tenement building burned to the ground: TRAGIC EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A QUICKTIME interview pops up. LIZ, in her early twenties. A caption reads: ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD, PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots one at the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like the term "firestarter." I just don't. And "Pyrokinesis" sounds like psychosis or something. I dunno -- maybe that's right. Not being able to let go --

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the rooms on both sides of a long corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes of everyday life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, still asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the bed, extending his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Master is calling your name now, my girl. We are all part of his plan. You must return to the child... So, once again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His fingers start to glow.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...dream of fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.

<DIRECTION>
FLASH BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps, carrying a basket of apples.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Liz)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give Mummy a hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freak!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Liz turns to see them.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
(to his friend)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? She knows her name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Liz shies away from them.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home, you freak. We don't want you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale blue flame rings her entire arm.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
(sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not again, please, not again...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Firelight glints off the crucifix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy! Mommy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Mother sees...

<DIRECTION>
Mother screams, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help meee!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then the rest of the people are --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one figure left standing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz... a little girl, still crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH FORWARD TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on a panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low rumble shakes the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the VIBRATING glass window they see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT

The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window, showering glass into the streets below.

He opens the door to Hellboy´s den.

Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every time he goes at the round stumps.

Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR records her constantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_MARSH>

INT. BEAM TUNNEL AREA - BENJAMIN INSTITUTE - DAY

An explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted walls and steel columns.

Clay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them -- MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS.

Hellboy and Abe bring up the rear.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

INT. (SET/LOCATION BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw gums and taut skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles blindly on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.

A large oval room of rusting metal, with pipes spilling water through a large GRATE on the floor.

Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices synchronize.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go, Doctor. This should cover your tailfin -- On loan from the Vatican, a bone from Saint Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky.

INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans from the past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a hand mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? It's thicker. Isn't it? It's not that doll-hair thing --

Clay tries his radio. Static.

He pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.

INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent egg!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It lands --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to reach deeper, screaming in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY

The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND SAMMAEL.

INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens of old photos of children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He discovers the Sammael engraving.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>

Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service shaft...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and it's a long way down.

When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A subway platform. Full of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of turnstiles, uprooting them all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS from the fleeing public.

A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's stone hand emerges, triumphant.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chunk-face!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.

<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do better than that. Big monster like you.

</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit people!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds itself in the tile wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a wooden bench, breaking it in two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS abandoned on a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUND_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My kittens!! My kittens!!!

<DIRECTION>
Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking citizens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, blood dripping from his forehead and nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps the tongue with his stone hand --
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second date. No tongue!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
-- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are fine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems lost, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight for Sammael.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.

	</DIALOGUE>
</QUARRY>

Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. Useless: the things plow on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few seconds, a green light beeps, READY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of fire into the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men pause: silence!

Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.

<DIRECTION>
BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, breaking his spine.

	Forget it. This is practically a city. And it stinks, and it's muddy. We'll go back, check into a hotel, regroup after breakfast. We'll have to make a grid, go by quadrants. Maybe satellite photography.

He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.

EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone cover and then jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse lies in a miserable black suit.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Animam edere, animus corpus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment, nothing, and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixty feet further, comrades, and three rows in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly points, as if in confirmation.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say "hi" Ivan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the desiccated abomination on his back, walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE attop a pile of coffins.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be alright... as long as we don't separate --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and ramming Stone: he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz and Myers are on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(into his walkie-talkie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...

On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from Liz.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<HELLBOY>

	On a scale of one to ten: two. But --

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal structure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere, a massive clockwork is TICKING.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S SOMETHING BIG"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move. We --

</HELLBOY>
<MANNING>

<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Don't --

</HELLBOY>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in charge. We go back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the CORPSE with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and makes it into the hexagonal building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of rusty steel blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously proceed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back into the chamber --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kroenen is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Manning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. Manning moves along behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The record finishes playing. Silence --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate blocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, smashing its lenses.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed my father --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
BAMMM!!!! another hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls off.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give your soul to God, Your ass is mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's hand, but loses his backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
(panting, whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not that big a fall...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot, sparkling steel blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso. MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand over hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kroenen goes to cut the rope...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching the top)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no you don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm, slicing through his own ropy bicep.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like playing possum, you Nazi pinhead?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then try playing dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits a horrid scream as it crushes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels down.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up his Zippo.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You call that thing a cigar??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never, ever light a cigar that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to HELLBOY.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use a wooden match. It preserves the flavor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<DIRECTION>
He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNING>
<HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, he thinks that you and I... That's why he's mad at me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's not true, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you feel that way about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly hear Liz and Myers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find themselves calf-deep in brown water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out. It's slippery...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils constrict. A snarl...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
(into the radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big Red butt over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
The rocks below him start to crumble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two new ones. Liz sprints to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. They're FIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy is in trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her body.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
(at Myers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
Liz is desperate, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me --

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of my life I've run away from it... Now I want it to happen! Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
Liz slaps him.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know now: I love him. I've always loved him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
(weak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Liz...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, on her side, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd comedy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him with a hammer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT / FADE IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church- like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from Lapikov.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't bend.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures at the stone piece)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world.

<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are the key! The right hand of doom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(triumphant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you think it was made for? Open the locks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it!! Don't do it!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silence!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine it: An eden for you and her --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory turns to Hellboy.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reasonable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In exchange for her life then, open the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. Then she goes limp.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noooo! Noooo!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the eclipse.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the door and claim her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. It lands near Myers.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a winter's night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone turns black as obsidian.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's more intense, with ripples and haloes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. The ruby beam pierces the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: a burning glyph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his skin, but he manages to free one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He turns it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SKY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The final seal. Open it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers her full in the face. She staggers back and down.
</DIRECTION>
<MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hellboy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember who you are!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy catches it. It smokes in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the stumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grigory crumples in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can live with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers stands by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Child...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
(dying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what you've done --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift lazily.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've killed me -- an insignificant man... but you have brought forth a God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out of the wound, like intestines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the air.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape -- BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by the second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell will hold no surprises for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to Myers.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<MYERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MYERS>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How big can it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash onto HELLBOY´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, finally confronting --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding cogwheels and gears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the floor, rolling into the crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, he grabs the belts with his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They never work --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He wraps them around his stone arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's innards. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy organs. The creature starts to burn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light ripple over the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch -- It did hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest and whispers in her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat or two, then a moan.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the dark -- I heard your voice -- What -- did you say -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZ>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<HELLBOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"You, on the other side: let her go. Because for her, for her -- I'll die. I'll cross over."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And you'll be sorry I did."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELLBOY>
<DIRECTION>
Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated by the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
