EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SKIMMING along the top of the water. Moonlight on the surf. Racing toward the beach where large bonfires burn. TITLES AND TITLE SONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FLIES THROUGH FLAMES revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SANTA CARLA BOARDWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the place where it's all happening on warm summer nights. MUSIC and NOISE. Arcades. Thrill rides. A brightly-lit Ferris wheel turning against a jet black sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAROUSEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning merrily. Loud CALLIOPE MUSIC. Young kids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches. A tough group of "SURF NAZIS" also ride. "My Beach, My Wave" on their T-shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LOST BOYS enter the carousel house. Cool kids in dis- tinctive dress. Compelling; not threatening. They are DAVID, MARKO, PAUL, DWAYNE; David the obvious leader.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREG, the head Surf Nazi, sits in one of the carousel's benches with his arm around his girl, SHELLY. He thinks he's King of the Boardwalk.. And doesn't like it one bit when Shelly casts an appreciative glance toward David.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David smiles back at her. Not flirting, just being chi- valrous. Greg scowls and takes his anger out on Paul by tripping him as he goes by. An insult... a shove. David joins Paul. Surf Nazis join Greg. The Lost Boys close ranks. A major melee seems ready to erupt, when the ugly end of a nightstick is shoved against his Adam's apple. A three hundred pound security GUARD is at the other end. The ride suddenly ends. CALLIOPE MUSIC STOPS.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to stay off the boardwalk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
For an endless moment David's and the Guard's eyes lock in mortal combat. Neither one willing to give ground. Then David smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's pull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The Lost Boys begin to leave as the Guard turns to Greg and the Surf Nazis.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, off the boardwalk. And don't come back!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Greg and the Surf Nazis grumble and leave. There is bad blood between them and the Lost Boys, but both groups hate the Security Guard more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT (AERIAL SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRAVELS through the empty amusement park as the lights go off systematically. CAMERA CONTINUES past the rides to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LARGE, EMPTY PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Security Guard approaches his lone car carrying his lunch pail. Deadly quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAMPIRE POV SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zooming down on the Guard. A rush of air. High-pitched SCREECHING. WHISPERING VOICES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks up -- reacts for a split second -- and then he's gone -- pulled UPWARD OUT OF FRAME so fast, he's just a blur. Only his lunch box -- bouncing on the pavement -- remains behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOTS OF GROTESQUE CARNIVAL IMAGES ON THE BOARDWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clown faces bobbing. Dark images in the carousel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERTED BEACH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAVES LAP against the beach. Lonely and deserted. No one around for miles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is quiet and still, until... WHOOSH! THUD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUARD'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
falls from the sky and lands in the wet sand directly IN FRONT OF CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrible and bloodless. Sucked dry, like a deflated balloon. CAMERA PULLS UP, UP, UP until the coastline is visible to us. And NIGHT DISSOLVES INTO DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC COAST - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helicopter shots of the COASTLINE and HIGHWAY 17 approach- ing Santa Clara: ocean, agriculture, etc. CAMERA FINDS a beat up LAND ROVER pulling a U-HAUL TRAILER.

LUCY ANDERSON drives -- late thirties, sexy, warm, com- fortable with herself -- a bit of a free spirit. SAM, 11, a victim of too many afternoons in shopping malls watching Bratpack movies, sits next to her in his trendy duds, suffering the foreign coastline with his large Malamute dog NANOOK.
</DIRECTION>

GRANDPA, a rugged individualist wearing old denims, Indian moccasins, long grey braid down his back, is a lifeless form on the front porch. Lucy and sons approach.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stuffed animals of all kinds staring down at him: Squir- rels, birds, cats, etc.
</DIRECTION>

Also, boxes of eyes, pelts, hides, wooden animal forms. In other words, all the equipment and accouterments of a taxidermist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL

<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is how we used to do it. 'Pony Time.'

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH IN FRONT OF THE BOARDWALK- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Sam walk across the beach, around the burning bonfires. The beach is crowded. Greg and the Surf Nazis hang out. It is all very strange and exciting to Sam and Michael who make their way towards the lively boardwalk. Sam fusses with his "mussed" hair and trendy clothes.

They go up the stairs near the bandstand. A LOUD ROCK GROUP performs. The crows and action are exciting. Michael and Sam make their way through the young people.. Michael suddenly sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heart-stopping young beauty. Different from anyone in the crowd, listening to the music and even though she's with LADDIE, 14, a sweet-faced but sad boy, she seems alone. As the MUSIC BUILDS, she suddenly feels Michael's gaze and their eyes meet. She is a person looking for a friend. Michael smiles. Star wants to smile back, but she can't, and reaching for Laddie, disappears through the crowd. Michael grabs Sam and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA CARLA PIER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In view of the boardwalk, but quite a distance away. Lucy, in a soft summer skirt and blouse walks on the busy pier; restaurants, souvenir stores, boat rentals, etc. A "brain dead" ex-hippie is preaching; ranting and raving. Lucy falls in step for a moment with a TOURIST COUPLE who are smiling over the ex-hippie.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I dated that guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
The couple chuckle and disappears in the crowd as Lucy comes across a kiosk with dozens of local ads for apart- ments for rent, fishing boats, seminars, and many flyers with missing children. Being added to this is a xeroxed flyer with a picture of the heavyset Security Guard we saw killed. "MISSING" in large black type over his photo. This is being placed there by his WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy passes the sad woman and their eyes meet for a second. Lucy notices a "HELP WANTED" SIGN in a restau- rant window. As she goes to inspect it however, she suddenly becomes aware of a YOUNG BOY looking very lost in the middle of the summer crowd.

EXT. THE BOARDWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is on Star and Laddie's tail. He keeps pace with her, walking a safe distance behind. She becomes aware of him. She looks over her shoulder -- then suddenly stops.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BOARDWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael rounds the turn and stops short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star and Laddie are surrounded by the Lost Boys. Michael feels upstaged. The Lost Boys look his way -- but there is nothing threatening in their expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all have motorcycles. They climb on and GUN their engines. Star climbs on behind David, putting her arms around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They ROAR away. Michael is left standing alone. Star smiles as she disappears into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH IN FRONT OF BOARDWALK - EARLY MORNING

VARIOUS SHOTS

<DIRECTION>
Michael leans to "master" the art of Surfing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's very athletic and it doesn't take him too long to get the hang of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is disaster, however, and settles for watching Michael along with the huge Santa Carla Seals who seem- ingly applaud Michael. Suddenly he is wiped out, however, by Greg and the Surf Nazis who surf right past him.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>

	My beach, my wave, dude.

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Michael peels off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BOARDWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is purchasing a BLACK JACKET from the PUNK STORE on the boardwalk. He likes his reflection. It's the kind of jacket the Lost Boys would wear. CAMERA TRAVELS with him as he gets into his new attitude. He stops near an EAR PIERCING CONCESSION and actually considers it.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a rip-off.

Michael smiles awkwardly at Star's playfulness. For a moment they walk in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you're new around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of. We used to come here summers when I was kid. Now we're here on a permanent basis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She seems pleased by that news. Michael gives her a look. He can't believe his good fortune.

EXT. BOARDWALK PARKING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Michael and Star approach Michael's Honda, the Lost Boys arrive on their motorcycles. Laddie sits behind Paul. David is astride a THROBBING TRIUMPH. Michael looks uneasy; out-classed and out-numbered.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you going?

</DAVID>

David GUNS his engine, then lets it REV BACK DOWN.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LADDIE>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>

Silence. Nobody moves, but glances are exchanged all around.

<MICHAEL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We still going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAVID>

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.

	C'mon, Star. Climb on.

</DAVID>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Star?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives Michael an apologetic look, then climbs onto the motorcycle behind David.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know where Hudson's Bluff is? Overlooking the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David again GUNS his ENGINE and Michael gets his meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't beat a Triumph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to beat me, Michael.

	Just try to keep up.

EXT. BOARDWALK STEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycles BOUNCE down the steps and hit the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now they pick up speed as they spin out from the board- walk, spraying sand into the air and REVVING their ENGINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People on the beach turn to look as the motorcycles ROAR by, heading for a more deserted section of sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AERIAL VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of ALL FIVE MOTORBIKES weaving between the ROARING BONFIRES.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOTS - THE LOST BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their faces are alive with the excitement and the thrill of the ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cautious. Worried. Doing his best to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SHORELINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorcycles speed through the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They head for the pier at full speed. The thick wooden pilings present a hazardous obstacle course. Michael SKIDS and slows down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lost Boys do just the opposite. They increase their speed as they approach the pilings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BENEATH THE PIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and the others thread their way between the pilings at breakneck speed -- executing turns and avoiding col- lisions in a way that doesn't seem possible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
travels through the pilings, trying to keep up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUNE-FILLED BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An area of gently rolling sand dunes. A bonfire burns beside one of these dunes. We HEAR the THUNDEROUS RUMBLE of approaching motorcycles and one-by-one the Lost Boys sail off the edge of the dune -- fly through the flames of the bonfire -- and land upright on the beach below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is the last one to try this. He's determined not to chicken out. He speeds up the dune -- flies through the flames -- and hits the beach. He almost falls -- but immediately rights himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star looks back from her position behind David and gives him a smile. The Lost Boys also favor him with approving looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RAILROAD TRESTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and the Lost Boys -- silhouetted against the night sky -- speed across the trestle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL AND DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now travel side-by-side. Star's hair blows in the wind. She reaches out her hand toward Michael. Michael reaches out his. Their hands touch for a moment -- then David turns to Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting above the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	noise of the WIND and the MOTORS Now we race!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David smiles -- and speeds ahead. Michael takes off after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HUDSON'S BLUFF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's Triumph streaks across the flat surface of the bluff. Michael is not far behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bluff terminates in a shear five hundred-foot drop into the CRASHING SURF below. And it's coming up fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROARS toward the abyss, seemingly heedless of the peril that lies before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to show fear. It's as is he's going to shoot off the edge of the world. He brakes and spins out, nearly losing control of his bike, sliding toward the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRAKES! The tires lock and the TRIUMPH SKIDS to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON TRIUMPH'S FRONT TIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging slightly over the edge of the bluff. The PACIFIC OCEAN CRASHES POWERFULLY against the moon-lit rocks below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slides next to him, slightly over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE BLUFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other boys now arrive on their motorbikes. David calmly climbs off his bike. Michael explodes and punches him. The other boys fall silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star looks to Laddie. Michael prepares for David's retaliation, but David surprises everyone by smiling his irresistible smile at Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far you willing to go, Michael?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUFF FROM THE OCEAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful magic spot. David, Michael, Star and the others climb down old condemned wooden stairs, passing huge signs on old rusted pilings reading: "CONDEMNED," "UNSAFE," "UNLAWFUL TO GO PAST THIS POINT." The group presses on toward a LARGE OPENING IN THE ROCKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group enters and Michael can't believe his eyes.

A VICTORIAN HOTEL LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has seemingly dropped through a crack in the earth. It is tilted and broken, but nearly intact: Front desk, lobby mural; wrought-iron elevator, and more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shafts of moonlight shoot down from cracks in the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was the hottest resort in Santa Carla back about eighty years ago. Too bad they built it right on top of the San Adreas fault.

Grandpa reveals what's behind his back: A grotesque stuffed woodchuck. Raised up on its hind legs. Teeth exposed. Very ugly, indeed.
</DIRECTION>

Lucy and Sam hide their revulsion as Grandpa proudly places the monstrosity on the dresser.
</DIRECTION>

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy nods and exits the room. Grandpa follows her out. Sam is left alone to finish the comic. But he can't concentrate. The woodchuck seems to be staring at him. Finally, Sam leaps out of bed, grabs the woodchuck and puts him in the closet. SLAMMING the door tightly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Worms?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David tilts back his head and pours the contents of the carton into his mouth. The slimy bundle of worms slides slowly across his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks on with a sick expression. He grabs David's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're only noodles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David shows Michael the carton again. And sure enough, they are only noodles. Michael is baffled. The boys have a good, long laugh at his expense.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
The laughter dies down as a NEW SONG comes on the radio. It's apparently a favorite of the Lost Boys because the MUSIC is immediately TURNED UP LOUD and all thoughts of Michael seem to be forgotten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone begins to move to the music. Star encourages Michael to dance with her. He's feeling the effects of the joint he smoked and his balance is a little off. His head is spinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During all this, David has located a bottle of wine. He pours some into a paper cup and offers it to Michael. Michael is about to drink when Star holds his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't Michael. You don't have to. It's blood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
Michael examines the contents of the cup and smiles know- ingly. He's not falling for any more tricks.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good joke, blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael brings the cup to his lips and drinks. The Lost Boys watch him carefully. Wine drips from the corner of his mouth. But it looks more like blood than anything else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael lowers the cup. The room is spinning around him. Suddenly: SLOW-MOTION. DREAMY MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA TAKES OFF
</DIRECTION>

whirling up into the air so that our VIEW of the lobby is now from HIGH ABOVE.

A drop of blood appears on her finger. She reacts, restraining herself from tasting it. Quickly she wipes it off and inserts an earring in his ear. He looks more like the Lost Boys every minute. The ocean CRASHES against the rocks below them. The moon and stars are out.

Before she can say anything else he kisses her again. The kiss becomes more passionate -- more intense. SUDDENLY LONG DARK SHADOWS LOOM ACROSS THEM. They turn to see David, Dwayne, Paul, Marko and Laddie watching.

</STAR>
<LADDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it was them, Star. I'm sure of it. He was working in the yard -- hammering something. The yard was big with lots of grass. There was no boardwalk and no ocean. She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was there, too. And a dog -- but I don't know its name. I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog. They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing. And I was laughing, too.

Michael summons his courage and climbs down. David follows him.

ANGLE BENEATH THE TRESTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All five boys hanging on. The fog billowing up beneath them. Michael starts to look down. Then, a RUMBLING is heard in the distance. Michael notices the look of excitement in the eyes of the other boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PASSENGER TRAIN is approaching. It's WHISTLE BLOWS. The trestle begins to shake. A look of terror comes into Michael's expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The train THUNDERS across the trestle overhead, only a foot or two above them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR and the NOISE are tremendous. The heat. The smoke. The dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys grimace and hold on for dear life. Then, Michael reacts in horror as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
releases his grip and falls, disappearing into the fog below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then: Marko falls. Followed by Dwayne. Only David and Michael remain. David shouts over the DIN of the passing train.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go, Michael! Let go!

Michael can't believe what he's hearing. He's scared out of his wits.

David lets go with one hand, clings on with the other.

<DIRECTION>
David lets go. He drops from sight; vanishing into the fog below.

<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL

Sweat streaming down his face. The final car of the train passes overhead and the noise begins to fade. Then Michael hears: laughter from the fog below.

	Drop, Michael. Let go! It's safe! Come on! Don't be such a baby!

They WHISTLE and CAT CALL and do everything they can to goad him on. All the while invisible in the darkness below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael lets go. He drops into the fog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes widen with fright -- but -- for a moment he is buoyant -- suspended in mid-air -- floating!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then... he drops. With a WHOOSH. Like dead weight. The wind RUSHING around his ears. He loses consciousness.

Michael steps into the shower stall and turns on the water. He lets it beat against him. Suddenly, his ex- pression turns to one of pain. The water burns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for the handles, turns down the hot, turns up the cold. It still burns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the hot completely off. The cold water burns! He jumps from the shower in alarm.

</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything in here that might pass for after shave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Sam locates a bottle of Windex. Grandpa examines the bottle, squirts a little onto his hand and smells it. Then splashes it on.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Michael enters looking drawn and tired. He still wears his sunglasses. Grandpa is startled by his appearence but says nothing about it.

Headlight beams begin to shine in the kitchen windows, moving rapidly from one to the next.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Michael arrives in the living room he can hear LOUD MUMBLED WHISPERING. Headlights flash across the window curtains, accompanied by the unmistakeable ROAR of MOTORBIKE ENGINES -- as if they were going around the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WHISPERING grows LOUDER. It seems to be saying "Michael, Michael, Michael." He goes for the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't open it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR of the ENGINES CONTINUES from outside. He reaches for the doorknob.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Michael throws open the door, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. The front yard is empty. But a blast of cold air rushes into the house and a WEIRD ECHOING sound rever- berates across the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low ground fog is rolling in as well. Sam and Michael look bewildered.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weird.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Michael closes the door and locks it. His face is ashen.

Lucy pulls up to the restaurant in her Land Rover. Max pulls up immediately behind her in his sports car. He jumps out, hurries over to Lucy's car and opens the door for her with a galant flourish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM AND MICHAEL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is in the tub. Nanook is curled on the rug. A radio is BLASTING ROCK MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam lip synching to the music, uses soap and water to sculpt his hair into a variety of punkish styles. He's lost in the music, enjoying this activity immensely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael goes to the refrigerator for some milk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Michael abruptly buckles over in pain. He drops the milk carton to the floor, where it BURSTS OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens up, sees the mess he's made and goes to the pantry for a mop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PANTRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael finds the mop -- but is then hit by another wave of pain. He grabs his stomach and doubles over. As he lifts his head, this is what he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls of the pantry begin to breathe! Soup cans puff out and suck in. Preserves seem to come alive. The light bulb expands. The floor ripples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael's HEART begins to POUND. Blood surges through his veins -- causing them to bulge and ripple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MICHAEL'S MOUTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as his teeth begin to extend -- cutting his gums.

</MAX>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children. Work with kids in some way. Teenagers, maybe.

INT. STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael appears in the shadows. His veins have returned to normal, but he is possessed by a strange calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael begins to ascend the stairs. We hear the sound of his HEARTBEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael reaches the second floor landing and moves slowly down the hallway toward the bathroom door. His HEART POUNDS even LOUDER in his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Sam is in the tub. MUSIC blaring. Sculpting his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY

NONOOK raises his head and begins to WHINE.

<DIRECTION>
Sam, unaware of Nanook's nervous behavior, disappears under the water to rinse his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NONOOK sits up and HOWLS -- and Michael bursts in!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Nanook lock eyes. NANOOK begins to GROWL softly. A deep, primordial GROWL of warning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips peel back, revealing his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NANOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lunges at Michael, propelling both of them into the hallway. The DOOR SLAMS shut behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
surfaces for air, hears a tremendous FIGHT going on in the hallway. THUDDING, BANGING, GROWLING and HOWLING. Tumbling downstairs followed abruptly by silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY

<DIRECTION>
Sam steps cautiously into the hallway. It is dark.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael? Are you there, Nanook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
No response whatsoever. Sam swallows hard and begins to walk down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- he hears HEAVY BREATHING and stops in his tracks. He looks down the dark staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael?

<MICHAEL>

Sam turns on the light -- and SCREAMS!

is huddled at the bottom of staircase, his face and hands covered in blood.

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing! I didn't hurt him. He bit me! This is my blood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael shows Sam the gash across the palm of his hand. Sam reacts. Nanook appears protectively beside Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was protecting you!

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is shocked to hear this. But gets an even greater shock when he looks at the mirror in the hallway. He GASPS out loud.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What??
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

He makes a cross with his fingers and runs for his room.

INT. MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is happening, but we can't tell what. Yet we feel the distinct sensation of movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. Michael's nose makes contact with a hard white surface. It's as if something is pressing down on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and we realize that Michael is floating above his bed! Completely weightless. Gravity-free. The white surface is the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks scared and confused. He's out of control. Floating aimlessly near the ceiling like a helium balloon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wants desperately to get back down. He tries to maneuver himself toward his bed. He grabs hold of the blind cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the window is open and Michael's feet float out -- and the rest of him soon follows.

Michael is bobbing helplessly in the air outside the window. He's yelling something but we can't hear what it is. Then, Michael's foot CRASHES through the window and we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me! Sam -- help me! I'm your brother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is shaken back into reality by Michael's cry. He puts his fear aside and acts on instinct to save his brother. He rushes out of his room and into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where he is greeted by a chilling wind that blows in through the opened window. Sam almost has to fight his way toward the window, that's how strong the wind is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he gets there and begins to reel Michael back inside. As Michael climbs back inside, he immediately anchors himself to the bed with the blind cord.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>

She grabs a dish towel and begins to mop up the milk, placing the ruptured carton on the counter in the process.

SOME IMAGES WE HAVE NOT ALREADY SEEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Star together. She's on the back of his bike, her arms tightly-wrapped around his waist. They are speeding along a moon-lit beach -- or some equally romantic location. Michael is as happy as any young man has the right to be. SONG CONTINUES.

FLYING POV

Speeding across the ocean, heading for the cave. Much NOISE. WHISTLING wind. FLAPPING wings. WHISPERING. SONG CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY/CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is curled up on Star's bed. The NOISE sweeps into the cave on a cold rush of air. Michael stirs. He hears voices. Then looks up to see Star coming to lie next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Star. I have to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Star doesn't respond. She's fallen right to sleep. Michael tries to awaken her.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to talk to you. Please wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>

	When?

</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight. At the boardwalk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
She almost doesn't get the last word out before falling back to sleep. Michael gets to his feet and staggers away from Star's bed. He notices Laddie sleeping nearby. But there is no sign of the other Lost Boys. SONG ENDS.

EXT. GRANDPA'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Michael drives up on his Honda. He approaches the house. Lucy is on the porch, drinking coffee.

<LUCY>

	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael nods and keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, Michael? Aren't we friends anymore?

</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
He stops.

<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's act like friends. Let's talk. I know this is a new place, and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael begins to roll his eyes impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
(moving away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tired now.

</LUCY>
<MICHAEL>

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael heads into the house. Lucy tugs on her own ear- lobe to indicate Michael's earring.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't even gotten around to this yet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael walks into the house without saying another word. Lucy looks frustrated and concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is at the table eating breakfast and reading a vampire comic. Grandpa is pouring a cup of coffee. The two brothers exchange a look, but say nothing.

Michael doesn't reply. He glances down at the comic that Sam is reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - VAMPIRE COMIC BOOK

A very bloody drawing of a vampire being staked through the heart.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy checks the address she has written down.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Not bad, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy reaches for a wine bottle with a note attached as she gets out of the Rover.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An apology for running out on Max last night... Actually you should be making this apology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries the main gate, but finds it locked.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better leave this on the front porch or someone's just going to take it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs over a low portion of the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy approaches the house. She sees Thorn sleeping on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Thorn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, unexpectedly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THORN ATTACKS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaping to his feet -- charging from the porch -- GROWL - ING viciously -- ribbons of saliva trailing from his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns and charges back toward the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jumps from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
LUCY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drops the wine. It smashes on the sidewalk. She just makes it safely over the fence, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THORN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASHES into it -- bending the bars to conform to the contours of his head. Thorn reels back, stunned -- but finds his footing and begins to BARK at Sam and Lucy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes to his mother's side.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy has skinned her knees landing on the sidewalk. But she is more shaken than hurt -- and she feels very foolish.

They sit on the boardwalk steps.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something to tell you guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's dating one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is very probable. What's your reasoning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whips a comic from his back pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to this. From Vampires Everywhere...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a Guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell -- are often employed for this purpose.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Frogs are completely convinced.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you that comic would save your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Greg and the Surf Nazis appear and grab their comics. In a flash they tear them to shreds and sprinkle the pieces over their heads onto the sand. The Frogs and Sam are enraged as the Surf Nazis walk off laughing to themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.

</EDGAR>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know they're not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks at them like they've been putting him on.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, just because a Marine hasn't seen combat, doesn't mean he still isn't a Marine. Let's check out your mother's boy friend.

They leave as CAMERA FOCUSES on shreds of vampire comics in the sand.

Michael enters.

<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.

</LUCY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't. Got plans of my own.

	There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael. Things are going to change around here when school starts.

Michael heads for the front door. He opens it to find Max just preparing to ring the bell.

	Hey. How ya doin'? Michael, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Max... right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence as Max just stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the man of the house, Michael. I'm not coming in unless you invite me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Michael thinks this is rather strange, but shrugs it off.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in, come in. I'm inviting you.

</MICHAEL>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much.

<MICHAEL>

	See ya.

Michael takes special note of Max's sports car as he gets on his bike. He thinks it's pretty cool.

Max enters, surprising Lucy.

Lucy jumps.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?

</MAX>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.

</LUCY>
<MAX>

	Oh, right. I always gets those two confused.

</MAX>

He follows her into:

THE DINING ROOM

The table is set. Lucy sets down the bread. Max comes up behind her, puts his arms around her waist and nuz- zles her neck. She turns her face to his. Max is about to kiss her when:

	Mom...

Max and Lucy look to see Sam standing there with the Frogs beside him.

	Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.

<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...

She looks them over strangely but The Frogs and Sam only have eyes for Max.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is seated around the dinner table. Edgar and Alan concentrate on Max's behavior. Lucy serves spaghetti from a large plate.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This looks terrific, Lucy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy! Somebody areound here sure has bad breath!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
The boys all look directly at MAx. But Lucy means Nanook who is on her case.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere, Nanook.

The Frogs exchange disappointed expressions.

Sam indicates Max's large plate of spaghetti.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Sam. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max takes the container and sprinkles some of the grated cheese onto his spaghetti. Sam and the Frogs exchange a conspiratorial look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max takes a mouthful of spaghetti and nearly spits it out.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max! What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's garlic!! I like garlic, but...

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He sputters.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick -- drink some water!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam intentionally spills a glass of water onto Max's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Easy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps from his seat, tries to mop up the spill with his napkin.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it burn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing!

<LUCY>

Then, very casually, Edgar leans back in his chair and flips off the lights. The room goes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be a circuit breaker.

</SAM>

We hear SCUFFLING of FEET, CHAIRS MOVING, people BUMPING into each other in the dark.

</EDGAR>
<SAM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit the lights again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
And when the lights come back... Sam is holding a mirror to Max's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled at being confronted unexpectedly with his own reflection, Max YELLS. Sam and the Frogs all look into the mirror -- annoyed to see that Max is producing a reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Max gets up from the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

	I think I know what's going on here.

</MAX>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?!

</EDGAR>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I understand what you're thinking, Sam. But you're wrong.

</MAX>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.

Sam looks a little shame-faced. But not the Frogs. Lucy follows Max to the:

	I'm really sorry, Max.

	Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two.

</MAX>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand Sam. He's just not like this.

	He doesn't walk all over me.

EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is looking for Star, but he chances upon the Lost Boys instead. David has his back to him. Michael comes up behind him and spins David forcefully around.

<MICHAEL>

	Where is she?!

</MICHAEL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MICHAEL>
<DAVID>

	If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David gets on his bike. Michael is forced to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorbikes pull up and park. Everyone climbs off and begins to climb the high trees. David waits to be last. He gestures for Michael to climb.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this, David?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Michael hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never see Star again if you're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks at David for a beat, then begins to climb the tree. David follows him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA RISES OVER THE TREE TOPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to reveal Greg and the Surf Nazis camping in the distance. They have a fire going. They're drinking beer and smoking dope and laughing with their girlfriends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOST BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watch them from their vantage point high up in the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What happens next happens fast. It's confusing and dis- orienting. Much is suggested, but little is shown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lost Boys swoop out of the trees and attach the Surf Nazis. Mostly, we just HEAR the NOISE and see shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SURF NAZIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
react in horror and confusion. CAMERA FINDS Greg running into the water. David attacks viciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, dude. My beach, my wave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stay behind in the tree. He witnesses the attack, but doesn't join in. From the expression on his face, we know that it is a horrible spectacle to behold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his face away. He looks like he wants to puke. Sweat beads up on his forehead and the color drains from his face. His breathing becomes heavy and his heart begins to POUND POWERFULLY in his chest. The vampire in him takes over and as the Lost Boys shout his name, he feels compelled to join them, but he resists with all his strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed and frightened, he tries to escape down the tree. All the while the SOUND of the VAMPIRE MASSACRE continues in the distance. He slides gasping and sweating onto the forest floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, he just lies there looking bewildered. Then: SILENCE. The attack is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching FOOTSTEPS CRUSH leaves and SNAP twigs. Michael waits, unable to move. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOST BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerge from the shadows wearing eerie, satiated expres- sions, their eyes glowing dimly. They approach Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you know who we are, Michael... and who you are, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David's expression is calm and reassuring.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never grow old and you'll never die.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you must feed.

Michael glances in horror toward the direction of the Surf Nazi attack. David, Paul, Dwayne, and Marko walk off.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is dark. CAMERA IS CLOSE ON A PAIR OF BEADY EYES which now reflect the opening of the bedroom door and the entrance of a human form. It comes closer.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael..?

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turns on the light -- and we see that the "beady eyes" belong to one of Grandpa's mounted owls.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish he'd stop giving me these things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam opens the closet, we see about a half-dozen other mounted creatures on the shelves. He tosses in the owl.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know everything.

</MICHAEL>

Then: From outside the window --

Sam and Michael go to the window and look out. Star is standing in the yard, in the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?

</SAM>
<MICHAEL>

</MICHAEL>
<STAR>

</STAR>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns from the window, races out the door into the hallway. He is about to go down the stairs when:
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's one of them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns -- and sees Star standing in the bedroom doorway. She has obviously flown up and Sam is freaked.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where David took me tonight, Star? Do you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them!

</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I love you...

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's not too late for us...

</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...

</STAR>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I've felt it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.

</STAR>

Sam gulps as Michael kisses her. Star senses something and gets frightened.

<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

In a wink, Star is gone... out the window. We don't even see her leave. Michael and Sam lean out after her.

	Star.

Michael comes down the stairs looking weak and fragile. Dark glasses perched upon an ashen face.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy looks more like a zombie.

</EDGAR>

Alan reaches into his backpack and pulls out a sharpened stake.

<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I run him through?

</ALAN>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer. Have you taken any human victims yet?

<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not!

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael grabs Edgar by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>

Michael releases his grip. Edgar rubs his arm.

EXT. GRANDPA'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are far out in the fields as Grandpa puts in fence posts from the back of his pickup. He turns as he hears his prize Chevy SQUEEL BACKWARD OUT OF THE GARAGE. Sam leans out of the car yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandpa, okay if we borrow the car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can answer, the CAR SHOOTS OFF TOWARD TOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA CARLA STREET - MIDDLE OF TOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chevy pulls up to a stop sign -- then doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHEVY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is why: Michael has fallen asleep at the wheel, his chin touches his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car behind HONKS. Michael wakes up an continues driving. Edgar warns Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just so you know: If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.

EXT. CAVE/LOBBY ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chevy pulls up an parks. Everyone piles out. The Frogs wear knapsacks in which they carry flashlights and stakes.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
The Frogs charge ahead down the old stairs. Michael seems to stumble. Sam supports him.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam... if something happens to me. If I don't have the strength to go on, promise me you won't let them hurt Star.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Sam swallows hard -- overwhelmed by the possibility of such a responsibility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOBBY/CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar and Alan step into the lobby and look around with wide-eyed wonderment. A moment later, Michael and Sam come up behind them. Sam is also amazed by what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's got to be a sleeping chamber around here someplace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
As they search for the entrance to the sleep chamber, Michael goes to the spot where he knows Star will be in the far corner of the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael bends down to her. She looks like a sleeping angel. He shakes her gently.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Star. You're coming with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her eyes -- is surprised to see him, but hardly has the strength to show it.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, sees a long hooded cape draped on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to put this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save Laddie first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
Michael glances over to where Laddie is sleeping. Star's eyes beseech him. Michael gives in to her wishes. He begins to wrap Laddie (who doesn't awaken) in a blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan has found something and called Edgar and Sam over. He's pointing to an opening in the top of the grated elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel it? Feel the draft?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar shines a flashlight up there.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an opening, all right. Let's try it. Somebody give me a boost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael emerges from the cave with a bundled Laddie in his arms. The sun beats down. Laddie awakens. He looks around with uncomprehending eyes. Michael adjusts the blanket to keep the sun off Laddie's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael staggers up the old stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL WITHIN THE CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, Edgar and Alan have all entered the tunnel via the elevator and now make their way down its long, dark length.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLIES begins to BUZZ around. Sam tries to swat them away.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're on the right trail. Flies and the undead go together like ham and eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Alan pulls a can of bug spray from his backpack and sprays the air. Sam coughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael arrives at the Chevy with Laddie in his arms. He opens the back door and places Laddie on the seat. Laddie remains sound asleep as Michael makes certain that his face is covered and away from the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, turning away from the car, he heads back toward the cave. It is obvious that he is becoming extremely exhausted and rapidly losing strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar, Alan and Sam are frozen in place with mouths hanging open. We don't know why until the CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKELETONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of dead hotel guests, killed in the earthquake. They still wear their period clothes. One holds a suitcase. One wears the bellman's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
summon their courage and continue on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY/CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael returns for Star. He looks awful. Star reaches out and touches his hand. Michael wraps her in the hooded cape and lifts her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys reach the end of the tunnel where a large opening awaits them. A biting cold wind blows through the opening and flies BUZZ angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that smell!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vampires, my friend. Vampires.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
They step through the opening into a small cavernous area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PITCH BLACK AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sharp, jagged rock formations protrude up from the chamber floor. A network of webs and mossy vines hang from the ceiling. Somewhere in the distance is the HOLLOW SOUND OF DRIPPING WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pan their flashlights across the scene -- but find no one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael carries Star towards the car. He is weakening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His legs buckle and he sinks to his knees. Star's hood falls back revealing her face. Michael finds inspiration in her beauty and struggles to his feet, lurching toward the Chevy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PITCH BLACK HOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and the Frogs find nothing until they shoot their flashlight beams UPWARD. And what they see causes their hearts to skip a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOST BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hang upside down from the ceiling like great human bats. David is in front, with the others behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SAM, EDGAR AND ALAN
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought they'd be in coffins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<EDGAR>

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's stake 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
roll open. Yellow and glassy. His voice is from hell. The whole cave shakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all dead! YOU'RE DEAD MEAT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAM and run for their lives. They scramble down the rocky ledge. They cause such a commotion, that the other Lost Boys open their eyes one by one -- glowing red in the darkness of the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys run through the tunnel, past the hotel guest skeletons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOBBY/CAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dash across the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAVE

	Fine! Stay here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam hops in behind the wheel. The Frogs look back toward the cave, exchange a look, and decide to make an exception just this once. They leap in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHEVY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar gets in front next to Michael. Alan gets in back next to Star and Laddie. They find it very distasteful to be this close to vampires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turns the ignition and the car FIRES UP. Hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Burn rubber.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar STOMPS down hard on the gas pedal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HUDSON'S BLUFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chevy ROCKETS backwards toward the cliff. Sam stomps on the brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIRES SCREECH. The car comes to a skidding stop in a cloud of dust -- its back fender hanging precariously over the cliff.
</DIRECTION>

Sam gives Alan a look.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all we need! To be caught driving without a license... and in the possession of vampires!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Michael's head slumps against Edgar's shoulder. Edgar pushes him away -- and Michael awakens.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael! Get behind the wheel.

</SAM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta drive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
As the Chevy barrels down the highway, Sam and Edgar assist Michael into the driver's seat. There is some pretty dangerous climbing going on in the front seat -- and for a moment it appears that no one has actual control of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red light!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, Sam and Edgar look up to see the stoplight. The Chevy rushes toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brake, Michael! Brake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Michael -- acting very dopey -- finally hits the brake. But Sam must take control of the steering wheel because Michael's hands keep slipping off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POLICE CAR PULLS UP BESIDE THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops look over at the Chevy with a good deal of suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... excuse me... which way to the Punk Rock Festival? We're the opening act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The cops just smile and shake their heads in dismay. The light changes, and the cops speed off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the Chevy breathes a deep sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRANDPA'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>

All enter. Michael carries Star in his arms. Sam and the Frogs carry Laddie. As they approach the stairs, Nanook comes racing up to them, BARKING loudly.

Everyone freezes in place. Grandpa looks the over. They must certainly be the most curious group of people he's ever seen going up the staircase.

Michael goes to the window. It looks as if his strength is returning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls back the curtain and looks out. He has a commanding view of Santa Carla. The sun has just dropped below the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns to Laddie and Star who begin to stir from their resting place on the bed. Star and Michael exchange an anxious expression.

<MICHAEL>

</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I should warn you all: It's never pretty when a vampire buys it. No two bloodsuckers ever go out the same way. Some scream and yell. Some go quietly. Some explode. Some implode. But all will try to take you with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Sam exchange a look. Then, Nanook begins to BARK from outside.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam leans against the front door, totally out of breath. Everyone is relieved to have him back safely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DWAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLODES from out of the fireplace! Everyone SCREAMS. Dwayne flies across the room kicking Michael in the face. Michael goes down as Dwayne grabs Sam and lifts him into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star grabs Laddie and rushes him up the stairs to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan and Edgar swat baseball bats at Dwayne --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne, mid-air above them, still has Sam by the arm. But Sam uses his free hand to draw his water gun and spray Dwayne in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne falls and CRASHES into the stereo, turning it on. LOUD ROCK MUSIC begins to BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star hides Laddie under the bed. She notices that the bedroom window is not closed. She moves to close it when it EXPLODES in her face and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flies into the bedroom. Star SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys hear Star's scream. The Frogs rush up the stairs. Dwayne BELLOWS in protest -- and a beam of light shoots out from his mouth. Sam continues to squirt him in the face. The water burns his eyes, blinding him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enraged, Dwayne becomes a disgusting and hideous sight with flashing fangs and purple face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

The Frogs and Star collide in the hallway.

<DIRECTION>
Edgar takes Michael's bedroom himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICHAEL'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar cautiously enters the room -- water gun drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom door opens behind him and Paul quietly steps out. He looks as horrible and nasty as Dwayne. His face evil and rotting. His fingernails long and sharp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul bares his fangs. They are yellow and bloodstained. He is about to sink them into Edgar's neck when Edgar senses his presence and spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Paul lunges, but Edgar SQUIRTS him in the face with holy water. Paul YELLS and SCREAMS and flails his arms, but Edgar continues to SQUIRT and SQUIRT, driving Paul back into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne grabs Sam and is just about to gouge out his eyes when:
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duck, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Michael, recovered, releases an arrow. It WHOOSHES through the air and sinks into Dwayne's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne ROARS in horror and pain. So loud is his cry that windows SHATTER and light bulbs POP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as if illuminated from within, Dwayne's body begins to glow. It CRACKLES with electrical energy. HISSES and FIZZES. Then vanishes from sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar shooting holy water as Paul backs into bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan! Alan! I'm almost out of ammo!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Michael's bedrooms are connected by the bath- room. Alan hears Edgar's cry and enters the bathroom from Sam's side, coming up behind Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan sees the bathtub filled with holy water and has an idea. He gets down on his hands and knees behind Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar catches on and head-butts Paul, knocking him back- wards. Paul trips over Alan and falls into the tub with a SPLASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water burns! Paul SCREAM and kicks. The water turns to a frothy pink and yellow foam -- boiling up, spitting, and shooting into the air like a geyser. Alan and Edgar jump back. And in a moment... Paul is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoots through the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Sam are about to run upstairs when:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARKO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASHES up through the window in front of them, blocking their path. Michael and Sam leap back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Michael looks up -- just as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crashes through another window. Hovering in the air directly overhead; his back pressed against the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Michael react as David SWOOPS down on them -- fangs exposed; claws extended. The boys leap away, but David's claws rake across Michael's back, tearing his shirt and drawing blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marko SMASHES the living room lamps and the room goes dark. Marko and David -- glowing dimly -- soar around the room like bats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marko and David enjoy the superiority of the air, but Michael has had enough. Sensing his own ability to fly, he leaps into the air and speeds toward David.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks astonished... and Marko catches him off-guard. He scoops him up and flies him into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael's flying is not pretty. He tumbles awkwardly through the air. But his aim is good. He COLLIDES with David in mid-air. Michael ricochets across the room and David is propelled in a new direction as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them careen from wall to wall like racquet balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MICHAEL'S BEDROOM

</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
LADDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still hiding under the bed is listening to every word the Frogs utter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to transform upon hearing the Frogs' plan. His "human" eyes roll back into his head until his "vampire" eyes -- glowing red slits -- take their place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laddie opens his mouth and a beam of light shoots out. His fangs begin to descend... POPPING his braces off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar's and Alan's ankles dangle temptingly before him.

<DIRECTION>
The Frogs are about to exchange another self-congratu- latory high-five when... the mattress begins to erupt between them. It bulges and heaves and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LADDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIPS through it! Bedcovers are shredded and mattress stuffing and springs explode into the air. Laddie has transformed into the ugliest, meanest little vampire imaginable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan and Edgar SCREAM at the top of their lungs and leap away from the bed in terror. Laddie virtually pulls the mattress apart, climbs away and advances on the Frogs who cower in the corner like the scared children they are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star rushes in, sees what's happening, and steps between Laddie and the Frogs.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laddie... NO.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
The Frogs are amazed to see Star fearlessly put her arms around Laddie like a comforting mother and calm him down. And Laddie returns to normal before our astonished eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marko advances toward Sam. Nanook GROWLS. Sam throws anything he can get his hands on: Plates, toaster, cups, silverware, etc. They bounce harmlessly off of Marko's head and chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marko continues to advance. Sam grabs the kitchen fire extinguisher and SPRAYS FOAM into Marko's face. But it doesn't stop him. Marko's long, serpent's tongue slips out of his mouth and cleans the foam from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marko just keeps coming. He opens his mouth revealing a blinding beam of light and long, jagged fangs. He rushes toward Sam who grabs a round wooden napkin ring and JAMS it into Marko's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ring props Marko's mouth open and offers a convenient opening through which Sam begins to stuff entire garlic cloves. Marko's eyes blaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Michael continue their aerial dog-fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael looks like he's getting the worst of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David gets the edge on him. He comes up under Michael, grabs him by the waist and continues to fly upward until Michael's head BANGS against the ceiling, knocking him unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael drops to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Marko struggles to remove the napkin ring from his mouth, and Nanook bites his ankles -- Sam continues to stuff garlic down Marko's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Marko starts to swell up like a balloon. Get- ting bigger and bigger, until his face nearly disappears into a puffy, purple ball.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nanook! He's going to burst!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Nanook turn away as MARKO EXPLODES O.S. and gooey green slime is splattered over the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam barely has time to savor the thrill of victory before something grabs him by the back of the neck and yanks him into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's David. He flies out of the kitchen with Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP THE STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO MICHAEL'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he hurls Sam across the room. Star, Laddie, Edgar and Alan are there as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David points his index finger... and a ribbon of flame shoots out -- like a welder's torch. Everyone fearfully steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David "draws" a wreath of flame around the windows and the door... sealing everyone inside. But he exits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael regains consciousness in time to see David approaching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just you and me now, Michael. One on one. Fight to the finish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Michael gets slowly to his feet, never taking his eyes off David.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over, Michael. You're the only one left. They're all dead. Sam and Star, too. All dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Michael doesn't believe him -- but he looks worried. Then, David attacks. He leaps at Michael... and the fight is on!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael grabs a wooden hat rack and swings it like a bat. It connects with David's head, but David is unphased. Michael swings again and David catches the hat rack, yanks it from Michael's grasp and SNAPS it in two as if it were a twig. Michael charges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They tumble through the air, fighting fiercely. CRASHING from one room to the next.
</DIRECTION>

Michael and David SLAM each other into walls. Finally, David picks up Michael's chest and propels him back- wards, two feet off the ground, back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where David traps Michael against the wall, the barbell pressed against his neck.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give up, Michael! You're one of us. Don't you understand that? You're one of us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>

</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks at her. Star turns toward the burning door, contemplates going through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON STAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize that for her to go through the door she must allow a bit of the vampire in herself to surface. A subtle change comes over her... and she opens the burning door and walks through it without harm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, Edgar and Alan exchange a look, then put their ears to the floor again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David presses hard against the barbells. The weights sink into the wall and the bar itself begins to crush Michael's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<STAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
David turns to see Star standing behind him. She holds the pointed, broken hat rack in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David releases his grip on the barbells. They fall to the floor. So does Michael -- holding his throat and gasping for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't kill me, Star.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<STAR>
<DIRECTION>
(trembling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, David!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Star. Put it down. Put it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Star's resolve begins to crumble. We realize that she is incapable of killing David. He begins to approach her.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
David spins in Michael's direction. Somehow, Michael has summoned up a hidden reserve of strength. He holds the barbells in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the barbells through the air toward David who catches them instinctively. But their weight carries him backwards -- directly into the pointed end of the broken hat rack that Star holds.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhhhh!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The hat rack enters his back, pierces his heart, and exits through his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David SCREAMS and BELLOWS and pulls out the stake. Light pours from the hole in his body like a brilliant searchlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then David flies up and HITS the ceiling -- still HOWLING and YELLING and SPARKING like a Roman candle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then -- like a balloon losing its air -- he begins to deflate and ROCKET around the room on a wild, spinning flight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Star and Michael duck to avoid being hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David is heading toward the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

<DIRECTION>
Sam, Edgar and Alan have their ears presses to the floor when suddenly, David EXPLODES through the floor only inches away -- and keeps traveling upward, EXPLODING through the bedroom ceiling as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

David CRASHES through the roof of the house and disin- tegrates high in the night sky -- like a shooting star.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and the Frogs looks at the hole in the floor, then look at the hole in the ceiling... then see the wreath of flames around the door and windows blow out and die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They rush for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, Laddie and the Frogs come down the stairs to see Michael holding Star in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is silent. And slowly they realize that they have triumphed.

<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You destroyed David. His hold on you has been released.

	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I don't feel any differently.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Star)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Star shakes her head, no. They look at Laddie. He also shakes his head, no.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means we still haven't destroyed their leader.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA CARLA STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa's pickup rumbles down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights sweep across the front window.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks toward the door -- and Max and Lucy enter. They stop dead in their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohmygod...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? Is everybody all right?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Sam don't know what to say or where to begin. Then we notice that Max wears and expression of pure anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are my boys?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's David? Where are the others?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, Michael, the Frogs, Laddie and Star know what Max is talking about, and they react in horror. But Lucy is still in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max... what are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it! You are a vampire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vampire?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you passed the test!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edgar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know that!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. The invitation protects them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Sam glares at Edgar. As if to say, Thanks for nothing!
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you I was after all along, Lucy. To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max peels back his lips revealing his fangs. Lucy jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still want you, Lucy... I haven't changed my mind about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max advances toward Lucy. He is the meanest, nastiest, foulest, oldest vampire of them all. And all the evil and depravity that dwells within his soulless being now manifests itself in his ghastly appearence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves toward Lucy. Yellow eyes flashing. Fangs descending below his jaw. Skin rancid. Breath foul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael steps between Max and his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't invite you in this time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out, Mom! Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Max ROARS and everyone is knocked to the ground and held there by the sound. Everyone but Michael, that is. He alone is left standing to face Max.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa arrives home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max scoffs at Michael.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, boy. Come and save your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Max do battle. Michael is brave, but fool- ish. He doesn't have a chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding Michael by the ankle, Max spins him over his head. Michael hits against the walls and the bannister, SNAPPING off the rails one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Max releases him and Michael sails across the room and lands in a heap. Exhausted and defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINDOW - GRANDPA WATCHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max smiles to himself, reaches down and pulls Lucy to her feet. Prepares to sink his fangs into her neck. She struggles to get away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fight. It's so much better if you don't fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers his head to her neck. Lucy looks over his shoulder, sees something through the front window. With all her strength she pushes away from Max, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDPA'S TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASHES into the front of the house in reverse. The truck stops, but the fencing material in the truck's bed does not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several large fence posts CRASH through the picture window... slicing through Max's body like knives through butter!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max ROARS in protest and in pain. The force of the impaling propels him backwards into the fireplace where his body becomes a VORTEX, drawing into it all that surrounds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sounds like the RUSHING OF THE WIND as furniture, drapes, carpets, etc. are sucked into the space that was once occupied by Max's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy, Sam, Star, Laddie and the Frogs hold on to one another for dear life, lest they get sucked in as well. Michael, too weak to save himself, goes by -- but Star and the Frogs are able to grab hold of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nanook also finds himself being sucked in. But Sam grabs him by the tail and holds him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything else that isn't nailed down (and some things that are, like floorboards) disappear into the swirling vortex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa, from his truck, looks up at the chimney and sees the VAPORIZED CONTENTS of his house being spewed high into the night air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max's own head and limbs are consumed in the vacuum, and the vortex beings to subside. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is able to get to their feet now. Sam sees Max's driving cap on the floor. He picks it up and tosses it into the now dying vortex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael and Star trade joyful expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gone. I feel it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<STAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do I!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAR>
<DIRECTION>
They look at Laddie.
</DIRECTION>
<LADDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Michael hugs Star.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone accounted for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa enters from the front yard. He surveys the scene, then, stepping over the debris, heads into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and goes directly to the refrigerator. He pays no attention to the mess or the gooey green slime that coats the walls. He just opens the door and takes a diet Root Beer from the second shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He POPS the top, takes a long swallow and lowers the can.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one thing about livin' in Santa Carla I never could stomach...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the damn vampires.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LOBBY/CAVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is deserted. CAMERA PROWLS. Then, one by one, KIDS begin to arrive. At first we don't recognize them. But then we realize they are: The Runaways who Lucy gave food to... Maria from the Video Store... A couple of Surf Naxis... (and perhaps others.) They are here to take up where the Lost Boys left off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES PAST THEM, toward the old mural painted on the lobby wall. The mural depicts a typical day on the boardwalk in the year 1900.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MURAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And HOLDS TIGHT on one painted figure in particular: A man in a straw hat. He's grinning broadly... and he's most definitely Max.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END
