Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns to Po, holding it out.

<DIRECTION>
Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it, but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the noodle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll.
</DIRECTION>
<PO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lightning!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PO>
<DIRECTION>
Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the fireworks-filled sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie- vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<TAI_LUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The scroll has given him power.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOO0!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAI_LUNG>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting shockwave collapses the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating punch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the impact crater.
</DIRECTION>
<TAI_LUNG>

(CONT'D) (out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally... oh yes... the power of the Dragon Scroll... is mine!

</TAI_LUNG>

Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's NOTHING!!

Po stirs.

Po gets to his feet.

	There is no secret ingredient. It's just you.

Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
</DIRECTION>
<TAI_LUNG>

	RRRAAAH!

Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PO>
<DIRECTION>
Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what he just did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY! He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<TAI_LUNG>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... can't defeat me. You're just a big, fat panda!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAI_LUNG>
<DIRECTION>
SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<PO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda.

Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.

	Oh, you know this hold?

<TAI_LUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're bluffing. You're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that.

EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE

A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.

EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER

<DIRECTION>
Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
</DIRECTION>
<KG_SHAW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! The Dragon Warrior.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KG_SHAW>
<DIRECTION>
As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<PO_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my boy. That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son!

</PO_S_DAD>
<PO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PO>
<DIRECTION>
Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.

Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then more steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<PO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PO>
<DIRECTION>
Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIFU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Po! You're alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, darkly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or we're both dead.

</SHIFU>
<PO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung!

Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. It is as Oogway foretold -- You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace to this Valley. And to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you...

Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
</DIRECTION>
<PO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Master! No No No! Don't die, Shifu. Please...

	Oh. So, um, I should...stop talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PO>
<SHIFU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIFU>
<DIRECTION>
Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
</DIRECTION>
<PO>
