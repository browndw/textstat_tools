EXT. FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muffled by the wet green forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The very earth seems to tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RABBIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment the forest takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face might be attractive, under other conditions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard- issue field jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell are those Krauts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and tries to go over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BACK TIRES spin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his face. Assesses the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Jeep free. When --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around the corner of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to hear them but he watches their every move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their Karabiners rest slung across their backs.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
AGAINST THE TREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly focuses himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he shoulders his carbine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And so they buried Hector, breaker of horses."
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but does not aim it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself an easy target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get himself killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into the air and waves --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- when from behind him comes a voice.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eine maus findet den kase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young face. Point blank range.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only - Kelly doesn't fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He just lowers the pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The German smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill me Adolf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mien Prisoner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes him into the barn roughly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly doesn't struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you waiting for? Kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up. One of the Germans shines a flashlight in his face. Kelly squints.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on you pussies. Let's get this over with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain pen.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(German accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will write your mother. Tell her how you will die now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly takes the pen and examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Genuine Third Reich issue, no less. Nice work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer pokes the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will write. How you die alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother and I don't have that kind of relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(hisses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or shouldn't he - but sighs and begins writing. After a few lines, the Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an Infantryman.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough. Now you will beg for your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What don't you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<INFANTRYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts sheepishly in German accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The protocol says we should -
	</DIALOGUE>
</INFANTRYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker. He seems to be getting a bit hysterical.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am the fucking protocol.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beg!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
He and Kelly glare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beg - for - your - life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to be kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer grabs his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silence. Now I have a little fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly laughs. The officer slaps him. Kelly jerks away.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's against the rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(sneers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no rules in war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly "keep talking" while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Officer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never killed anyone before, have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shower in the blood of my victims --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No wonder you smell so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GI>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly.
</DIRECTION>
<GI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you look at the manners on this guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to German)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember to thank me when I kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GI>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really, not in the neck -
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
But the GI does anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<GI>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GI>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to give you a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GI>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. They'll get me eventually. If you can't get killed in a war, when can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Look on the bright side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GI>
<DIRECTION>
The GI holds out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bart. Bart Bowland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GI>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About his own age, but BART takes up more space.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.

	Wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but I have to interrupt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck? You gave me a powder burn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMAN_OFFICER>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should talk. You slapped me. I'm not your bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about?

</GERMAN_OFFICER>

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother?

The Officer grins.

<GERMAN_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inspired, wasn't it?

</INFANTRYMAN>

Bart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Might as well. There's only an hour left anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
The German Officer crosses his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMAN_OFFICER>

	Admit it. You were scared.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.

Kelly gets up from the chair and falls over. His legs are still tied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some other SOLDIERS, done for the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Willys yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup. Just got her. Three summers packing out at Shop Rite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels, building up dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My bad. Thanks though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About a hundred feet away Kelly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't resist.

Bart climbs in.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans, a few Scottish and North African irregulars. "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" plays on the jukebox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy, confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched over, like someone might try and steal his food.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.

	That's what you get for invading Wisconsin.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to hear that.

	Well, I got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop.

</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I would have gone to Langely myself only my polo pony had the fits.

Bart throws his napkin on his plate.

EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would, but then I might soil my croquet whites. You understand.

</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bourgeois. Cheerio then.

</BART>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed of. It is smaller and weirder. The flowers and bushes are overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning at precarious angles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly washes his Jeep in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. The Jeep looks good as new. He pulls a canvas cover over it.

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleep tight Hot Lips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly walks in on his dad ABE making sandwiches. A great big pile of cheese and PB&J.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant Keller! How was the war? Did we win?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly doesn't smile at this. He looks at the sandwiches and puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's downright angry.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me guess. Happy Meals for the wavy gravy wellness center?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A bit ill-used by life. The phrase "rode hard and put away wet" comes to mind.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back tightens. He slams the door with his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As usual, your cheerful optimism makes me ill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly. The hostility is nothing new.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should get that checked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>

	Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif Garrett for me.

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ERNSWILER GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases at long worktables. There's a MOTHER, father MAO, grandmother XIOU-XIOU, SON and DAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have on hats or clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes with a paintbrush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve wears jeans. She's one of those young-looking mothers Kelly's friends would have crushes on. If he had any friends.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO>

	A rough charge. You know.

(to Xiou-Xiou)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy - see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>

Eve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in French court dress. Kelly looks over his mom's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Grandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	She loves the gold. Always overuses it. And usually her touch is so light.

<XIOU_XIOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gold is the color of the sun.

Eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings in progress.

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why we never have anything to eat in this house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
But Eve has stopped behind Mao's painting. She's not paying attention to Kelly.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mao, what did we say about the eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe style, lots of pastels, very abstract.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mao looks at her quizzically.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More - empathy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. And didn't I tell you to put in more cacti?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<MAO>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no more cacti. Too busy. Simplicity is best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO>
<DIRECTION>
His family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement.
</DIRECTION>

	Oh boy. I'm not having this battle with you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly breaks in.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because your husband takes food from his own family to feed every loser druggie in Cleveland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve moves down the line.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you can always chip in here. We're ordering pizza later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
At this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased with the news.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Some people have to work later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(casual)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you drop something off at the dry cleaners for me tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve looks up at him for the first time. Takes in his filthy uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. Nothing's changed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the only thing I ever ask you for --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be dramatic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's important to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve stops at Mother Ling's painting.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mother Ling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - not that way - the sky should be stormier. Angry clouds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Mother Ling looks up at Kelly, who's scowling. She smiles and nods, understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I bother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly leaves. Eve's busy talking.

<EVE>

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Keller, who needs that sandwich more - you or the daughter of a crack addict trying to make a new life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about the son of a heroin addict trying to get ready for work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly leaves with the sandwich. Abe sighs and picks up more bread.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That went well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KELLY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the walls a poster for the Civil War miniseries next to one of Led Zeppelin. Some maps. A globe. Models of fighter planes and a set of old tin soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oh yeah, and his mom's ORIGINAL PAINTING, the one that started it all, this one signed by her - a very intense looking pink rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ah, the graveyard shift. Musak Steely Dan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly unpacks cat food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thousands and thousands of little cans of it. It's hard to keep the rows straight on the shelves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH, the night cashier, stands at her register. She's plain- looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures out who she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not another soul in the store. Sarah wanders over to Kelly's aisle as if pulled by a magnet.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how'd your battle go today? I still don't understand how you could reenact the Battle of the Bulge in seventy-two degree weather.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(plays with hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't all those guys freeze to death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly doesn't stop working. He's got a system.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a couple of guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's gross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	War is hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly grabs another handful of cans.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly pauses. He puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're never more alive then when facing simulated death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Maybe I should try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are William J. Stone of the 1st Airborne, pinned down in Noville. The Germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position heavily.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts throwing cans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're holed up in a stone barn. Sustaining heavy casualties. Running low on ammo. The cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, dodging cans.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters. If you withdraw, the Germans will flank the entire Allied forces arrayed along Bastogne and break the front. What do you do? What do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it!

Kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied.

	Sorry I asked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a peace offering.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole shipment in of busted Oreo's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept it.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DAIRY BACKROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back and forth and get philosophical.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The frozen food woman came in with her kids. They must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night. One of the kids looked like cardboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes for a cookie.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
An ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the backroom with her loaded shopping cart.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this store open? I've been waiting up front. If the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah gets up. Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a cookie.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a lot of coupons and I don't want to be here when they expire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charge her double for everything.

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah smiles and hurries away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK slung over one shoulder. Besides a serious case of bedhead, he looks normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE -- short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of each other's mouths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you looking at, GI Jane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No really, what makes you think you can look at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I honestly didn't know it was you. I thought it was a free preview of the Spice Channel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's pretty funny. You got dental insurance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly closes his locker and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bridget wipes her mouth guiltily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his pelvis against hers.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIDGET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIDGET>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>

</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are off in history class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The teacher MR. NORMAN shows slides on the Civil War. The more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks the remote and a photo of his WIFE, crouched over and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on screen.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries through to the next slide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't matter anyway. Everyone is almost asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more Mr. Norman talks.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks of Union soldiers fought bravely on. They were willing to give their lives so that others might be free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly shifts in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NORMAN>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
But Mr. Norman doesn't start talking again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly. Until the silence becomes uncomfortable. And Kelly gets mad.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second grade history class, sure - but to insist on still characterizing the Civil War as some moral struggle? The soldiers were drafted - the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldn't afford to pay their way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(losing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you talk about the Draft Riots? Where are your slides for that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the place cozy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLMSTEAD, a well- groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly doesn't move. He's not into this.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or question your teacher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I mean, who ever heard of a classroom dialog? Not Socrates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ms. Holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of herself. He's a smart cookie. She's got to change her strategy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans back in her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But you're making some serious mistakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need to. Everyone else makes them for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Her chair SQUEAKS as she leans forward and looks at Kelly intently.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This anger must be masking a lot of hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering what the tissues were for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Holmstead tries again. She looks down at his file.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you're not going to college next year. What are your plans?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly shrugs. Holmstead searches his face for any clues.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I get through to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Advertisers use status and sex to appeal to my demographic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. Her face clears. Something's clicked.
</DIRECTION>
<HOLMSTEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMSTEAD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
School's been out for a while. The first rush had already left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking lot to his Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You upset Bridget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly hardly stops walking.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to apologize.

</LANCE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do, make out with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Lance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you fucking with me? You little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just used fuck as a verb, noun, and adjective. Impressive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of him.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got in his knapsack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems unconcerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at it, gleeful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot and HONKS the horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rim job.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. ARMY NAVY STORE - DAY

</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for a backpack.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STOREROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bart and Kelly stand between shelves piled high with war memorabilia. Uniforms in vacu-pac sealed bags, weapons in shoeboxes, cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke-darkened flags.
</DIRECTION>

<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant's field flask.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget him.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, she must think you're really screwed up. Are you?

Bart opens the long box. Nestled inside is a leg bone with a foot attached to it.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>

	Stonewall Jackson's.

</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah right.

<BART>

</BART>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly nods. That is balls.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got so much crap crammed in here he doesn't even notice when it's missing. I saw a backpack in here somewhere.

	Oh yeah? Flea market, land of bargains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially if you know who to talk to.

Kelly looks at Bart with suspicion -- and respect.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of the school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro- Magnon FRIENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a WW II CAP, overseas airborne style, obviously Kelly's.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I just joined the Boy Scouts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you stay in it long enough, maybe you'll get your fudgepacker badge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Ooh. The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and EGG him on - "You gonna take that?"/"He just called you a fag", etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lance frowns and grabs Kelly.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a regular Howie Mandel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Still holding on to him with one arm, he SLAPS Kelly hard across the face with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIDGET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIDGET>
<DIRECTION>
Lance looks over at her and releases Kelly.
</DIRECTION>
<LANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay babe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day you and me will be alone. And won't that be nice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is hurt but covering.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad my mom won't let me date yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the dry inside of his mouth with his tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you mess with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. I should give him a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>

INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly watches TV in the living room. His cheek has a nice bruise on it. Eve enters.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need you to go to the art supply store for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks at the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get Abe to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at Care House.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make it up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where have I heard that before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are you going to give me a break?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly jabs at the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me think - maybe when I finally forget every single word of The Little Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in the car waiting for him to score. No, probably when I don't prepare myself before I go into the bathroom, expecting to find him passed out on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve waits through this.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, you know what? I know I'll be able to put it all behind me when I go away to college.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slaps his forehead, pretend remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only, I can't go because someone spent my college fund on Mexican Black Tar. So looks like I'll have to try to forget at Shop Rite, where I'll be working for the rest of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. You have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up. But please just get me some paints first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Eve comes over to Kelly. He sighs and puts his hand out.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you need?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him the money.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her hand up but he moves away from it.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. He looks up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's suddenly nervous. He knocks over a few cans of thinner. Almost leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite hers and waits to catch her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're having a sale on glitter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Tabby a second to recognize him.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hello. What happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tennis injury.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether to believe him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You paint?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you see... That's a difficult question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't really feel comfortable calling anything done since the Renaissance "painting." We might have a more experimental interaction with the picture plane, but our skills have suffered from it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this. This gives Kelly more confidence. He leans over the aisle to see what she's looking at.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're working with acrylic. Why? Oil's much - richer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you're not one of those oil snobs are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just - isn't acrylic a bit - jejune?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jejune? You're jejune. How old are you anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Older than my years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby walks to the counter with her brushes.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you paint?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks down and partially confesses.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know, my mother's kind of an artist, so -
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That explains it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. She walks out, Kelly with her, matches her pace, talking.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone believe in innate knowledge anymore? Michelangelo was fifteen when he painted the Infanta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo was Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby gets into her car. Kelly leans into her window.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. One world, one people. Just like Jesse Jackson envisioned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
She drives away. Kelly stands there watching. Then he winces.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell did you just say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>

Kelly pulls up in his Jeep. He turns off the engine but doesn't get out. Just sits there. He doesn't want to go in.

Colored plastic flags droop in the sun.

<DIRECTION>
MILITARY STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bart sweeps his eye over everything. A SKINNY GUY wearing a wife beater has some not half-bad stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass mason jar of what seems to be dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That there's actual sand from Iwo Jima.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY_GUY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or your sister's sandbox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
The guy shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it don't come with no certificate of authenticity.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(considers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could write one up for you, I suppose. Get it notarized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY_GUY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's quite all right. Actually, I'm in the market for medals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<SKINNY_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I got a couple purple hearts. A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them to you though. They were gramp's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wink)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bart acts casual, hands clasped behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have a lot of sentimental value -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<SKINNY_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy, who looks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY_GUY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Ulysses S. Grant's field flask, my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is shocked. The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
The skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again. He goes to get the backpack. Kelly's impressed by this smooth exchange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLEA MARKET - BETWEEN ROWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands. Kelly now holds the backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buying and selling US service medals is illegal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. That's why the resale value is so high.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what they teach you at Langely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so naïve. We all have our skeletons. Some of them just pay more than others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm not even going to ask about the flask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>

	Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets everything right, don't they?

A frowsy WOMAN in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of an extensive display of pins and buttons.

<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You boys look like Goldwater fans.

</WOMAN>
<KELLY>

	I've never been accused of that before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well jeez, you don't have to be insulted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything military?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
The woman considers this, her fan working back and forth lazily.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fish around in that cigar box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Bart paws through the box. Acts casual.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want for the box?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen.

</BART>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so hasty.

FLEA MARKET FOOD COURT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black & white face of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market food and watch a slow-motion bingo game.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goldwater fan. I think that's some kind of insult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going to go to school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, you have that luxury.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't have much say in the matter. Everything has been decided for me since birth. I'm not whining about it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy for you to say. You got a royal flush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? My life sucks. Everyone's always telling me what to do. You can't fight it. Go with the flow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
They eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the BINGO CALLER: TWENTY-ONE, THIRTEEN, FOUR, SEVENTY-EIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Tabby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got to go where she wanted. Sarah Lawrence. Six years. She's almost done with grad school. Yale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think people actually went to Yale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I mean, she drives off in her car in September. For all we know, she could just pull her car over in Albany and sleep there until May.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a joke. Joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
Bart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Is that what one of those sounds like? Somehow, I always imagined they would be funnier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for lesbians?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your face?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember the backpack incident?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one with mad cow-diseased hamburger meat for brains? That would be the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>

Interested, Bart leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to lower myself to his level.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. But there are alternatives…

</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alternatives?

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Bart opens a pad.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it limits our scope - what's the objective?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Humiliation. Rage. Despair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go- to war for that sort of thing. I have the declassified briefs from the Phoenix Project around here somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
Bart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby enters with an armful of art supplies.

<TABBY>

	Hey. I have some stretcher bars out in the car. Can somebody help me bring them in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course we'll drop what we're doing because what you're doing must be more important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>

Bart doesn't look up. He grabs another book.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I mean, I'll help.

Bart raises his eyebrow. Kelly shrugs off the look.

INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby drops the canvas and points at the table. Kelly dumps the bars and stands there looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the wood floors and skylights. Couch covered with a sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious objects stuck to them lay against the walls. They all seem faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly moves to the PAINTING on the easel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gold. The color of the sun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the Cleveland waterfront.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the viewer, I get to decide what it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't look a thing like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the light. I was playing with diffusion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well make sure you put it away when you're done with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>

Kelly resumes his tour of the room.

</TABBY>
<KELLY>

	She used to be. But then my dad - wasn't working anymore so she turned it into a business. She has a family of Chinese immigrants in the garage making them for her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Andy Warhol's Factory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>

</DIRECTION>
<BART>

He looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures "go." They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs towards the opposite side of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>

	We're the good guys. If you scream, the bad guys are going to come and burn down your house. Okay? So stay here and be quiet.

Kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door.

Bart turns up the driveway and RINGS the doorbell.

He puts his foot down like a kickstand.

She goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute, waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the same place.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should go --

<TABBY>

	Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set your canvas up. Use one of the ones in the corner.

	Well then.

Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies.
</DIRECTION>

He can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and she glows. She catches him looking.

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color out. Looks over his shoulder at her.

<DIRECTION>
He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being there, in the studio, alone with her. Trying to figure out how to play it.

Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake.

	So, what do we have here, a little painting class?

	Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? What's your real job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be stock boy at the Shop Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky says, every employee is part owner. So you could say I'm a captain-of- industry in training. Kind of capitalist larva.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's quite an image.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only if you see the most magical part. Do you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. First I'll have to be a pupa though. I figure I won't be going out much then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence of the insect world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Miner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making fun of, or if it might be him.
</DIRECTION>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever it takes to get you through the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls her to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the afternoon off. Come away with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not at a good stopping point.

	Oh, come on. They'll still be here.

<DIRECTION>
(to Kelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you'll still be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>

Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really shouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But everyone will be coming soon. And it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her and sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<MINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like tonight? We can practice honeymoon suite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINER>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves around to look at his canvas from different angles, like he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he always like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Overbearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby stops and puts down her brush.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because he didn't want to picture you as a pupa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he will - later. When he's alone. Whether he wants to or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly paints.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that though. How he wanted you to stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to be with me. What's so bad about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because some one wants to be with you doesn't mean they're good for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a hard time making eye contact with Tabby.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one should ever ask you to stop. If you stop, you might not be able to start again. Or you might start again, only things will be different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's sweet -
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not sweet, actually. It's just the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I can take care of myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>

She picks up her brush.

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's the wedding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the end of the month. But don't ask me about it. It makes me nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks at her seriously.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Is something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward silence.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you painting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, there are so many layers of - imagistic symbolism - that I really don't feel comfortable summing it up, but, well - it's a recurring dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby stops painting.
</DIRECTION>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle. She's riding it sidesaddle. She's got a fish tail, for chrissake. I haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, some people actually say what they really think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if they don't know what they really think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter. It's called being yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds boring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<TABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not boring. Scary and wonderful and exciting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TABBY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. His gestures slow down. He's taking this in. Then he shakes it off.

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop distracting me.

Charlie sorts his tiles and scowls. He leans in to Kelly's face, giving him the eye.

Charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from corners of the room. The canteen underhand. The Jeep cap as a free throw. This is the best day of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still crusted with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it. Damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>

Kelly tries to act casual.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I don't think that would be a problem.

He walks towards his Jeep and pauses.

Bart looks at Kelly. Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
The blood rises to Kelly's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he still won't look at Bart.
</DIRECTION>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. She's a Yale grad student. Talk about living in a fucking fantasy world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>

Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You'd rather have me be miserable like you are.

	Oh this is just perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve looks at the back of Kelly's head. She's tired but still trying to deal.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you say something like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kelly sits on the bed. Then he looks at the rabbit painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs it off the wall and SLAMS it backwards against the floor so he doesn't have to look at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's rifle and TEARS.

Then Mr. Norman comes out.

</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Kelly. What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks up at her. He's still got the cut eyebrow, which has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Let me see that.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink along with Band-Aids and goes to work.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>

<KELLY>

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve rises to her feet. He's just sent her over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is wrong with you? When are you going to stop blaming us, blaming him? I'm sick of you being angry. I want to be angry! They just took out half of your father's stomach -
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming and crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not tell me what's enough. You don't know about anything. All you do is fight fake battles, in the woods, on the playground. But this, right here, us - this is the real one, the only one worth anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops and breaks down.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>

</EVE>
<KELLY>

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Eve looks at her son. Her face looks older.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I made a mistake, if you felt left out, I'm sorry. But I can only deal with one thing at a time.

<DIRECTION>
The sun shines in through Kelly's window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's laying in bed awake - has been for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. He puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the tie's too short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the suit out of his closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jacket doesn't fit. The sleeves don't even go down to his wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he can hardly button the pants. He rips off the jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls everything out of his closet. Nothing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at his DRESS UNIFORM, hanging on the back of the closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head. No, he couldn't do that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sighs.

Bart walks down the street to meet him.

</BART>
<KELLY>

	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<BART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you know why. Just go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BART>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Town Car pulls up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tabby gets out in her wedding dress. Has there even been a more glorious woman? Will there ever be again?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her MAID OF HONOR leads her around to the side of the church.
</DIRECTION>

</XIOU_XIOU>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandma Ling. Can you fix this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
She examines it and takes out a wet sponge. She wipes it across the back of the canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<XIOU_XIOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mom made it for you. I can fix it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XIOU_XIOU>
<DIRECTION>
She works silently for a minute. Kelly watches her. She cuts a small piece of canvas to repair the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you come here to work on your own stuff? Don't waste your time on this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<XIOU_XIOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never waste time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XIOU_XIOU>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the painting over and gets out some paints to touch it up.
</DIRECTION>
<XIOU_XIOU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Everything can be mended.

</XIOU_XIOU>

</ABE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple times, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know the feeling. Come on in and watch some television. Don't worry, this one's bolted to the wall. As you can see, my reputation precedes me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly comes into the room and sits in a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>

Abe and Kelly look up at the television in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer me this: how come no one ever reenacts the Vietnam War?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<DIRECTION>
Both continue to look up at the television.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plus that, you'd have to have protesters and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<ABE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Folks dressed up like your mom and me. People reenacting fleeing to Canada, burning draft cards. I guess that would ruin the spirit of the thing, now wouldn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABE>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could make it work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>

</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks just like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced rage, the fights and the stubbornness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But finally, relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and puts her hand on Kelly's neck.
