EXT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow piled streets at Dutch Harbor, Alaska. A wind blows. The street is empty. A bundled figure moves through the street toward a low roofed lighted building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign outside the building reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"OFFICER'S CLUB, DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone has scribbled the words under the printing "No Penguins allowed".
</DIRECTION>

The figure stops in the doorway and looks at a long thermometer. It registers twenty-five below zero. The figure continues into the club.

INT. OFFICERS CLUB ROOM - MIDNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the social center for U.S.A. flying men roosting in the polar regions. The air base is near Dutch Harbor, Alaska -- a commuting hop from the Arctic Circle. It is early winter. The night in Dutch Harbor is long and dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room two of the six gaming tables are occupied. At one sits a four handed bridge game. At the other sit five men playing poker. RADIO MUSIC -- an American Service Broadcast -- is coming a bit feebly into the room. All is cozy and steam-heated in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the five poker players are three men who are to be active in our story. One is W.O. Vic MacAuliff. He is a tough, taciturn radio man. He has seen service everywhere, heard nearly all the languages and drunk nearly all the different brews of the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second is Captain Pat Henry, in his early thirties. Captain Henry has been a flyer since he shed his first stocking cap. He is a man of whimsey and temper and also mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third is Lieutenant Eddie Dykes, a tall, homely man under thirty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overcoats, boots, ear-lapped military hats of the aviators lie on an unused table nearby.

INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a large chamer in a separate building. Here are concentrated the instruments used by the various scientists in their astronomical, mineralogical and botanical experiments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a large flat-topped table in the room sits Dr. Arthur Carrington. He is a man of 43 with an alert, cheerful face. He is good looking, well built, soft spoken. His dominant characteristic is a smile that seems never to leave his lips. It is present always on his face like an extra feature. He is a genius of science and a man whose brain is focused like a microscope on the secrets of nature. But the intensity of his preoccupation with science is not to be heard in the easy tones of his voice. It will be seen in the things he does, in his point of view -- but never in his manner. Outwardly, he seems only a good looking man full of child- like enthusiasm for a task and with a soothing, amiable way for his fellow man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room with Dr. Carrington is a lean young man named William Stone, in charge of the camp's photographic work and equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Captain Henry stands silently in the doorway, his eyes moodily on his scientific rival. The doctor is studying the indicator dials of a complex instrument on the table. Bill Stone greets the arrivals.

	<DIALOGUE>
	November 1, 11:15 p.m. Sound detectors registered explosion due east. 11:18 p.m. magnetic dial revealed twelve point three deflection. Such deflection possible only if a disturbing force equivalent to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore had become part of the earth within fifty mile radius.

</HENRY>
<CARRINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(amiably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, very much. Except for our photographic plates. Our telescopic cameras were working last night. Here is the film taken between 11:12 and 11:15. Let Captain Henry see it, Bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
Stone switches on a light in a moviola box and runs a strip of film slowly through it. Captain Henry looks into the box.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will note the small dot low on the film. It is moving from west to east. At 11:14 the dot moves upward. At 11:15 it drops to the earth and vanishes. A meteor might move almost horizontally from west to east, but never upward. If the traveling object caused the explosion we picked up, it is in the ice 48 miles from here. The sound reached us four minutes after the object's disappearance. This gives us the approximate distance from here.

Captain Henry and Lieutenat Dykes are at the controls. The rest of the crew are in their accustomed places. A dog sled and a dog-team occupy the rear of the passenger cabin.

Flight Engineer Barnes is scanning the snowscape below. So are Photographer Stone and the scientists Olson, Chapman, Vorrhees, Laurenz and Redding. Skeely is also peering avidly out of the window. There is an air of tension to the silence.

Before anyone can move there is a muffled explosion. And a second flare starts under the ice. Gradually the glare builds up. The whole ice field becomes illuminated from beneath by an unbearable light. The onlookers are forced to turn their eyes away, all save Carrington, and Henry who continue to stare at it.

A chorus of exclamations and queries rise from the group.

EXT. POLAR CAMP. THE LIGHT IS ALMOST GONE

The C-54 appears in the lowering sky. It flies erratically in the increasing wind.

The plane makes a precarious landing on its skis, the rising gale buffeting, and almost overturning it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half dozen bundled Eskimos come out of the camp and move toward the plane.
</DIRECTION>

Barnes, Eddie and MacAuliff pile out. They help Nikki and the scientists alight. In the half dark, the passengers start across the wind-blasted snow toward the camp. They move with difficulty. Words are inaudible in the gale.

MacAuliff gestures the Eskimos toward the plane. They climb in. Captain Henry and Eddie bring out the dogs and a sled.

The block of ice, half covered by a tarpaulin, is dropped from the plane's door.

Working in the icy blasts now sweeping the dark, the men move the ice-block onto a sled. Others tie the plane down, tethering it to stakes pounded into the ice.

He goes to the ice-block, and pulls off the tarpaulin. The dim two-legged shape is blurringly visible inside the block.

</HENRY>
<EDDIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the group leaves through the inner door. We stay with Ken. He stands alone in the cellar, leaning against a barrel. He picks up a whiskey bottle and takes a swig. Then he approaches the block of ice. He stares into it for a moment and backs away. He removes his gun from its holster, and resumes his place leaning against the barrels, his eyes nervously on the ice-block.

	Can you imagine what's going to happen when this story hits the headlines! Everybody who owns a sled is going to start for the North Pole for a look at the man from Mars. Gentlemen, you'll be doing a bigger business than Coney Island in a week! What a shame, he's dead! An interview with a live Martian! That would have been something, eh? Look, Captain, you've got to let these boys get at that corpse as soon as possible. Our readers will be waiting for details. You're liable to give the whole nation a nervous breakdown.

INT. RADIO ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire communication equipment of the post is housed here. A step-ladder leads to a trap-door which in turn leads to a small observation tower above the radio room. Sitting at, the radio controls is Ezra Hendrix, the operator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group enters. Ezra is a stocky young man. He is full of excitement as he turns to the arrivals.

Eddie sits on a cot. Barnes is curled up on another cot. Henry is at a window, looking out.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fogarty?

</EDDIE>
<SKEELY>

	That's my name for our pretty boy from Mars. He has the same dubious relation to a human being as that pot-bellied clam in Dutch Harbor. Dog sleds, Captain, are our only solution.

<MACAULIFF>

INT. STOREROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A faint light from the underground hallway comes through a transom. Barnes enters. The electric blanket discarded by Ken lies on a nearby packing case. It is plugged into the electric light socket, hence no light in the room. Barnes snaps on his flashlight and gets a bottle of whiskey out of another case, opens it, and takes a long swig. He leans over and plugs his flying suit into the other half of the double- socket shared by the electric blanket's plug. He takes another drink and, sitting in the semi-dark, starts whistling "Ragtime Cowboy Joe."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he stops whistling and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(self-mocking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whistling in the dark, aren't you, Barnes?..
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the whiskey bottle again, then sits staring toward the ice-encased mummy.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, let's ses what you look like, sonny boy ---
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He switches on his flashlight, and centers its beam on the ice-block. As Ericson said, the ice is now almost transparent. Through it, only partially distorted, can be seen an unearthly horror. It has a bulbous head, a tiny suck-hole for a mouth, multiple eyes, no ears. Its arms are extra-long, ending in thorny clusters, rather than hands. It stares malevolently through the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barnes lets out a grunt of dismay, and turns the flashlight away.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks again, and then starts making himself comfortable. He uses a bag of flour for a pillow, and prepares to stretch out on the floor. Abruptly he shines the flashlight on the ice again.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit staring at me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the blanket lying on the nearby packing case. He picks it up, and throws it over the ice-cake.
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could go nuts looking at you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
He lies down, puts his head on the flour sack and taking a magazine from his pocket prepares to read. The camera moves to the electric blanket now covering the ice-cake, then follows the electric connection down to the indicator affixed to the cord. The indicator hand points to the "full on" position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, the camera moves back to the floor beneath the ice block. A slow dripping has commenced. The sounds of the rising storm outside obscure the pit-pat of the drops hitting the floor. A small puddle starts to form.

The camera pans across the wet floor, and discovers the puddle is close to Barnes' legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - BARNES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is having difficulty reading. His flashlight has started to wane. He snaps it on and off, experimentally. The battery is nearly dead. Barnes aims it at the printed page once more, then decides it is useless for the time being. He snaps it off, and stretches himself out more comfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A splinter of light from the hallway outside still illuminates the scene.

<DIRECTION>
The form of a sled dog appears. It stands poised at the top of the steps for an instant, pointing eagerly at the storeroom window. It is joined by three or four more sled dogs. They start to bark angrily, their snouts still aimed at the storeroom window. They run down the stairwell and press their muzzle against the storeroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR STOREROOM CLOSE SHOT OF BARNES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sleeping. The barking and eager whining of the dogs can now be heard over the storm noises outside. The CAMERA PANS down to Barnes' legs. The puddle has reached them, and, as we look, they stir slightly, causing a little splatter of water. Barnes abruptly sits up into the picture.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What the --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, a moving shadow falls across his face. He looks up quickly. An expression of pure terror appears on his face. He screams eerily, springs to his feet, and jerks out his revolver. He fires six times, then, still screaming, jumps for the storeroom door, the cord from his flying suit snapping out of the fixture and trailing behind him. He yanks open the door and runs into the corridor.

As Barnes appears, still yelling, doors have begun to pop open. Captain Henry, pyjama-clad, gun in hand, comes running out of his room and grabs Barnes.

The other inmates, in various stages of undress, tumble out into the hallway only minutes later. Barnes continues to shriek incoherently.

Henry curses under his breath and charges in pursuit. Locating Carrington with his flashlight, he brings him down with a flying tackle. Carrington struggles to escape Henry's grasp, but Henry succeeds in leading him back into the storeroom. The storm noises have made their exclamations inaudible.

EXT. STOREHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The army officers, leaning against the iron wind, grope their way toward the barking dogs. Their flashlights are almost useless in the snow flurries raised by the gale. They stop and confer for a second, their words carrying no further than the ear they are shouted into. Henry points with his flashlight, and the trio alters course accordingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a flashlight beam picks up some moving forms. All three flashlights center on the activity, but snow flurries continue to intervene. Dimly, a struggle can be discerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The officers move toward it. A sudden increase in the wind knocks them down. They continue toward the barking and struggling, crawling on their hands and knees.

MEDIUM SHOT OF DOG PACK FROM HENRY'S POINT OF VIEW

The dogs are tearing at a figure in their midst. A sheet of flying snow blots out the scene. When it reappears, the figure is gone.

Henry, MacAuliff, and Dykes crawl into the scene. Two dogs lie dead in the snow. A third is wounded so hideously that Dykes shoots it.

Henry signals his pals to pick up the dead dogs. They each take one.

	A carrot that can construct a ship beyond our terrestrial intelligence, of materials we have not yet created -- and guide it sixty million miles or more through space.

	But you don't think it has any feelings, eh?

	An intellectual carrot! The mind boggles!

</SKEELY>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It shouldn't. Imagine how strange it would have seemed in the pliocene age to forecast that worms, fish, and lizards that crawled over the earth were going to evolve -- into us. On the planet from which our visitor came, vegetable life underwent an evolution similar to that of our own animal life, which would explain the superiority of its brain. Its development was not handicapped by emotional or sexual factors.

<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Carrington, you're a man who's won the Nobel prize. You've received every kind of international kudos a scientist can attain. If you were for sale I could get a million bucks for you from any foreign government. I am not, therefor, I going to stick my neck out and say that you are stuffed absolutely clean full of wild blueberry muffins, but I promise you that my readers are going to think so.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CARRINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for long, Mr. Skeely. In fact, not even for a moment if they happen to know anything about the flora of their own planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean there are vegetables right here on earth that -- that can think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A certain kind of thinking, yes. Did you ever hear of the Telegraph Vine? Or the Acanthus Century Plant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not recently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Century plant catches mice, bats, squirrels -- any mammals small enough to evade its privacy. It lures them with a bait of sweet syrup then it closes like a fist and feeds on the corpse of its catch. It is only a plant but its brain can obviously outwit a species far above it in the scale of minds as we measure them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, doctor. And what's a Telegraph Vine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A vine that has proven beyond doubt that it can signal to other vines of its species twenty or one hundred miles away. If an insect migration, for instance, is moving in a certain direction, it will devour the first vine but the second one, having been warned, will have altered its chemical structure so that the insects find it inedible.

	It ran out into the cold. I think our surmise that it requires a cold temperature is correct.

<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a stranger in a strange land -- with strange -- unearthly features and attributes. The only crimes involved are those that man and nature have committed against it. It crashed in an air ship, was frozen in the ice, had its head split open by a pick, and was attacked by a pack of fierce dogs. I see no reason to give it a bad character, Captain.

<DIRECTION>
He is studying a thermometer removed from the arm as he dictates. There is a hush. The only sound is that made by the knife fingers beating on the table. During the hush, Carrington takes the surgical scalpel and cuts his thumb. He holds the bleeding thumb over the moving hand. His blood drops on the forearm. The hand's activity is increased. Its fingers move more quickly as they beat on the table top. Carrington continues his dictating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I believe the activity due to the fact that the organism when it's temperature rose was able to ingest the nourishment provided by the canine blood with which it was covered...

For answer Carrington strides to the rear door. Leaving the bolt still in "Shot" position, he turns the knob and pulls. The door opens.

Voorhees and Laurenz move quickly to the door. The wind whistles about them as the three scientists examine the bolt.

Its handle glistens strangely.

Carrington touches the handle with his forefinger. It is coated with a viscous fluid. Carrington rubs it between his thumb and forefinger, then smells it.

The bin crashes over on its side. A body topples out of it and crashes at their feat. It is the corpse of a dog.

	Two of our colleagues have died and a third is dying. Those are our losses -- and the battle has only begun. There will be more losses. The creature X is more powerful, more intelligent than us. We are infants beside him. He regards us as soft, vulnerable earth worms important only for his nourishment. He has the same attitude toward us as we have toward a field of cabbages.

The door opens and the post's radio man, Ezra Hendrix enters.

<HENDRIX>

	I got your message through, Dr. Carrington! And the answers are still coming. I had to take them in shorthand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fogarty to Henry. Carrington informs me Martian alive. You are directed to make every effort to keep it alive, and protect it against any injury. General MacLaren arriving tonight with fourteenth squadron -- and full government personnel including Secretary of State. Chief of staff already here. Under no circumstances take action against Martian until our arrival at post soon as weather permits. Confirm instantly.

(Hendrix looks up)

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one for you, Doctor. Fogarty to Carrington -- give Henry all cooperation needed to insure survival of creature you describe. Army and science chief regard your captive most important in human history.

<CARRINGTON>

	You have your orders, Captain Henry, and I have mine. I consider them sane and intelligent.

<EDDIE>

<HENRY>

He walks out.

INT. ROOM OCCUPIED BY HENRY AND HIS CREW. 1 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacAuliff and Barnes are sleeping on cots. Captain Henry is preparing to lie down. He goes to the window and looks out at the wildly whirling snow.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That stinkin' wind!

<DIRECTION>
(he turns toward one of the cots)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think our plane's still in one piece, Mac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
There is no answer from the sleeping MacAuliff. The door opens and Eddie comes in. He wears his flying suit. He carries a Kerosene hurricane light.

<EDDIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, am I bushed! That bitchy wind cuts you in half.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind filling this up? Burned dry. You'll need it outside. Blacker than Fogarty's heart.

talk)

Henry starts filling the lamp out of a large kerosene can.

<HENRY>

Henry has lighted the hurricane lamp.

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
A snore comes from Eddie and Captain Henry stops talking. He sits down on a cot to remove his shoes. There is a knock on the door. Henry goes to it and opens it. Nikki comes in. She is in a night robe and slippers. She carries a small toilet kit and a blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>

	Have you got room?

<HENRY>

	Come in. I was just going to bed.

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought I'd join you -- if you don't mind.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mind at all.

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>

He sits down beside her.

	You don't mind sleeping with one of the men.

	Mine either.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

the sleepers)

	I'll try not to disturb them.

<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can lie down, if you care to.

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared to death. The minute I lie down, I jump up.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I can relax you, baby.

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- no massages.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>

	Yes.

(holding her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're shaking.

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. It'll take my mind off -- what's making me shake -- that what- is-it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very sweet. Perfect skin, perfect nose -- everything perfect.

<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please go on.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mind isn't on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- it is. Honestly it is. You said I was perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you lie down you'll stop shaking, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You -- you can't make love to me if I'm lying down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I can. It doesn't interfere at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pat -- do you really love me? Or are you just talking because I asked you to?

<DIRECTION>
(Henry has turned his
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	head toward a clicking noise coming from the direction of MacAuliff's bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki frowns at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now whose mind isn't on it?

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling.

</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling nervously at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A room full of kibitzers and a monster floating around -- it's a little difficult kissing a girl under such conditions.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(his ears cocked at
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the continuing
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
clicking)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wonderful.

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
(after the kiss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very -- relaxing. I feel much better. I'll -- I'll lie down, it you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
She lies down on the cot. As she does, Henry stands up. She looks at him with some surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That clicking. Sounds like. No -- it couldn't be --

<DIRECTION>
(he smiles tensely at the recumbent Nikki)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>

(he goes to MacAuliff's
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	bed and shakes him
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mac, Mac -- wake up.

(MacAuliff opens his eyes)

<MACAULIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?

</MACAULIFF>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing toward the clicking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
MacAuliff listens for a second, then sits up swiftly.
</DIRECTION>
<MACAULIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The counter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought so!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
MacAuliff jumps up and grabs at a duffle bag that lies at the foot of his bed.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Geiger counter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should it be clicking now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something moving around that's radio active.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no -- no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
MacAuliff lifts the counter out of his duffle bag and stares at it. It continues to click, its rhythm accelerating slightly. Henry darts to the intercommunication panel at his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing a button)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ericson! Ken! This is Pat. Come in -- quick!

A moment's silence.

	Ericson here --

	<DIALOGUE>

<ERICSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a thing, Pat.

</ERICSON_S_VOICE>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's on duty outside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ERICSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Ambrose and what's his name, the carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON_S_VOICE>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beat it out there, as fast as you can. Check that rear door and call me back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ERICSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Henry turns to MacAuliff and Nikki who are staring fearfully at the counter. The clicking has continued to gain in volume and metre.
</DIRECTION>
<MACAULIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's getting stronger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Henry grabs a pillow from the bed and an ice axe from his desk. He runs to the door, opens it and cautiously peers down the hall. MacAuliff and Nikki watch him tensely.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Not a sign --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki gives a long sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My heart's pounding like a horse running away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<MACAULIFF>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking the counter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose this thing's gone nuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(dropping the pillow and ice axe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure hope so. Let me see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he takes the counter;
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the clicking is now
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
quite rapid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a movement outside the window. No one in the room sees it.
</DIRECTION>
<MACAULIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Dr. Carrington is experimenting some more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
(hopefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's possible. Shall I call him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
The intercom speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<ERICSON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's in order outside, Pat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON_S_VOICE>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(into intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Ken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps the intercom shut.
</DIRECTION>
<MACAULIFF>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes glued on the counter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call Carrington, Nikki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
(pressing a switch on the intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Carrington -- Dr. Carrington. This is Nikki, Arthur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
A moment's pause, then Carrington's sleepy voice comes from the intercom.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRINGTON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Nikki?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON_S_VOICE>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in Captain Henry's room. His Geiger counter is counting Geigers like mad. He wants to know if it might be picking up anything that you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<CARRINGTON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. What's the reading?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON_S_VOICE>
<MACAULIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight point six. And going up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<NIKKI>

(repeating into intercom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight point six. And going up.

</NIKKI>
<CARRINGTON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The intercom snaps off. Suddenly the Geiger counter starts purring like a rattlesnake.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(his voice rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie! Barnes! Get up!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dykes and Barnes sit up in alarm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab your guns -- axes are better -- Nikki, take this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he seizes the mattress
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	on his cot and pushes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
it at Nikki)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit in the corner -- hold that over you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to MacAuliff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your tommy-gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<MACAULIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACAULIFF>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls tommy-gun from under his bed and brandishes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DYKES_AND_BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up? Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYKES_AND_BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
A CRASH from the window is their answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pillows! Get those pillows in front of your faces!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
A second CRASH sends the entire window hurtling into the room. The Creature springs into their midst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNS ROAR. The Creature moves toward MacAuliff. His tommy- gun chatters at it point-blank. It strikes at the tommy-gun, knocking it out of MacAuliff's hands, and sending MacAuliff sprawling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature jumps after MacAuliff. It is balked for a moment by Henry who strikes it with his ice axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bullet hits the light. Only the dim light of the kerosene lamp remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature whips its knifed hand at Henry's face. Henry partially blocks the blow with his pillow which shreds in the air. Henry staggers back against the wall. He almost knocks over the hurricane lamp. He picks it up and dashes it at the Creature. Flaming kerosene spatters over it. As it stands burning torch-like in the middle of the room Barnes moves forward and strikes a mighty blow with his axe. The blow misses. Instantly the Creature wheels and seizes Barnes by the throat. Barnes screams once. His scream gurgles away. Dykes, holding his entire cot in front of him as a shield, rushes forward followed by Henry. They smash at the monster which, still holding Barnes with one tentacle, retreats to a corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the corner in which Nikki has been crouching. She screams. The Creature whips its free talon at her and secures her by the arm. Still afire, it starts dragging its two victims toward the window. Nikki's screams fill the room. Once more Henry charges forward with his ice axe and sinks its pointed end into the Creature's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature stops, drops Nikki and lashes at Henry. This time its arced knife-fingers slash Henry's wrist. Henry drops the axe and falls back. Dykes, still shielded by his cot, has at the same time grabbed Nikki's ankle and pulled her away. MacAuliff has picked up the can containing the remainder of the kerosene. He throws it on the Creature. The blaze surges up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parts of the room have caught fire. The Creature picks up Barnes and springs out the window into the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment its motion through the night is etched in fire. Then the wind and snow extinguish the flames. The Creature disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dykes moves quickly from Nikki to bend over Henry who is kneeling in silent agony, clutching his lacerated forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dykes snaps on a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DYKES>
<DIRECTION>
(panting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right, Pat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYKES>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(with difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he nods toward Nikki)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DYKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fainted. Her arms cut. I think she's all right, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYKES>
<MACAULIFF>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, she's all right.

	Barnes -- he died quick, I think.

(he points his

	<DIALOGUE>
	flashlight at the

floor)

	<DIALOGUE>
	That thing won't make much of a meal of the poor guy. Most of his blood's in here.

There is a knock on the door.

Dr. Carrington enters. Dykes' flashlight focuses on his face.

INTERIOR RADIO ROOM - 2:30 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the radio room is a short underground passage leading into the generator room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the members of the expedition, save Henry, MacAuliff and Hendrix are in the radio room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chapman is putting final touches on a bandage on Nikki's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two workers are nailing shut the trap door that leads to the observation tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry enters with Hendrix and MacAuliff following.
</DIRECTION>
<HENDRIX>
<DIRECTION>
(to Henry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...not during the storm, Captain. But soon's it blows over I can get the transmitter out of your plane and rig up a two-way communication with Dutch Harbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENDRIX>
<DIRECTION>
Henry nods. MacAuliff has taken two Geiger counters from a ruck-sack in the corner. He returns to Henry.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to MacAuliff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as MacAuliff shows him the counters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Dykes turns from where he has been supervising the workers at the trap door.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to station you and Mac at each end of the corridor. Take a counter along. If it starts clicking, report back here on the double.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DYKES>
<DIRECTION>
(feelingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYKES>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll put Nikki on the intercom. She'll keep checking with you, so we'll know if you get taken by surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DYKES>
<DIRECTION>
(wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be a big help...

</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Nikki)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got that, Nikki?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Where's the intercom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over there. Hendrix'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Nikki pulls a chair over to the intercom panel. Hendrix moves to show her the levers that will connect her with Dykes and MacAuliff. Skeely emerges from the generator room and crosses to Henry.
</DIRECTION>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Captain, what's the sense of everybody huddling in here? Let's set some acetylene torches and hand grenades and stuff and rush the greenhouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't in the greenhouse. I just checked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did it get out, Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burned its way out. There's a big hole in the wall. Still hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burned its way through an iron wall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's radio-active.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<CHAPMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(solemnly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably can generate enough heat to burn its way through anything.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Eddie? Over.

</MACAULIFF_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
At twenty second intervals, Nikki, Eddie and MacAuliff repeat the same ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still say we ought to corner that thing in the greenhouse. That's were it's growing its stuff -- it'll go back there --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<ERICSON>
<DIRECTION>
(growling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Corner it with what, you dumb joker? Insect powder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON>
<AMBROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(coming up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got enough cable to reach the nursery, Captain. Suppose we electrocute it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might be immune to electricity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<REDDING>
<DIRECTION>
(coming up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not. I tried it, on one of those horrible sprouts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDDING>
<DIRECTION>
Carrington has been sitting nearby, his head in his hands. He looks up angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You destroyed them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON>
<REDDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only one. It disintegrated under five hundred volts and burnt to an ash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDDING>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forbid you to do any more tampering! Our orders are clear. We are to wait --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(curtly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm giving the orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Carrington looks at Henry for a moment, then rises and goes into the generator room. Henry ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Redding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you've got something, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<AMBROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(eagerly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I run the cable into the greenhouse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our pal isn't going back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But those things in the greenhouse are growing... They must need -- nourishment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<REDDING>
<DIRECTION>
(to Henry: protesting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't anticipate its moves. Its mind is of a different nature than ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDDING>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mind at war is always the same -- whether it's hatched in Tokyo or Mars. We know the thing's objective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding at Ambrose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nourishment. Blood, and all the blood in the camp is in this room. He'll be coming down the pike any minute now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
As Henry speaks his eyes have been roving around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we'd be wiser to disperse --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd get us one at a time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing Henry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We give him a welcome home party.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points to the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	corridor that leads to the generator
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that tunnel. And a great, big hotfoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns to Redding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any chicken wire -- cattle fence wire -- any kind of wire webbing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<REDDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- rolls of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDDING>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ericson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ken, take two men and help Doctor Redding bring the wire out. Lay it in that passage way. Then string it along the roof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a fly trap!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ambrose, as Ken follows Redding out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splice your cable to the webbing. And fix up an operating switch on a long wire -- about thirty feet. How many volts can you give me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over a thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<AMBROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I earnestly hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBROSE>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got going, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Ambrose runs out. Nikki's exchanges with Dykes and MacAuliff have been continuing at regular intervals. Now Nikki turns to Hendrix.
</DIRECTION>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take over for me, please, Mr. Hendrix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
Hendrix sits at the intercom and starts checking with the sentinels as Nikki goes to Henry. She pulls at his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pat, don't you feel it? It's getting cold.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(paying no attention)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody who's not working get back in the generator room. Make it snappy, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pat, I tell you I'm getting cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>

	No, you dunce. It's cold. The heat must be off.

</NIKKI>
<HENRY>

</HENRY>
<CHAPMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at a wall thermometer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty-four. I thought it was getting chilly.

</CHAPMAN>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sure is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<CHAPMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(still staring at the thermometer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going down fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(placing his hand over a heat vent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no heat at all coming through the vents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got three furnaces. They couldn't all break down at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<SKEELY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	thermometer over

Chapman's shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going down. Forty-nine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone better go to the furnace room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Doctor. There's nothing wrong with the furnaces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be, Henry. Why aren't they working?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they've been turned off. By our visitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy Ike. He's gonna freeze us out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And come in after us when we're numb or dead with cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a practical joker. Reminds me of General Rommel when we were "it."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<CHAPMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading from the thermometer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's sixty below outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<DIRECTION>
Redding, Ericson and two other scientists have emerged from the storeroom with the wire rolls. They start to execute Henry's orders.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chapman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many flying suits are there, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight, counting yours. And one electric blanket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The telegraph instrument starts to chatter.
</DIRECTION>
<HENDRIX>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nikki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENDRIX>
<NIKKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIKKI>
<DIRECTION>
She replaces Hendrix at the intercom panel. Hendrix starts taking down the telegraph message.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chapman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me one for Nikki. Take the others in the generating room and tell the folks to take turns wearing 'em. Ten minute shifts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chapman moves to obey.
</DIRECTION>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our friend's quite a boy. Figures all the angles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(staring at the wiring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky thing we got Edison and Einstein on our side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<SKEELY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonder if they're going to be enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(equally quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering the exact same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ERICSON>
<DIRECTION>
(working)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My fingers are getting numb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON>
<SKEELY>
<DIRECTION>
(walking up and down to warm himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember once, in Accra, in equatorial Africa --

</SKEELY>
<ERICSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. Nobody's listening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERICSON>
<HENDRIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Message for you Captain.

</HENDRIX>
<HENRY>

	Hold it.

<DIRECTION>
(to Chapman who is
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	returning for another

<DIRECTION>
load of flying suits)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any rubber boots in that storeroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<CHAPMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plenty of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAPMAN>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get us four pairs, will you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chapman goes to the storeroom.
</DIRECTION>
<SKEELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're the boots for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKEELY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So nobody gets burned accidentally when I turn the juice on.

	All ready on this end!

Henry has moved to the door. He opens it. MacAuliff and Dykes come running in. Henry shuts and bolts the door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DYKES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The counter's going. The reading's low, but it's going up. Oh, boy, it's cold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYKES>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the counter to Henry. Chapman has come out of the storeroom with the boots. Skeely takes a pair, and the others are dumped at the entrance of the passage-way.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>

(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get those boots on, boys.

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to pull on a pair himself. Carrington comes out of the generator room. He looks at the cable hook-up Ambrose has made, then glances up quickly at the wire-web installed by Redding, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<REDDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That does it. All set, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDDING>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, everybody in the back room but Army personnel.

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Carrington strides up to Henry. His face is working emotionally. He is about to address Henry, when Hendrix speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<HENDRIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about your message, Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>

</HENRY>
<HENDRIX>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MacLaren to Henry. Use every means to save lives of expedition. But take no steps against captive. Expect to relieve you in three days. Hold out well as you can. Your main objective is to keep creature alive until our arrival. Congress, President, Chiefs of Staff, all superiors consider survival of captive creature greatest triumph for our civilization.

	Not at all.

</HENRY>
<CARRINGTON>

Henry finishes donning his boots. He stands up, and glances coolly at Carrington.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll discuss that some other time.

<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the rear door)

Carrington stands glaring at Henry. He makes an effort to control the fury in him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRINGTON>
<DIRECTION>

</CARRINGTON>
<HENRY>

	It's no fun breaking orders, Doctor. But my duty --

</HENRY>
<CARRINGTON>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your duty is to the Army you represent!

<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>

	My first duty as a man is to the human race. There's an enemy of it coming after us. I'm going to kill it.

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Redding enters from the corridor. He hands Henry a switch on the end of a long wire.
</DIRECTION>
<REDDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your operating switch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDDING>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Redding glances curiously at Carrington and returns toward the rear room. Dykes is standing by the intercom panel. He pushes a button. A subdued squealing comes out of the communicator.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?

</HENRY>
<DYKES>

<CARRINGTON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing more than breaking Army orders, Captain! You're robbing the human mind!

</CARRINGTON>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can testify to that effect at my court martial, Doctor.

</HENRY>
<CARRINGTON>
<DIRECTION>
(tensely -- and

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A secret has come to us, greater than any secret ever revealed to science. It must not be destroyed! It must be studied -- and learned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRINGTON>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw it, Carrington. It's not something to put under glass -- and examine. And there are thousands more of them hatching. They'll reproduce like weeds. They'll tear the world apart.

</HENRY>
<CARRINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't matter!

At this moment there comes the sound of a scuffling from the generator room. A figure bursts out into the tunnel, as we here a chorus of "Grab him," "Shut the door," "Hold him -- he's crazy," etc. The figure is Carrington. He pushes by Henry, Dykes and the rest of the Army group, and runs the length of the corridor. He comes to a halt at the far end of the corridor, facing the Creature. Carrington, only a few feet away from the unearthly visitor, extends his arms in a pleading gesture.

The Creature has paused before Carrington's tirade as if studying him. Now, without haste, it lifts one arm, and flicks its hand at Carrington's throat. Carrington falls to the floor almost decapitated, his last words still gurgling in his throat. The Creature steps over Carrington's corpse and enters the tunnel. It advances five or six steps.

He presses the switch in his hand. A bombardment of huge sparks leaps from ceiling to floor. The Creature is caught in the lightning flashes. It stands motionless as the thousand volt bolts crack through it from head to foot. In front of it stand the five men -- axes ready, and weirdly visible in the spitting light.
