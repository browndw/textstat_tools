ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the board. Walsh pulls it out.

It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop Five. Smiles. Looks at...

	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain's feet have moved off. Where? She listens, hears nothing. Slips off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - ERIN takes refuge in the service area, crouching behind stacks of TIRES. Knife at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain's FOOTSTEPS audible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER OBSTRUCTED POV between stacks of tires, the Captain, Glock at ready, PASSES BY, moving out of sight. Footsteps RECEDING. Then silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERIN Listening, neurons firing. Cranes her neck to see. Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls, Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>

	You don't know me at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the gun, aiming just enough off that...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a bloody mess. He starts advancing again toward her and Erin pulls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast. NOTHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME the Captain takes the gun from her. Shows her the CLIP he's carrying in his hand. Slams it into the gun.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
THE CROW flies UP toward the small entry window. Alex follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself up toward the windowledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERRRKKK. The SOUND of a car in a hurry audible as Alex hauls himself out the small window. Runs to the edge, spotting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAR BELOW a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around the corner of the police station now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain nervous at the wheel. He looks over his shoulder...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - MYSTERY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the carnage.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in sight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS MOVING POV partially obstructed, of the sedan below. Speeding around another corner now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a PARAPET where he totters over the vertical face as the sedan turning onto the street below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SERGEANT AND CREW emerge on the roof. Acquire target Alex Corvis.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop or...! Don't jump!

<DIRECTION>
The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city. WAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAM! ERRRK! The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely keeping control.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin perks up in the back seat. Battered. Ever hopeful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREETS #6 - DARK SEDAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE. As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we see a HUMAN FIGURE standing on top of it, legs spread, arms upstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward, right THROUGH the glass moonroof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! IN THE SEDAN the Captain horrified as Alex's hand yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the moonroof...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ZIGZAG PATTERN, THE MORTIFIED FLESH held in Alex's hand like the trophy it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARRISON'S PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex's voice appears. Calm. Unhurried.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Jolt, eight amps at two to three thousand volts. It lasts a few seconds. The current surges and is turned off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
FIND ALEX'S FACE in the darkness. Moving as he performs some unseen task. Intent, focussed.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX_S_VOICE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	They wait for the body to cool, then check to see if the heart is still beating.

</ALEX_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
FIND ERIN, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice.
</DIRECTION>

She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where the wounds are already healing.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it is... ba-boom, ba-boom... another jolt is applied.

<DIRECTION>
SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Experts say unconsciousness occcurs before pain has time to register. They agree electrocution does not "hurt," could not hurt. But it does. Unimaginably. Believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside. Alex looks at the phone on the wall. Silent.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't expect a call from the Governor. Any last words? Captain, my Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that it? Well, ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
A Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. The Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do this to me you little fucks! I'll come back, just like you, a big fucking shit spewing bird and three guesses what little bitch I'm taking out first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE. The switch thrown. ZZZZZTTT. PAN UP off the switch to...
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are so dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair, starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with him at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into seething detail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow and the first rays of morning light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over his.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to get some breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I mean is... I don't know how this works, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, face to face now.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Erin. I'll always be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
For a split second, she's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off, it's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go. Then she spots something...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors. "Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims." ERIN picks up the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex. Look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it together as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls, with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which is alot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the sign, and starts to CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that moment when Alex went... wherever he went... when he made that choice, I knew I was making a choice too. To be alive. In the world. And it made me cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FINDS Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm mercifully away from us. The CROW alights nearby, something in its beak.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the world is a bad place but the Captain gone has to be some improvement. And that hope, that tomorrow will be better, is enough to keep me going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by Walsh's head. CAMERA keeps MOVING, FINDING..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed and mute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing the words we are hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I think of Lauren fighting and dying, it tears me apart, but it also reassures me. That Lauren and Alex were meant for each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically transformed wild child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That they're together now. Fighters. United by love. And anger. That they've given also to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She's leaning up against a new headstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."
</DIRECTION>
<ERIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love Alex. As my sister always hoped I would. And I love Lauren. And I know, because of this, that love does not die. I'm alive. Thinking of them. Hoping that, sometimes, they're thinking of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIN>
<DIRECTION>
Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone, like the one already over Lauren's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
