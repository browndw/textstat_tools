	Hey, come on, if you... Listen, I'm never gonna be forgiven for that. Never! You know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. Everything had to be pitched. Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. Christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right.

	Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's wrong. Look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels.

	Say. After going to a new high, it falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies on good volume. I shoot an order to buy 4000 at the market. If I get the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know something's wrong. But suppose the order to buy the 4000 shares I put in at the price of 113 3/4, I get 2000 at 114, 500 at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way up, so the last 500 shares I pay 115 1/2, then I know I'm right.I'm going to peel off here.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BERGER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an "A" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems.

<DR_BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you still feel responsible?

</DR_BERGER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BERGER>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh...

He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it?

	Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not what you've done, it's what you think I've done. You blame me for the whole thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I can't! And neither can you, and neither can anybody else! Only maybe I'm just a little more honest about it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what he expects from me. I never have known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll tell you what he expects!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can't do it! I cannot respond when someone says: "Here, I just did this great thing. Love me.". I can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hate him? My God! How could I hate him? Mothers don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you?

	You are beautiful. And you are unpredictable. But you're so cautious. You're determined, Beth. But you know something? You're not strong. And I don't know if you're really giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about.

Calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just sad.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. But you can't handle mess. You need everything neat and ...easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't love anybody. It was so much Buck. And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I don't understand that. I just don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it wasn't even Buck. Maybe it was just you. Maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried. But whatever it was, I don't know who you are. I don't know what we've been playing at. So I was crying.
