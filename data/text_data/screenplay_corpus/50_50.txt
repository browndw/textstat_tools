EXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches, golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS STOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have an appointment.

</ADAM>
<RECEPTIONIST>

	Name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam Schwartz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. He coughs again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (CONFUSED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, should I go sit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time, Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam Schwartz.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else there. Again the receptionist calls out again -
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>

</ADAM>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I need to take off all my clothes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE_JOANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_JOANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<NURSE_JOANNE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cotton. You're funny.

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to fill this entire cup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JOANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. Can I take it home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JOANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(LAUGHS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it home. You're so funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS to reveal a group of MEDICAL STUDENTS taking diligent notes in the background. WE PAN AGAIN this time to the next room:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam struggles to fill the cup. After a few beats, there's a knock on the door.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOANNE

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just another minute.

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL. X-RAY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam stands in front of an X-Ray machine. The APATHETIC TECHNICIAN has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the air, then the other, and so on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joanne pulls out a giant needle.
</DIRECTION>
<JOANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here comes the choo-choo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOANNE>
<DIRECTION>
In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam is lying on the gurney of an MRI machine. He is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
</DIRECTION>
<TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(AUTHORITATIVELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now make sure you lie completely still. Otherwise we'll have to do it all over again. Which we're not going to have to do, right?

INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM - LATER

Adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Is anybody out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.

EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets to night, then rises to morning...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: JUNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About a mile inland, we come upon:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAND VIEW GATED COMMUNITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is Southern California Suburbia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and louder as we PUSH IN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic Achievement Award in the Sciences.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up. Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks around in confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(asleep and incoherent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't turn off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (WHISPERS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the bed, collects himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair. Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair. She holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god.

</RACHEL>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<RACHEL>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Don't touch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel rolls back to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It is in fact a gray hair. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large assortment of shower products, finds one that smells pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair. He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is well put together, but not what you would expect of someone his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's put the Christ back in Christmas."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave to Adam.
</DIRECTION>

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in line waiting for their morning coffee. Adam and Seth stand at the end of that line watching the YOUNG COUPLE in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you talking about? I don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. You're using her shampoo. Next thing you'll be using her tampons.

</SETH>
<DIRECTION>
Seth laughs at his own joke.
</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But seriously, let me get this straight - she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that big a deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So when does it become a big deal? Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My cut off...4 days. That's when I begin to worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SETH>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they're not Rachel. I don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. And I'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam...You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population.

Adam and Seth step up to the counter. They're greeted by the SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much.

Adam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices.

	Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again.

	DR. ROSS Well Adam it's actually quite fascinating. Your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 Gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. In your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower spine.

Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.

The office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about.

You mean you repress as a coping mechanism.

Is that what I do?
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
That's what you just said.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way. When you say it, it's like an indictment. The word "repress" - sounds so harsh.
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
It's actually quite common.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm anything but an emotional sheep.
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Don't think of it in those terms. It's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part. What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
So how do we do that?
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
The first thing I want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden. Cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance. This is your chance to correct that.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
You're not in a cult are you?
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now, why do you say that?
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
I don't know, it was a bad joke.

Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless patients. He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years. Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots A BALD WOMAN sitting quietly knitting. She's at peace with herself. Her Zen like state helps Adam relax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices HENRY (50), a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator. Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall. Adam looks on in terror. The genial MITCH(85) notices.

<DIRECTION>
Adam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin.

<LAUGHTER_THERAPIST>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adam and Seth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter. Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life.

Katie stares at Adam in shock.

	The garden with all the endangered plants?

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam is cleaning her car.
</DIRECTION>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, no, not that, that's my dinner.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until he had his stroke.

</ADAM>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
This is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest.

Katie feels for Adam.

The two continue to play. Adam wildly pushes every button as Katie's character pins Adam's character and repeatedly slams his head into the ground.

	I try not to look at the world like that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's infuriating right?

</ADAM>
<KATIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't say infuriating. It's just not good work place etiquette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATIE>
<DIRECTION>
Adam is far more excited by this revelation. He hands Katie a shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful smelling drink. He raises his glass to make a toast.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To complaining.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>

Adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste. Katie follows, and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over Adam's face.

For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look.

Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed. She slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then seductively kisses his neck. Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel and the two begin to go through the motions. Clothes come off. Adam gets on top of Rachel...And then stops.

Looking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his hollow cheeks and worn eyes. He looks awful, like an old man. There isn't any youth left. He's not getting any better, and he knows it.

Noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a lint brush and combs his head.

Adam sits alone in his empty house. It's a mess. He looks unhinged.

He slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on his flat screen TV, which has been moved to the floor to make room for Rachel's painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to I Love Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on ESPN. He turns the TV off. He's bored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam crosses to the answering machine. It reads "10 Messages." He presses play. All the messages are from his mother. He hits delete.

</DIRECTION>
<SETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "The Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Gladly. This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women, and children run through the streets in horror. People are sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model devours a villager.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to Pliny the Younger - "You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The tourists take pictures. In shock, Seth quickly shuttles the group away.

He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man. He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles match. He continues down the hall towards the exit.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Adam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging, biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He looks like a raisin among grapes.

Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back.

Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange a smile.

We FREEZE on the family sitting around the dinner table.

We hear the song "That's the Way The World Goes Round" by John Prine as we:
