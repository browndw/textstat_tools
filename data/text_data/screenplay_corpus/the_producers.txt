BIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know who I used to be? Max Bialystock! The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once. Lunch at Delmonico's. Two hundred dollar suits. Look at me. Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt!

</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
HE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to have thousands of investors begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock production.

</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
HE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES.

	Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
HE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE. LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLOOM. HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S DILEMMA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One ... Two ...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLOOM. HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

	Yes, sir. Thank you.

</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
HE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
HE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF. LOOKS AT WINDOW. NO GOOD. LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF. GRIMACES. FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES IT AGAINST THE WINDOW. HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE. HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING. BLOOM IS WATCHING. THEIR EYES MEET. BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT. BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW DOWN INTO THE STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA: SHOT OF STREET. BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW. A WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK.

	Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.

</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
IN HIS ANXIETY, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET TAKES OUT THE OLD BLUE BLANKET AND NERVOUSLY STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH IT.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function under these conditions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BIALYSTOCK CURIOUSLY EYES THE BLANKET.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making me extremely nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that? A handkerchief?

</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOM QUICKLY BEGINS TO PUT AWAY HIS BLUE BLANKET.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing ... nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK AS A FLASH, BIALYSTOCK REACHES OVER AND SNATCHES IT OUT OF BLOOM'S HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's nothing, why can't I see it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>

BLOOM LEAPS UP IN HOT PURSUIT OF HIS BLANKET.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(shrieking in panic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My blanket. Give me my blue blanket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BIALYSTOCK, TAKEN ABACK, HURRIEDLY GIVES THE BLANKET BACK TO BLOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, don't panic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(clutching his blanket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>

(recovering his dignity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bialystock ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
BIALYSTOCK MOVES AROUND THE DESK TO EXAMINE THE LEDGER.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where? What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to the backer's list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should they find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant. The word 'count' is part of your title.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(aghast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's cheating!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning. Other men sail through life. Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I'm going under. I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom, I'm reaching out to you. Don't send me to jail. Help! Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT ACROSS HIS CHEEK.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>

	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Help!

<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's all right ... wha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(pouring over the accounts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crossing to couch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake me if there's a fire.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.

<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES. HE COMES TO THE END AND IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM. HE COMPARES PAGES.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(musing to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It's absolutely amazing. But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE. HIS EYES POP OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO BLOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes. It's quite possible. If he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM. HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS. HE MOVES TO BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION. BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes???
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOM LOOKS UP. HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO CLOSE TO HIS OWN.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(at a loss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you were saying. Keep talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was I saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's quite possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES BIALYSTOCK. HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A STUDENT.
</DIRECTION>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simply a matter of creative accounting. Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assume away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? What did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made your error. You didn't go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. And how long did it run?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if the play was a hit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What scheme?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<BLOOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. It's just a thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLOOM>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIALYSTOCK>
<DIRECTION>
BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so simple. Step one: We find the worst play in the world -- a sure flop. Step two: I raise a million dollars -- there's a lot of little old ladies in this world. Step three: You go back to work on the books. Phoney lists of backers -- one for the government, one for us. You can do it, Bloom, you're a wizard. Step four: We open on Broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on Broadway. Step six: We take our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.

BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR. BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.

	Yes. Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns. Two-three-kick-turn! Turn- turn-kick-turn! It's enough to make you throw up! At last a chance to do straight drama! To deal with conflict, with inner truth. Roger De Bris presents history. Of course, I think we should add a little music. That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war. It's too depressing. We'll have to put something in there.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF FUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEBKIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. You see. This is the slow fuse. It is much wider. It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEBKIND>
<BIALYSTOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?

</LIEBKIND>
<DIRECTION>
HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY. BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN. HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION. NOTHING HAPPENS. AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.
