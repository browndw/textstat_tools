EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN

Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of rocky desert. Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur.

SIX MONTHS AGO

<DIRECTION>
AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep. He is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS. The sheepherder looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approach from the East. They touch down near the base of the ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR FIGURES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear. They wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the teeth. To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the figures turns to the East. We can see the rising sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward. They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.

INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The shrine is empty. The woman activates a wearable computing device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels, studying the floor. In the corner of the room she identifies a particular brick and presses it. We hear hidden COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up --

ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma.

We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface features beneath them. SOMETHING has been buried down there.

<ASHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a body --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASHER>
<DIRECTION>
Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit. The image resolves further. It's definitely a BODY. Then, we hear the low RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --

slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.

Wolfe points at the ground. A tiny depression has formed, with sand funneling into it.

Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole. The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression gradually widening. Curious, Wolfe leans closer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLAWED, ARMORED HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly EXPLODES upward from the ground. It latches onto Wolfe's neck. dragging him down head-first!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wolfe THRASHES, his head still buried beneath the sand. He knocks over the lantern, which FLICKERS, shorting out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asher rushes to Wolfe's side. Then Grimwood. They grab Wolfe by the shoulders, SCREAMING, trying to pull him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asher is KICKED by Wolfe's thrashing legs. He flies upward, hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned --

<DIRECTION>
Danica joins Grimwood. Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free -- headless. BLOOD erupts from the sand. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HELLISH CREATURE

unearths itself, ROARING. It's difficult to make out in the flickering light. But what we do see is terrifying. Spiked, demonic armor, clutching a sword. An elongated, helmeted face with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an inhuman physiognomy within. The hinged jaws open, coming at us.

Asher, Grirnwood, and another vampire, HENDRIX are gathered by a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security system.

<VANCE>

	Yes. I've long believed that in order to achieve true health, we have to reconcile the body and the mind. Of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions, which is what my work is all about.

	Monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external. In the case of vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism. These are scary subjects for people to own up to.

	Blade is a very disturbed individual. Even the name he's chosen for himself is troubling. According to witnesses, he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. You have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here. What does a person like Blade really want? Odds are, he's really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma. He thinks he's slaying monsters, but he's really trying to murder aspects of himself.

The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk, PLOWING DOWN newspaper vending machines and table-top displays piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart. PEDESTRIANS duck for cover and --

A depressing, dimly lit, partially open-air station. Abigail moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted. She glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Just the wind MOANING in the tunnels, across the platform. Then we hear a RUSTLING SOUND --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail looks right, sees nothing. We hear ANOTHER SOUND, this time from the left --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a FIGURE ducking behind a concrete pillar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby. She backs up a few steps, trying to look around the pillar --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but no one is there. Then a SHADOW MOVES behind her. She SENSES it, spinning --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but again, she seems to be alone. Thoroughly frightened now, Abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- slams right into Dingo and Proof! She GASPS.

-- right into the arms of Flick and Squid! They grab her, RIPPING the BabyBjorn carrier from her chest, SHOVING her back at Dingo and Proof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In seconds, Dingo and Proof have Abigail on the floor. They're tearing away at her clothing, LAUGHING.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Scream if this hurts, chica!

<DIRECTION>
ON FLICK,
</DIRECTION>

removing the BABY from its carrier. He holds the baby up - only it's not a baby. It's a DOLL with the words "FUCK YOU!" written on its chest. Flick is briefly confused --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then the baby doll EXPLODES, covering Flick's face with a cloud of GARLIC GAS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face --

<FLICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--aghhk -- it's fucking garlic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLICK>
<DIRECTION>
ON DINGO AND PROOF,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking back, alarmed. Then Abigail pulls her knee to her chest. A SILVER SPIKE springs out from the toe of her boot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She KICKS UP, imbedding the spike up through the underside of Proof's chin. Proof ASHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a leglock, FLIPPING him back onto his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABIGAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat. Long tresses of hair spill around her shoulders. She's not mousy at all. In fact, she's beautiful. And cut like an Olympic athlete. And equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH! Abigail plants her heel in his face, SMASHING IN his nose. She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again. Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES. He goes down as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Flick and Squid come charging! Squid gets her in a CHOKE HOLD. She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the nuts as he lands. He curls up, GROANING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her wrist. She POPs the knife through Squid's chest. He ASHES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING ABIGAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE secured to her back. She holds the crescent in the center, the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINKT! The device extends from either end, telescoping outward into a three-foot long metal arc. Connecting the two ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm. His arm falls, ASHING. Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling away to reveal Abigail in the background --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail gives her UV arc a twist. It retracts. She secures it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking "bloop" GUN with a large barrel. She FIRES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dingo goes down again. He panics, trying to scrape the gunk off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail calmly approaches. She stands over Dingo, staring down at him with a look of cruel indifference. She holsters her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE --
</DIRECTION>
<ABIGAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scream if this hurts, chica.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABIGAIL>
<DIRECTION>
-- and SLAMS the stake into his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail turns, surveying her work. The ashen remains of the vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers. In thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A train approaches, pulls into the station. PASSENGERS disembark, flood the platform. They tramp all over the ashes of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away.

TWO MORE AGENTS

CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in. They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS. As Blade moves to engage them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory --

A reinforced door EXPLODES inward. MORE AGENTS storm inside.
</DIRECTION>

a military Zodiac (inflatable boat) roars up one of the wooden boat ramps, laden with gun-toting AGENTS. They jump out, fanning all over the boat house.

Then he reaches for another, THROWING him THROUGH a window at the rear, out into the river which runs below --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WHISTLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he moves with increased urgency. The armory is filling up with tear gas. Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank of computers, types in a series of commands --

around him synch up, showing the same protocol message:

With each successive command, the workstations themselves begin self-destructing, EXPLODING one after another.

Another agent gets a bead on Whistler, FIRING a round into Whistler's thigh. Whistler SCREAMS --

EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane force. In the midst of the conflagration --

<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

FADE IN. We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face. His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK. We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window. Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining down on him. He looks disoriented, battered. Very weak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who --?

Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away.

<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many people have you killed? Thirty? Forty? A hundred?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUMBERLAND>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those were familiars -- people who worked for them --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And by "them" you mean vampires, right? I suppose next you'll be telling us that Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? Maybe you can give us some pointers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(counting on his ringers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can stake 'em, right? Then there's sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? Do those still work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUMBERLAND>
<HALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Ray. What if a vampire's Jewish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALE>
<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a good point. And does garlic work on a Hindu vampire? Or do you need saffron or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUMBERLAND>
<DIRECTION>
Hale laughs. Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading.
</DIRECTION>
<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want, Blade, but it's not going to play. You're a stone-cold killer. And you're sick as fuck.

ANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing in the doorway. He's the man we saw on Larry King. He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Blade. My name is Doctor Vance. I'm with the Department of Mental Health. I've been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cumberland and Hale)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few moments alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Cumberland nods. They rise, exiting the room. Vance smiles, trying to project a sympathetic air.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine this must be very frightening for you. But I want you to know that I'm here to help. In order to do that, however, I need to ask you some questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. Can you tell me what day it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Blade just stares daggers at Vance.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the President? Do you know who's in the White House at the moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An ass-hole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright then, let's talk about vampires -- what can you tell me about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have joined Chief Vreede. We hear Blade and Vance via speakers:
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing to tell. They exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And are you one of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vance sits forward, drawing closer.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about blood? When you drink it, do you find yourself sexually aroused?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Blade just glares at Vance.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, it strikes me that this business of vampirism has strong connotations of sexual confusion. Bodily fluids being exchanged, that sort of thing. You have to ask where that comes from. I'm wondering, for instance, what your relationship was like with your mother. Were the two of you close?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Blade glares. If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale.
</DIRECTION>
<VREEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your assessment, Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VREEDE>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's psychotic, with paranoid features, possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy. He's exhibiting disorganized behavior. He obviously doesn't have a properly formed conscience --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(spreading his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For his safety and the public's, I'm recommending that he be transferred to County Psychiatric for further treatment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's unacceptable. This man's wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes. I need him on a plane to the Detention Center in Washington tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUMBERLAND>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agent Cumberland, that man is in no condition to undergo prosecution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<HALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant here that clearly supersedes --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALE>
<VREEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care about your warrant. We're in my jurisdiction now. You've got an issue with that, you take it up with the local magistrate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VREEDE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has already been made. A team from the hospital should be here momentarily to oversee the transfer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by FOUR VAMPIRES dressed as orderlies. The orderlies carry a straightjacket, various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danica approaches the DESK SERGEANT, flashing a hospital ID.
</DIRECTION>
<DANICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. We're here to transfer a patient to County General?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANICA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vance enters once more. He opens the leather case on the table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking softly now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little something to keep you compliant. The normal dose is two, maybe three hundred milligrams. But for a strapping young hybrid like yourself --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I think we'll kick it up to a couple thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Vance reaches for Blade's arm. Blade struggles, tries to pull back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're weak, aren't you? In need of your serum. Who would've guessed a mere human like myself could overpower you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're with them -- a familiar --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going on five years now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to reveal a VAMPIRE GLYPH tattooed on the underside of his wrist. Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade.
</DIRECTION>
<VANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the end-game, Blade. All their plans are finally coming to fruition. So just sit back and enjoy the show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VANCE>
<DIRECTION>
Blade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's one of them! Damnit, he's working for them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to say -- "The man's deranged. What can I do?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging lunatic. Vance enters. He extends his hand to Vreede.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They shake. As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the inside of Vreede's wrist as well. Another familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror. He blinks, trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elevator door opens. Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit, followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney. As they move down the corridor, they pass --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede.
</DIRECTION>
<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hold it right there --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUMBERLAND>
<DIRECTION>
Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cumberland looks to Hale. Something isn't right about this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLADE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving trails as he shifts his head from side to side and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enter, followed by two of the orderlies. Despite his incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise. Danica plants her heel in his chest, shoving him back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DANICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANICA>
<DIRECTION>
She draws closer, enjoying herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DANICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We moved the humans around like, pawns, Blade. Used them to flush you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANICA>
<DIRECTION>
Blade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK! Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw. A brutal blow.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIMWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Captain Sunshine. Soon as we get you out of here, you'll get a chance to play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIMWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies. They step forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade. Blade THRASHES madly. Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this.
</DIRECTION>
<DANICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make this any harder than it has to be. You're all alone, Blade. No one can help you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANICA>
<DIRECTION>
BA-BOOM! The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room! Seconds later --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing two high-tech electronic pistols. Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an irrepressible grin. Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name is" sticker with the words "FUCK YOU" written where the name should be.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly --
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He kept biting his own lip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DANICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	King!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANICA>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go out. Immediately, backup lights come on, followed by FIRE ALARMS. In the ensuing confusion ~ both pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire orderlies behind him to take the hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside out. (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS, explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King whips around, FIRING at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table. She quickly upends it, using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shifts his weight, throwing himself and the chair he's sitting on to the floor. Then he KICKS OUT AND UP --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- connecting with Grimwood's mid-section, sending him FLYING BACKWARDS -- straight through the wall into the next room!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King holsters one of his pistols and hauls Blade up. At the same time, he FIRES on Asher again, missing him --
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's FLY, kemosabe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
King drags Blade to the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- into the neighboring corridor. Cumberland and Hale SEE them. They reach for their weapons --
</DIRECTION>
<CUMBERLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's getting away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUMBERLAND>
<DIRECTION>
King FIRES into the room behind him, then pulls a GRENADE secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EXPLOSION rocks the interrogation room, filling the corridor with smoke, knocking Cumberland and Hale back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King turns his attention to Blade's handcuffs, FIRING between them, freeing Blade's hands. Blade collapses against the wall. He's shaking, close to passing out.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
King drags Blade up. They continue down the corridor to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABIGAIL, THE FEMALE VAMPIRE HUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we met earlier. She's engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a half-dozen UNIFORMED OFFICERS. Three of them are already down. In seconds, she finishes off the other three.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whistler! We need that serum NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler? Abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a kick to the mid-section while tossing a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR at King. He snatches it, places it in Blade's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade injects himself in the neck. Moments later, he's reenergized. He looks to King, clear-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Blade responds by PUNCHING King across the jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me that again and I'll give you fucking brain damage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
King massages his jaw, tossing Blade a pistol even as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Grimwood rounds the corner, hungry for blood, TWO MORE VAMPIRE ORDERLIES behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade FIRES round after round of EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, causing Grimwood and the others to fall back. Blade and King move, joining Abigail. MORE SMOKE, darkness, only the emergency lights to illuminate the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP AHEAD,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a group of POLICEMEN spill from a stairwell, armed with bullet proof vests. They OPEN FIRE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade, King, and Abigail retreat into an alcove. They're pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're pinned down!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you do something?!

</BLADE>
<ABIGAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABIGAIL>
<DIRECTION>
As King and Blade lay down COVER FIRE, Abigail reaches behind her, withdrawing a device that's been secured there. She gives it a SNAP and it springs open, taking the shape of a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FUTURISTIC COMPOUND BOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions with vibration-dampening modules, this bow is capable of firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet-per-second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail withdraws a SILVER ARROW with a time-delay explosive tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mounted at the end of the corridor. She lets her arrow fly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH THE ARROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it banks off the side of the fire extinguisher, continuing down the side corridor where it embeds itself in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the shoulder of one of the vampires! The vampire SCREAMS, grabbing the shaft, ripping it out. Then we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACRO-ZOOM ON THE ARROW HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny "egg-timer" dial on the arrowhead spins. It CLICKS in place, a RED LED comes on, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the arrowhead EXPLODES, catching all three vampires with the full force of a UV BLAST. Grimwood ducks away from the blast as the other two vampires ASH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLADE, KING, AND ABIGAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
come racing out of the alcove. They reach a stairwell. Blade RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging up the stairs. The cops go down like ten-pins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade and company have an opening. But as they charge downward --
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sword. They still have it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you insane?! We're practically home free! We can't go hunting for your fucking butter-knife now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
But Blade is already heading back the way they came and --
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! HEY!!! COME BACK HERE!!! This is supposed to be a rescue!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
-- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ABIGAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it, King. Let's move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ABIGAIL>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King and Abigail rush outside. The station is gated. FLASHING POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate. They're trapped. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD. Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in a cat-like crouch. With his sword in his hand. He looks at King, grins, flips him off.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<KING>
<DIRECTION>
(nudging Abigail)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he epic or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with FIREPOWER. Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEADLIGHTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are washing over them. A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is SCREAMING up the street. The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk, SMASHES right through the gated wall. SCREECHES to a stop between our trio and the police cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DRIVER (DEX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors pop open. Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Dex. And I'll be saving your ass this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEX>
<DIRECTION>
Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land Cruiser. Dex reverses, backing out the way he came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off.
</DIRECTION>

In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield --

ABIGAIL'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land Cruiser. Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in her bow. She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHUNKT! The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye. He goes down, his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background as the Land Cruiser speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT

Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a battle well fought. Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone.

	So my entrance back there -- what do you think? Too flashy? Right on the money?

King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs.

Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>

	That's right, Blade. You're not hearing things. She's Whistler's daughter. You see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part of Whistler's "contingency plan".

The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park. We pass by the skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Once, all of my kind could brave the day. We were true predators. The world was ours. And then, somewhere along the way, the purity of our bloodline became diluted. Polluted with human DNA.

Drake stands, drawing close to Danica. He grips her wrist --

<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are bastard children. No longer as pure as you pride yourselves on being.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRAKE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts. To her credit, Danica keeps staring at Drake. She'll be damned if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake pulls her hand closer to the light -- to the very edge. And the tips of Danica's fingers begin to burn. She winces, clearly in agony --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Drake releases her hand. She cradles it against her chest, blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My people. How far you have fallen.

INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade, King, and Abigail stand before a table where an assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on display. Hedges is there too, assisting them. Zoe watches.
</DIRECTION>
<HEDGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got a wide assortment of ass- kickery for your viewing pleasure --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hefting a pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Electronic pistol. Comes with a built-in fingerprint security system. Fires a three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second. Bullets can also be triggered remotely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEDGES>
<DIRECTION>
King tosses Blade a bullet. He studies it -- it's more complex than a standard round.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Explosive rounds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But with a concentrated burst of UV light instead of your standard hollow-points. I call 'em sun dogs.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hedges -- super-size me, baby!

Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms. On the stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This little mamacita -- a modified version of the Army's Objective Individual Combat Weapon. Pick your poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking mini-rockets. Whatever gets you hard, this puppy will pump out.

(gesturing to Blade's sword, sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it doesn't have the range of a sword but --

Next, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that Abigail used. He gives the device a twist and --
</DIRECTION>
<HEDGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We call this the UV arc --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEDGES>
<DIRECTION>
CHINKT! The device extends from either end, telescoping outward. Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER.
</DIRECTION>
<HEDGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hold the arc in the center, curved away from you. Connecting the tips is a powerful UV laser beam. Because of its high focus, the laser cuts through vampire flesh like a knife through butter.
	</DIALOGUE>

<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to Dracula. Turning into mist? Kinda doubt it. But general shape-shifting? Maybe.

	How?

</BLADE>
<HEDGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure. Probably something more like a snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array. Commensurate with this would be an exquisite control of electrical potential across his tissues, resulting in an ability to effectively change shape at will --

<DIRECTION>
Blade, King, and Abigail, newly suited up for war, moving towards the Land Cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to apply some pressure. The weak link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars. Vampires can't go out in the day, so they get humans to do their dirty work for them Blood-running, safe house maintenance, whatever --

<DIRECTION>
Blade looks to Abigail, who sits in the back. She has a laptop on her knees and is assembling an MP3 playlist.
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's making playlists. Likes to listen to MP3s when she hunts. Her own internal soundtrack, you know? Dark-core, trip hop, whatever kids these days are listening to. Me? I'm more of a Kenny G fan.

Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on her portable MP3 player. MUSIC CUE. The smoking bassline of Jurassic 5's 'A Day At The Races' kicks in as --

<DIRECTION>
The Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front of a scuzzy bar. Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and flyers we see a vampire glyph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! Blade KICKS open the door. A couple of LOW-LIFES take notice. Blade moves around the bar, opening a refrigerator - we see packs of REFRIGERATED BLOOD inside.

<DIRECTION>
One of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms. She trips him up, swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him. She pulls the back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing, raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner.

EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets.

In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a pool hall --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- an internet cafe --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- an electronics repair shop --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to oldfashioned strong-arm tactics:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Abigail KICKS a familiar in the stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to a flurry of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of VAMPIRE GLYPHS being exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another --

more abstract until --

EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WHAM! Blade tosses HOOP, a skinny familiar, off a roof. It's a four story drop. Hoop falls, SCREAMING -- but then jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's ankles. And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling upside down. King and Abigail look on.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Dr. Vance, the psychiatrist who gave Blade the mental evaluation, is cruising in his Pacific Blue XKB convertible Jaguar. He's wearing sunglasses, talking on his cell phone.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDGAR VANCE, M.D.

	Regain control of your life. Wake to a new dawn. At the Vance Institute for Whole Being we believe in an integrated approach to human health.

The image cuts to Vance himself, poised on the edge of his desk, smiling. As Blade and company move through the institute, the video plays counterpoint to their progress.

VANCE'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies on the floor. His throat has been ripped out. And this body is dressed like a doctor.

King puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath the Vance double's flesh --
</DIRECTION>
<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, it's him! It's Drake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KING>
<DIRECTION>
The Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS a glass window. Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING him clear across the office as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- King advances. The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones in his head shifting around. He reaches for King, SLAMS him onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top.

Then the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape.

<DIRECTION>
DRAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow.

She spins, falling --

Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST.

SMASH! A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking Blade. He lets go with one hand, swings outward --

Another story, a third, a fourth. As he reaches the top, Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him --

KING'S POV

<DIRECTION>
The rottweiler we saw earlier is slobbering all over him.

PULL BACK to reveal King on his knees, shirtless, both wrists secured behind him in a high-tech pillory. King tries to twist his head away from the dog. The rottweiler GROWLS.

	Back off, pooch --

</KING>
<DIRECTION>
The rottweiler's jaws open, revealing more teeth than any dog should probably have.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its muzzle splits in two as both sides of the rottweiler mandible fold back on either side of its head, disgorging a hellish and barbed tongue stalk! The mutant dog ROARS, ready to bite King's face off and --

<KING>

Grimwood moves in to choke him again, but Danica intervenes.

<DANICA>

	You're brave, King, I'll give you that. But underneath all your swagger --

She leans closer, caressing his face.

<DANICA>

King's smile falters for a moment. Maybe she does know. She rubs her cheek against his.

King tries to turn his head away, but Danica grips his chin, turning his head back. He's sweating now. Worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DANICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to bite you again, King. And then I'm going to leave you here while you turn. I'm going to watch you, day after day, while the Thirst keeps building and building. And then, when you can't stand it anymore --

She nods. Drake appears, holding Zoe. She's alive. Terrified. Held firm in Drake's arms.

Abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her bows. Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer to measure arrow speed.

CLOSE ON Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion, re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the center-shot position and wheel timing, etc.

Abigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work.

She stands, moving to the shooting range. She straps on a quiver, takes aim at

A 3-D HUMAN-SHAPED TARGET

about a hundred feet away. Just in front of the target is the chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! Abigail FIRES an arrow. It flies through the arms of the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest. On the screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked at 240 feet per second. We move CLOSER to her now as--

WHOOSH! Abicail FIRES again. The speed is 242 fps. CLOSER --

WHOOSH! Now the speed is 269 fps. EVEN CLOSER --

WHOOSH!WHOOSH!WHOOSH! 285 fps. 302 fps. 315 fps! The arrow speed creeps up and up as we move CLOSER AND CLOSER to Abigail until we --

Her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear.

<SOMMERFIELD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've managed to cultivate a workable strain of the Daystar virus. As a precaution, I transmitted the genetic sequence to Caulder, in case our main stock was destroyed. In order for it to achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to interfuse it with Drake's blood. If it works, any vampires in the immediate vicinity should die almost instantly. After that, it should take only a few weeks for the virus to spread throughout the rest of the world.

Zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject.

<SOMMERFIELD>

flood in from multiple entry ways. It's an all-out melee. Blade is seriously overwhelmed, but the sheer number of vampires and humans is actually slowing them down.
</DIRECTION>

Blade takes on a half-dozen of them at once, stunning one of the familiars, using him as a human shield, TOSSING him aside to trip up another on-rushing pair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he pauses, instantly calculating the geography of the room, the relative positions of the other combatants, assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons. His battle plan ready, Blade engages his enemies once again.

VAMPIRES AND HUMAN FAMILIARS

Abigail PUNCHES one in the solar plexus, DECAPITATES another, finishes off the first. Then she's moving on, taking down a third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake dispenser. Throwing stakes with blinding speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty. Without missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and slaps it in place. The mayhem continues.

Grimwood is furious. His men are tripping all over themselves. He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to the wall. He sees an opening, SWINGS at Blade's head --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's own men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing. He cuts down another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face. Grimwood swings his axe again. Blade hooks his sword beneath it, FLIPPING it from Grimwood's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc, CUTTING straight through Grimwood's mid-section. The upper half of Grimwood's body topples away --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then he rights himself. A half-vampire. He's still alive, running forward on his hands, trailing viscera. He SPRINGS UP at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and manages to IMPALE what's left of Grimwood with his sword-point. Grimwood ASHES in Blade's arms. The only thing left are his steel teeth, which CLATTER to the floor at Blade's feet.

Abigail enters, SEES Zoe. TWO VAMPIRES GUARDS stand nearby. In a flash, Abigail flings TWO SILVER STAKES at them. Both stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ASH.

Abigail hurries over, SHOOTS apart the lock on Zoe's shackle. Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight. Abigail takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door.

Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands before him, waiting, sword in hand. He extends it, touching the tip to the floor. A challenge.
</DIRECTION>
<DRAKE>

Drake does a back-flip over the balcony. Forty feet down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade follows, drawing his sword as he LEAPS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and lands. Now the two warriors face each other, swords raised, eyes locked, their stances frozen. Like classic samurai. Whoever moves first, loses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. MOVING IN on both men, CIRCLING around them. Slow the heart. Slow the breath. Find the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it takes to blink an eye. No one could possibly deflect the blow. And yet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
manages a COUNTER-STROKE with super-human grace. He advances, parries, his sword CLANGING and SINGING like a blacksmith's hammer on sheet metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes. The moves come faster. Drake DUCKS, barely avoiding being decapitated. Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake retaliates. Blade locks swords with him. For a moment, the two warriors are nose to nose. Then Blade twists his sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake GROWLS, back-flipping up onto a ledge. He touches his fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood. Then we hear the telltale sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING. For a brief moment, his facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his true form. As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He DIVES at Blade, HOWLING, raking his CLAWS at Blade's face. He strikes out, KNOCKING Blade across the atrium. He SPRINGS forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs into Blade's shoulder. Blide SCREAMS and we --

UP AHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a dead-end. Just plate glass windows and a whole lot of nothing beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dogs are almost on King when suddenly, King JUMPS, snagging an overhead pipe. As he swings his body upward --
</DIRECTION>

THE DOGS

skid on the floor, unable to stop their momentum, and CRASH straight through the plate glass window.

INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

King drops back to the floor, cackling, pleased with himself. It takes him a second to realize that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE OF THE ROTTWEILERS (BEAU)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- didn't take a swan dive out the window. He's right behind King. And now he's SPRINGING FORWARD --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! King is hit in the chest by the SNARLING beast. He drops the pistol as he's knocked back onto the floor. The dog LUNGES again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one arm, King struggles to keep his face from being bit off, while searching blindly for the discarded pistol. King locates it, FIRING into the beast's chest --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ROTTWEILER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASHES, disintegrating all over King's face. King gets a mouthful of the charcoal remains, tries to SPIT them out.

Abigail emerges onto the gallery with Zoe. She spots an alcove, indicates that Zoe should hide. Then she slips a silver stake into Zoe's hand. Just in case.

Abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at Blade and Drake. Her view is obscured. She can't get a good shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake digs his fangs into Blade's shoulder. Blade struggles, manages to slip a stake from his bandolier --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Blade SLAMS the stake into Drake's ear canal. The beast SHRIEKS in pain, dropping Blade. But all the gambit has done is drive Drake into a berserker rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake swings his fist. Blade ducks. Drake's fist goes through the wall, PUNCTURING a steam pipe. Steam vents --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake reaches in, RIPS an eight-foot section of the pipe from the wall, bringing a SPARKING nest of electrical cables along with it. He swings the pipe section around, WHACKING Blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRUNCH! Drake swings the makeshift club again. He's a one man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path. He's SMASHING holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through partitions of glass and steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Abigail moves down the gallery, looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
span the length of the atrium ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- catching hold of one of the crosspieces. Like an acrobat, she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry. If she loses her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BA-BANG! A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering her with SPARKS. MORE BULLETS follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PAIR OF VAMPIRES
</DIRECTION>

FIRING from below, trying to pick her off. Suddenly, UV BULLETS strike each of the vampires. As they ASH we --
</DIRECTION>

WHIP-PAN BACK TO KING,

</DANICA>
<DIRECTION>
DANICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears behind King. She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the floor, pummeling his face with her fist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched. He swings his electronic pistol up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the stock. King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to Abigail. She's breathing heavily, trying to call up new reserves of strength. She glances down --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She forces herself to look back up. She swings herself pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece. A SHOT RINGS OUT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ASHER,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
down below, armed with a rifle. He FIRES again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet. Abigail CRIES OUT, nearly losing her grip.
</DIRECTION>

King pulls the trigger. The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT with UV LIGHT. Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already burning face from the glare. She runs, horribly wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty feet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH! Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging glass chandelier/lighting fixture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. Drake pounces on him. Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows anymore. In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an entire section of the limestone flooring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air, knocking Blade off his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the railing, and FIRES at Asher --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUN DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's open mouth. The bullet EXPLODES. UV LIGHT causes Asher's skull to burn up from the inside out. His headless corpse falls forward over the gallery railing. Then it too carbonizes and BURNS UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved, King sinks to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND KING,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we SEE Zoe slip from the alcove. She makes for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King has bought Abigail more time. She swings her body forward, hooking her legs over the next crosspiece. Then she lets go with her hands. Now she is hanging upside down, secured only by the tension in her calves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abigail reaches behind her, removes her bow. BLOOD from her wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone, reaching her cheek, briefly obscuring her vision. She wipes it away. Then she reaches back once more and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- because her quiver is pointed downward, a number of arrows slide out. Abigail panics, twisting her body --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- managing to lust barely snag the ~la~ue arrow as it tumbles Past her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Abigail shuts her eyes, trying to find her center. With her eyes closed, she nocks the arrow and draws the bow back. Then she opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's only going to get one shot -- and she's going to have to take it while hanging upside down.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake shoulders a support column, SNAPPING it in two. An entire section of the gallery walkway above comes CRASHING DOWN, burying Blade in debris --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but it's not enough for Drake. He LEAPS forward, fishing Blade out, hauling him up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake head-butts Blade -- once, twice. Blade's eyes roll to whites. Drake looks down, SEES Blade's discarded sword. Drake scoops it up, STRIKES at Blade --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade manages to roll to the side, avoiding the blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake STRIKES again, dealing Blade a glancing blow --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ABIGAIL. Waiting. More blood has trickled down her neck, into her eyes. But she can't wipe them anymore. She's already got her bow drawn. She's committed to the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear ABIGAIL'S HEARTBEAT as she settles. She takes a final breath, holds it -- and lets the plague arrow fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PLAGUE ARROW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it streaks downward, hurtling towards Drake at more than 300 feet per second. Then, at the last possible instant --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINGG! Drake deflects the arrow with his sword. It harmlessly falls to the floor, rolling a few yards away.

ON ABIGAIL,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stunned, her expression melting into despair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO DRAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swinging Blade's sword around. PLUNGING it into Blade's side. As he pulls it back out again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASPS, sinking downward. He's on his knees now, in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of violence and predation. And the nightmare shape that was only hinted at before, finally takes center-stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson. His canines elongate, his lower jaw distends. Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing a suit of razor-sharp thorns. He doesn't need a sword anymore. He's become a living weapon. Drake is gone. Now he is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake swings the sword overhead. He's going to decapitate Blade. And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver stake. She SHOVES it into Drake's back, pushing with all the strength her little body can muster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drake staggers. The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the same. He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for one crucial second --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BLADE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
summoning the last of his reserves. He pitches his body forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow. And before Drake even realizes what is happening --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest. Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE DRAKE'S CHEST - MACRO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon. We SEE the virus flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as his circulatory system carries it throughout his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DRAKE'S FACE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
letting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood mist. His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into his more familiar face. At the same time we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GO MACR0 ONCE MORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake expelled. We continue shrinking until we are moving with the individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANICA,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
having retreated from her defeat by King. She clutches her throat. We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny BLACK THREADS expand across her face. She sways, falling onto the floor. She reaches a beseeching hand towards King --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE VAMPIRES

are feeling the effects now too. One by one they drop, choking, going into convulsions. As they writhe on the floor, we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies.
