EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it. BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture. PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily shakes.

Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference. There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JFK>

To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering all the guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere in the middle we cut outside.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel. Then he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light. Red submarine light shines up from below. All the while he and Helen are chatting:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>

Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF LIGHTS COMING ON. The echoes of the sounds suggest a large, cavernous space. All we can see is the cinder block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin begins to shut by putting his body into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick of time.

	Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!

CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING AND THEN, AGAIN USING THE DEVICE OF A CUTAWAY, IT CONTINUES THROUGH DIRT AND SEDIMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SURFACE-- WHERE THE BACKYARD AVOCADO TREES ARE BEING BULLDOZED AND THE BACK FENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN TORN DOWN. THE WEBBER HOUSE FACED A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT IT BACKED ONTO VICTORY AVENUE (OR ONE OF THOSE VALLEY AVENUES) AND IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES THOSE MAIN THOROUGHFARES WENT COMMERCIAL.

Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before him.

He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has redesigned. The new skates look kind of like rollerblades.

Helen enters and goes into the generator room. Through the glass we can see (and hear) her scream. Straightening her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin strolls by wearing his tool belt. She's headed out.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the generator room again?

CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years. Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM GOES OFF. Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by throwing the lever up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE

reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of the front hatchway and red box.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...we just open this door and go up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...is that supposed to happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs through the entire shelter to the back hatch door. They knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam follows.

	Hey, where are we going?! Is everything all right?!

Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is out of breath.

<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we say a little prayer first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just open the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't. Adam helps him. Helen pitches in. Slowly, with lots of squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and flips a wall switch. Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON.... And the service elevator is intact.

Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully. The old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR. All that's left of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign. There's ANOTHER SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it is. The alley way on the left has always been there.
</DIRECTION>

TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the Soda Jerk, now a dissipated middle-aged man (with a tattoo on his forehead.)

</SODA_JERK>
<DIRECTION>
The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back window. Soda Jerk is fearless. Until finally the HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO FLYING. Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter ticking.
</DIRECTION>
<SODA_JERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God! Oh, God!! Oh,God, save me!! For I have seen the light!!

Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

	I come in peace!!

The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his flashlight. He is horrified by what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My, gosh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back. He moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe) reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic container and strikes it against the wall. The MATCH BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and breathes the air. It stinks in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the avocado trees should be.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is my backyard?

He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY to his left.

EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present condition. In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome- plated word "Toyota." A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the avenue.

	So...you...survived the blast, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<STREET_WALKER>

	Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here?

	Really?

<STREET_WALKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't. I'm sorry! I have to go! I have to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to stay out. Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the curb where she TOSSES her cookies. TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at Calvin. When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol is really a water gun.

Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>

Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard and holding his chest. His family looks on with great concern. The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.

She slumps, then resumes her needless activity. Calvin takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops humming.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't.

Adam paces. Then Helen comes out. Behind her, we can see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living room. He follows.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He seems to be doing all right now. I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we need supplies and I've got to stay with him.

</HELEN>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go up.

Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the fish farm.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just act normal. If anybody asks, simply say you're from out-of-town, and that you're in town on business. Write that down.

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to give you a shopping list and some money. We need just enough things to get us through the next year or two. And you'll find most of these items at what used to be called a grocery store or a hardware store. Write that down.

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ADAM>

At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
They have stopped by the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>

INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>

He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box. Helen enters with a long shopping list.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed. He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her apron. Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak weakly into his son's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CALVIN>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ADAM>
<CALVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALVIN>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try.

And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious shrine. He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and around the broken cement. Currently he's on his knees, rocking back and forth as he prays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his face and to weep in fear. And, Adam, taking pity on the man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SODA_JERK>

<ADAM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SODA_JERK>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up his suitcase)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SODA_JERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SODA_JERK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I leave here?

EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but when he looks next door he sees he's in a different place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself he turns and begins to walk south.

Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar box in the other. He steps up to the counter where the owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a fondness for Navajo jewelry.

A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes to another counter. Neither man notices.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The name is Adam Webber and I see you buy baseball cards and although these are a lot older than the ones in the window, I was hoping you still might be interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches beyond his wildest dreams. Jerry actually moans and then must pretend the moan was a cough.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

</JERRY>

</JERRY>

He reaches in and looks through the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<JERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here on business.

	Hah! Adam and Eve! The perfect match! I hope you two will be very happy together! Mazel-fuckin'-tov! Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot! I'm serious this time! You're finished in the hobby business! Take that to the bank, why don'tcha!

</ADAM>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lost?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's nice.

</ADAM>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay. Right so far?

<ADAM>

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.

</ADAM>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again.

</EVE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was amazing.

<TROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think about it! The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.

Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward. Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve notices them noticing.

Eve and Cliff go to the bar. Adam sits down glumly. He looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet who is seated at a table with Heather. A GOOD LOOKING GUY is hitting on them. CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate. Then she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam smiles back. Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth, snapping his head back. It's not a big punch, but very, very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason and Jonathan.

Cliff draws back another right. Adam flicks out a quick left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes a beat or two then draws back his right fist again. Adam pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his side.

(sitting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.

	Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<TROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROY>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did he get all that information?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<TROY>

	From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROY>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.

	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter. That's where I was born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That's also why I have no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should "bring her on down". And you look plenty healthy to me.

BROWN appears from the kitchen. He's good-sized man who dresses casually. Adam becomes uneasy.

</ARON>

She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<ARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARON>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<ARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now you must let me be the judge of that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARON>
<EVE>

	Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a bitch!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARON>

Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto the street. He clips two parked cars as he does. Brown comes running from the side of the house. His pants are torn.

Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are; how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry. It makes her very sad. She picks up the toothpaste and holds it as if it were his ring.

The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter. There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound. But it is solid.

Eve lets Troy drive. She clutches the cigar box and rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the curb in front of the bookstore. A low rider passes them on the left. Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just used.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the lowlifes mentioned above. Now the street looks more like Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so aggressive.

(VO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's truly amazing what you can get done when you have unlimited funds. Did you know you can have whole houses built in just a matter of months. All you have to say is this..."I don't care what it costs." And then, of course, you've got to really mean it, which no one ever does.

INT. RETRO STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties. Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with. There's a lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or something) from the Webber living room.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>

	That lamp is perfect!

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See! I can't tell them that! I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke. I can't let that happen. You understand?

</ADAM>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!

</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(VO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our idea was to bring Adam's parents up to the surface very slowly. Make them very comfortable and then break the bad news to them that there was no nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't kill them Adam's going to tell his father about the Internet.

</CALVIN>
<ADAM>

(after a while)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure?

<CALVIN>

	That's what everybody believes?
