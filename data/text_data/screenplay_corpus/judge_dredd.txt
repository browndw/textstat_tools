A GROUND CREW member couples fat conduits to the underbelly of the docked aircraft. Suddenly an ARM wraps around his throat. He struggles and we see his captor, hanging upside down in the landing gear: Rico. He drops to the ground like an acrobat, Holding his victim all the way down. The man's neck SNAPS on impact. Rico drags the body into the shadows.
