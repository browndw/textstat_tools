Our roads are cracking, our bridges are crumbling and everything we used to build is made in Japan. We've got people sleeping in cardboard boxes, and ten-year-old kids who are doing drugs. We've been living together for four hundred years, and we're still trying to kill each other... But that isn't even the worst part. The worst part is we feel like we can't do anything about it.
