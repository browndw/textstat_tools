Stand- ing by is a French governess, Mlle. Roland, and a Nurse. Mlle. Roland is buxom.

<DIRECTION>
OBLONSKY'S POV--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dolly, in furs, the four youngest children and the Nurse, who carries Vasya, all wrapped up against the cold weather, have come out of the house to a waiting sleigh, as noisy as starlings, bickering, competing, reprimanding. The Oblonsky's Coachman assists, with a rug to spread across knees.

Oblonsky hands his coffee to Matvey and lights a small cigar. He detours to take a sugared almond from a dish of sweets, and leaves the room . . .

	My Tanruchoshka! Mind my cigar.

<DIRECTION>
Tanya runs back to her seat and bends to her schoolbook. Oblonsky looks Mlle. Roland in the eye. He moves his head slightly, unmistakably ask- ing her to come outside. Mlle. Roland moves her eyes at him in humorous reproach. Clearly, this is familiar ground. Oblonsky closes the door behind him.

Anna is at her dressing-table-bureau, which is host to at least two pho- tographs of a small boy (Serozha) and a child's unframed drawing of "Maman." As she starts reading the letter, Anna's eyes frown.

Anna is speaking to her husband "confidentially." Karenin, a busy man, drains his coffee cup and hands it (as with Oblonsky and Matvey) to his valet, Korney, who bows and withdraws. Karenin continues transferring papers from his desk to his portfolio . . .
</DIRECTION>

Which done, he nods to his private secretary, Mikhail Slyudin, who comes forward to receive it, bows and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>

Karenin is twenty years older than Anna and a senior figure in govern- ment. He has an unattractive reedy voice and is pleased with himself as a model of probity. He has the habit of cracking his knuckles.

	Stiva wants me to come to Moscow . . . to persuade Dolly to forgive him.

Anna, Kitty, Tanya and Grisha are at a handsome card table where board games, dominoes, cards, etc., are kept. There is a spill of alphabet bricks, each with a letter printed in it. They are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks. Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair. The spelling business, including misspellings by Grisha, creates a noise of laughter and mock-rebuke. Tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from Anna's finger.

With only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha- bet bricks. Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought. She closes her book, marking the place. She is going to go up to bed. She hears the sound of the doorbell.

Kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts. Everything has come together for Kitty--her dress, her hair, her skin, her moment. She radiates happiness.

Anna watches the dancing. She rejects an offer with a smile. She sees Vron- sky and to her discomfort Vronsky looks up and catches her looking.
</DIRECTION>

She turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are bowing as the Host and Hostess escort an overweight but glittering young couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the Austrian royal honeymooners . . . attended by the Guards Officer from the station. Anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon . . . where Oblonsky is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand.

Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with Anna. Kitty watches Anna dancing. Anna says something which makes Vronsky laugh. Anna laughs. Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes. Vron- sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It goes on like that. Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men, old men, from the wall. Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast, gaily, solemnly, gazes locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Others are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and eagle-eyed matrons. Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself.

They enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum- ference. Anna is flushed with pleasure. Among the surrounding dancers, Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna. Kitty, dancing, watches Vronsky incredulous.

Her own partner expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle, running towards the door.

Anna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage, making sense of what seems like a hallucination. Wind and snow batter on the window.

She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back at her. Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed.

There is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light. The guests react with cries of pleasure and applause.

Anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't notice anything, myself. But I saw that everyone else noticed. I consider jeal- ousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me. I have no right to inquire into your feelings.

(SERIOUSLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence. Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder. Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms.

EXT. STABLES, TSARSKOE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky with Alexander beside him clucks his tongue at the black opening of a stable and calls softly for Frou-Frou. There's a stir within and the mare's head appears. Vronsky opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful. A man would come to no harm. Do you think you'll win tomorrow?

He kisses Frou-Frou.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEADOW--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky sees Anna before she sees him. He pauses to look at her, struck by her beauty, full of love for her. She is lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<VRONSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VRONSKY>

She has not been expecting him. She is concerned.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexei, what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head: nothing. She comes to him and hides her face in his breast. He holds her tight, taking her hand and kissing it.
</DIRECTION>
<VRONSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.

	</DIALOGUE>

<ANNA>

She smiles rapturously.

</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him deeply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAZE, KARENIN'S RENTED HOUSE, TSARSKOE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a good maze. Anna and Serozha are running, laughing, between the hedges. It's a game. She is trying to find her way to him, chasing him. A hedge divides them. Serozha darts away from her, runs into a dead end, doubles back. She spots him, follows him, and now he has eluded her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serozha finds his way out of the maze and is confronted by Karenin.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, young man? Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence. We'll have a look at your lesson books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna, coming out of the maze, sees Karenin, recovers.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexei!--you got away at last. Can you stay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why . . . ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
Serozha looks scared to tears. Anna kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go and find Vasily Lukich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Serozha runs into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to change. Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me. Would you like to come?-- she's taking me to watch the race.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Karenin smiles coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Races, surely. No, I'll come on later, and then I must get back to town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna returns to the house. She wipes her kissed hand on her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RACES--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a rough-and-ready racecourse but the venue for a high society occa- sion, with a grandstand for top people and a grander section, ornamented for greater comfort, for members of the Imperial family. It is also a fashion parade for some.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The racecourse itself is an oval approached by a straight. There are nine fences, water-jumps, etc., of various difficulty. The "jockeys" are officers in the Guards, the Hussars and other regiments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among them is Vronsky, attended by a Trainer who is fussing over Frou- Frou's bridle and calming her. Vronsky looks with interest at a big power- ful horse which must be Gladiator, with Captain Makhotin already in the saddle. Makhotin and Vronsky greet each other with a nod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- arrives at the races . . . making his way towards the front, smiling, raising his hat to acquaintances . . . his eyes busy looking for his wife. He reaches the front and looks up at the Ladies' Stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME-- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna and Betsy are here, and, not far away, so are Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina: the mother is a fading fortyish; the daughter is eighteen, blonde and pretty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen, who also may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section. Soldiers, Horse People and Locals watch from the turf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A race is flowing towards the winning post, with accompanying crowd reac- tion, but it is clear from Anna's detachment, exchanging chat with Betsy, that this is not Vronsky's race.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--looks up to the ladies' stand. Betsy smiles at him in greeting, but Anna seems unaware.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Countess Vronsky appraises the young princess.
</DIRECTION>
<COUNTESS_VRONSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be the spoil of victory today . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNTESS_VRONSKY>
<DIRECTION>
The young princess smiles at her. Countess Vronsky turns her glasses towards the Starting Post.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEAR THE STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
. . . Vronsky mounts Frou-Frou. The Riders move to the starting line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
. . . watches Anna who is looking through her glasses towards the Starting Post while the current race finishes to cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN, SMILING AROUND, WATCHES AS:--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red cross sewn on it) . . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karenin mounts the steps of the aisle, raising his hat to ladies he knows. Anna ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the wooden boards below, where gentlemen are watching, Oblonsky calls up to Betsy.
</DIRECTION>
<OBLONSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Princess! A bet! What do you fancy in the next?

(TO ANNA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexander Vronsky . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETSY>
<DIRECTION>
In the aisle at the top of the stand, Karenin watches as:--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky's brother Alexander, escorting his wife, Varya, bows to Anna and Betsy, but significantly Varya succeeds in not noticing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The riders line up . . . and they're off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRONSKY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses on either side. His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with Gladiator half a length in front. The next fence is coming up. Gladiator and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in front collectively react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN SEES THAT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna reacts not at all. Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on Vronsky. Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on Anna. When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRONSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator. The horses take the next jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LADIES' STAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one hand Anna grips her folded fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karenin's face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously half-destroying it. She raises her glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA'S POV THROUGH GLASSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a length behind, on the near side to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRONSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just as Frou-Frou takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA'S POV (THROUGH GLASSES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises. Frou-Frou disappears. Gladiator clears the fence in Anna's foreground. Simultaneously, there are shrieks and exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and Vronsky on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COUNTESS VRONSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--looks shocked. Almost in the same moment he hears Anna's anguished cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexei . . . !
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
This is adroit. He comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm, but Anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna ignores him, puts her glasses to her eyes, searching out Vronsky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE COURSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and, in terrible recrimina- tion, tries to pull Frou-Frou to her feet by the reins. Frou-Frou struggles to get up but her back is broken. Officials, officers, and a doctor have come running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
. . . sees an Officer hurrying to the Imperial party to report.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stiva! What are they saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<OBLONSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBLONSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Anna relapses into sobs, attempting to hide her face behind her destroyed fan. Betsy gives Anna her fan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRONSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--is restrained by an Officer.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her back's broken!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer takes a pistol from his holster. Vronsky, enraged and in grief, takes the pistol from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARENIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--persists with Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm asking you . . . if you wish to go . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
He touches Anna's arm. She jerks it away.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, leave me alone.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well and I want her to come with me.

</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
A gunshot is heard from the course. Anna turns her tear-streaked face towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVING COACH--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's hysteria has solidified into a blank despair. Karenin seems to want to pretend that nothing important has happened.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know . . . they say the Emperor dis- approves of the races . . . the danger of injury . . . but I . . .

She has raised her voice. He raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the communication window behind the coachman's box.
</DIRECTION>
<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell. Your conduct was improper. It must not occur again. I have said it before.

Anna smiles faintly. He is misled by that.

Anna looks at him despairingly.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Karenin is literally winded--gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath- ing under control. Anna huddles away from him in her corner. Karenin recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still, looking at nothing, not moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against Anna. He recoils as if from a contamination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coach slows. The coach stops. A Servant comes to the coach door, opens the door.

<KARENIN>

	Wait, please. Move away.

Anna comes to Vronsky. She is still shaken by the showdown with Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his fall.

	Are you hurt?

Vronsky shakes his head. He is moved by the sight of her, full of love and desire, but in her embrace he detects something new, a nervous exaltation.

A prospect: next to a country road, a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER--Levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration. His place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort. Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone. Levin attracts a few grins and comments.

A fire has been lit. The Mowers eat their meal in the company of women. Serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight. Levin watches her discreetly.

EXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night under the stars. Some of the men have gone, some have settled in for the night. The cooking fire is burning out. Levin remains where he was, watching, thinking: drawn to "the simple life."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levin wakes . . . woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levin sees a coach coming towards him. The coach comes nearer, leather boxes strapped to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window, holding on to the white ribbons of her bonnet. He sees that it is Kitty, on her way to Ergoshovo. (Princess Shcherbatsky is also inside, dozing.)

The coach passes on, leaving Levin lovelorn, the dawn light on him. The sight of Kitty has turned him round again.

Vronsky stands at the entrance to the platform holding a bouquet, waiting for a train. He looks pretty fed up.

INT. "FRENCH THEATRE," ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before, the set-up is a small stage, a small auditorium, and an area for drinking, cruising, etc., a combination of music hall and a bar with a few tables. Vronsky is here as the escort of a Foreign Prince (an Indian), watch- ing a "risqué" show with Can-Can Girls, much relished by the visitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky's glance casts about in the gloom. The champagne is flowing. Vron- sky spots a trio--Lisa Merkalova, Betsy, and Stremov, a politician and Karenin's rival.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky catches Betsy's eye. She beckons him. He excuses himself to the Foreign Prince, who doesn't notice, and goes over to the other table. Under the music, he is introduced to Stremov, and kisses the hands of the women. He takes the empty chair.
</DIRECTION>
<VRONSKY>

	He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust- ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cab brings Vronsky. The Karenin coach is waiting outside. As Vronsky approaches the door, it opens and Kapitonich comes out with a folded rug. Kapitonich is wrong-footed by seeing him. Karenin comes out of the door, into the gaslight. When he sees Vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con- tinues. Kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach. Vronsky bows, Karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the rug. Vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off.

INT. COMMITTEE CHAMBER, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT

"The Committee" is in session. Stremov has the floor. He is referring to a map of Russia on an easel, splotched with colours. Karenin is there but not listening, his thoughts far away.

INT. ANNA'S BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karenin walks in and goes to her bureau, empties out little drawers and receptacles, looking for the key to the main drawer. Anna comes in from the bedroom, alarmed, in her nightdress.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to see him because . . .

<KARENIN>

He pulls furiously at the locked drawer, then looks around for an implement.

<KARENIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</KARENIN>
<DIRECTION>
Karenin finds an iron bootjack. Anna tries to stop him. He pushes her aside and smashes the wood around the lock, then, struggling against her, he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box, a good guess. He confirms that it contains letters.

Karenin remains cool.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An impure love is not love, to me. To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise we might as well be cattle.

	You would be lost. Irretrievably lost. You would have no position. And worse if we divorce. You would be the guilty party. That means you cannot legally remarry.

<KARENIN>

Early morning. In a big untidy bed, Vronsky and Anna lie asleep, naked and satiated.

Before the performance, the stairs, galleries and corridors, giving access to the stalls and boxes, are crowded with the town's highest society. And Anna, at her most beautiful, is magically cleaving through it. Awareness of her presence is like a contagion, and yet everyone manages not to catch her eye . . . so while all around her there are people impeding each other with greetings, Anna's path opens before her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She knows what is happening. It shocks her but her eyes barely show it. The spell is broken by Princess Myagkaya (she of the 85 kopek sauce) who hails her.

Then Dolly enters the tea shop. Anna's heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her, but then realises that Dolly is one of a trio of "society ladies," and Anna lowers her head. When she sneaks a look, she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others. Anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger, and is notorious.

</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is listening for Vronsky's return. She hears him come in. She hears him approach. Then she hears Annushka's voice, then Vronsky's voice. She waits in suspense, disappointed as Vronsky's steps retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDY, HOTEL SUITE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna, holding a candle-lamp, finds Vronsky asleep on the couch. She hesi- tates, but turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna wakes. She re-collects herself. She looks at the bedside clock. In a sud- den hurry she leaves the bed and the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna finds Annushka waiting.

</ANNUSHKA>

Anna collapses on a chair and weeps.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died. Do you remember?

INT. CLOSE (HOTEL)--DAY

<DIRECTION>
Anna's hand writes in a hurry: "I'm to blame. Come home. I'm frightened."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna seals the note and gives it to Annushka.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Michael to hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Annushka runs out with the note.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL SUITE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna is keeping watch at the window . . . and is rewarded by the return- ing coach. She hurries out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS, HOTEL--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks down into the entrance hall. Michael, the Coachman, comes in and comes up the stairs to her. She sees that he is holding her note.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the Countess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCAL TRAIN--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks about her. Across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the windows of the other train "going by" . . . seeing the pas- sengers inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's body jerks involuntarily. She half rises. The image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. The win- dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she has the same illusion again-- a "Vronsky" and a "Sorokina" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro- jected film-frames, and she sees "Vronskys" and "Sorokinas" flashing by at gathering speed. And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna collapses into the nearest seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOCAL STATION, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train arrives at a small station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna steps down from the train. The platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. There is an energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement. Porters shout for custom. A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her, but they pass by, ignoring her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive livery, a cockade in his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<COACHMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waiting FOR HIM--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COACHMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna turns back, agitated, expecting Vronsky to appear, but what comes is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her, aware that some are staring at her as she passes. A Boy selling drinks grins at her. A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. She increases her pace. She hurries away towards the far end of the platform. Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. Between her and the train, two Maidservants are walking towards her. They turn their heads to look at her, remarking on her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<MAIDSERVANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that lace on her . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAIDSERVANT>
<DIRECTION>
There is a rough bench near the end of the platform. Anna reaches it and sits down. The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile. The goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her. The two girls stop and watch, vaguely puzzled by her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train, disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons.

EXT. (POKROVSKOE)--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scythe cuts a swathe through standing hay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAYFIELD, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's nearly the last of the hay. The scythe is being swung by Theodore, known from last year. He is one of a dozen Mowers. Levin is among them, wielding his scythe. They have almost reached the end of the field, where the last of the hay is being pitchforked up on to the last piled cart. Theodore's daughter-in-law, now visibly pregnant, is still adept with a pitchfork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a lowering thundery day at the end of summer.
</DIRECTION>

	Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEODORE>
<LEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My soul! What's that? I know what my belly is. How do we know what's rightly? I believe in reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEVIN>
<THEODORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reason? And was it reason that made you chose a wife?

<THEODORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic--that's what's rightly about it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEODORE>
<DIRECTION>
This stops Levin's scythe. He is illumined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Theodore swings the scythe again. Levin walks away, gives his scythe to a Labourer by the cart, and keeps walking. He quickens his pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POKROVSKOE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first drops of rain, few and heavy, arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE AND PORCH, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cries of alarm and laughter burst from a Mushrooming Party approaching the house. Children run ahead, the adults walk faster, then run, helping with baby carriages and picking up small children and baskets of mush- rooms . . . urged on from the porch by Agafia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levin, coming from the hay field, joins the rout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grown-ups are: Levin, Oblonsky, Dolly, the Oblonsky Nurse, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children are: Tanya, Grisha, Masha, Lili and Vasili. Dolly carries her youngest. The children are eighteen months older than when we first saw them.

</AGAFIA>
<DIRECTION>
It is evident from her tone that Kitty and Agafia have made it up long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NURSERY, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain on the window and on the roof. The rain is so loud that it is the foreground sound in the scene; and the dialogue, while we can pick it out without difficulty, is the background sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levin enters, wet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dmitri (Mitya), two months old, is lying on his back in a basin, supported by Kitty's palm under his head. Kitty squeezes a sponge over his body, which he likes.
</DIRECTION>
<LEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came looking for you . . . I understood something . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEVIN>
<KITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kitty lifts Mitya onto a towel on her lap, wraps him and gives him to Levin, who is enchanted by him.
</DIRECTION>

But the baby starts to yell for the breast. Kitty starts to undo her blouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levin shakes his head: he'll tell her some other time, or maybe not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORCH, POKROVSKOE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm has passed. Everything drips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oblonsky comes from inside and lights a cigar. Indistinctly seen and heard through the window, the Mushrooming Party occupies the dining room. Oblonsky smokes thoughtfully, melancholy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FLOWERING MEADOW--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPRINGTIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baby Anya, old enough to stagger on her feet, wavers through wild flowers half her height. She falls over, almost disappearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is being watched, with a mixture more pleasure than pain, by Kar- enin. He is in early retirement, sitting with a book in a garden seat, dressed comfortably under a straw hat. There is the SOUND OVER of people playing croquet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serozha, aged ten, enters his view, going to Anya to haul her upright, and keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on. Karenin's pleasure increases slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER this, the growing SOUND of a battlefield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTLEFIELD (BALKANS)--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vronsky, in an unfamiliar uniform, sabre pointing forward, is mounted at full gallop with the SOUND of the charge all around him in the smoke and noise of guns. Something heavy and invisible with its own SOUND--like the flap of an awning--takes him from his horse into the air and gone, leaving spouts of blood poised for an instant in the smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FLOWERING MEADOW, AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATURAL SOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serozha picks up Anya like a parcel under his arm and walks on with her towards the indistinct figures of Croquet Players strolling in the heat haze, a couple of parasols held aloft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
