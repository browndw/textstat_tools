EXT. BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the exact same position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's expression.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look so peaceful from up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND coming from his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm. It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U".
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like Roxanne's in trouble again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and wonder - now home to a great evil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM- SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI. The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board, is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it: we're all supposed to be "masterminds" - very clever. I just feel stupid. I mean, what the hell did Einstein really do anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theory of relativity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right shoulder and turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with his metal gauntlet.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The real Einstein once said, "God does not play dice with the world." He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DA_VINCI_PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir! Yes, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI_PLATO>
<EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping for air)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DA_VINCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. She fell into our trap just like you knew she would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his posture and sucks in his gut.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, let's not keep the lady waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away from us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo the blindfold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master Mind.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't need to turn around like that. I can recognize the stench of failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like a real group of winners. At the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way, I already have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We go through this every time. You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about my revenge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can say it was wasting everyone's time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. What makes you think I would want to be your queen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it!?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in. He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the observatory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see the observatory shrinking in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero intently searches his hideout.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(on monitor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Master Mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here, old friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, miss your old jail cell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping Metro City's protector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't possibly believe this will work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED BUTTON on it.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, can't I? I have attained control of the Earth's most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTER SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the burning star's power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory.
</DIRECTION>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're now at minimum safe distance, master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent. Stop here, I like this view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty seconds until impact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any last words?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes: there's no caging the power of justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten seconds to impact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.
</DIRECTION>
<PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.
</DIRECTION>
<PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as leverage.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(straining)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold...on...a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.
</DIRECTION>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SON OF A BITCH!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DA_VINCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he just say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six......Five...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind begins to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of trick is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you don't know. These bars are made of copper, aren't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<UBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You figured out my weakness, damn you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UBERMAN>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your weakness is copper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two...one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTER SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window. Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out toward the observatory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think even he could have survived that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Is it me or did you just finally destroy Uberman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(carefully skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...let's not get ahead of ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DA_VINCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, there's something in the sky, coming this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uberman!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind turns toward the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A CAPPED FIGURE.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S GONNA RAM US!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HOLY SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the body.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uberman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered black cape with the yellow "U" on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as she FAINTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just walked on water.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a complete loss.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I know you always wanted to. I mean, all the schemes all the plots - I never thought you'd actually be capable of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is history. Every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually EVER happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden realization comes over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good lord...You do all realize what we get to do now, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind and the others.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We get to go on a crime wave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARMORED TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally.
</DIRECTION>

METRO CITY BANK

<DIRECTION>
Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding BAGS OF MONEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the driver's wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPINNING HEADLINE: "MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VICIOUS TORNADO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the lackeys coolly look on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of CASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(absentmindedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the button marked "Tornado Off."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it melancholy?
</DIRECTION>

It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING BALL.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball, following it with his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth looks over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, do something like that - but center it more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>

She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.

<HAL>

	Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin' REAL good.

Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts in a VCR.

A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair of shoes.

As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.

Disgusted, she walks off screen.

Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.

Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the angle of the camera, I can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't think you've thought this through. If you fire me, who's gonna be captain of the alley's bowling team?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<VINNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody who can actually bowl. You guys have never won a game. I hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit.

The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle of a busy news day.
</DIRECTION>

Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are SHOUTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room to see every eye on her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...um...It's good to be back. Thanks for everyone's cards and concerns. I really appreciated it - now I'm ready to climb back on the horse.

</ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting to make her uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.

<DIRECTION>
Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad expressions on everybody's face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to face him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work.

There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story.
	</DIALOGUE>

There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if she's failed to convince even herself of this.

A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely futuristic machinery.

The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET LAIR.

In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads "Reactor - Don't Touch."

	When I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you.

</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, I know, but please forgive my impertinence. It's just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession. You've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman specials.

<DIRECTION>
Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic beat...
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>

He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S FATHER.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil. And, I have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro City's champion. I tell you, I've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. I thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. But now that I've pretty much accomplished both, I am at a loss.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more important to you than you thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...What's the second part?

</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi.

	YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger. If that's not love, I don't know what is. It's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well. Don't you see? She's the one treasure that's always escaped you.

	Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think remember something from that one - Let's see: "My head is screaming `I want you and need you' - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, I'm alone once again." Wow, I scare even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just really into poetry. Probably because I'm so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself. But enough about me. Can I fill you up?

A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row of garbage cans.

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a minefield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair. The room begins to swim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.
</DIRECTION>
<CAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't look so good, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAT>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel good. I was struck by freaking lightening.

</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst hangover in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not really sure what he's looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. It's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes the thought from his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAL'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content look washes over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and SPLINTERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM SMASHING THE TOILET.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY

Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop.

Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls back to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso right below the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>

Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.

<HAL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, fast, fast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone has returned to a clothed state.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's floating a foot off the ground.

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master Mind.

He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart.

</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look over a "KARATE KID" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.

He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a young Ralph Macchio to kick.

We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He appears to be lying on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lays his head back down.

Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up and down.

	Strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle. Remember, both need to be exercised.

Roxanne smiles at his analogy.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>

There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips.

<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster.

Paul cocks his gun.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's my turn.

EXT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television reporters, including Roxanne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first news conference with great anxiety.
</DIRECTION>
<BANK_MANAGER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I...can't except this. Law and order is it's own...um...reward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering around the crowd to get closer to Titan.

	Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I was just trying to -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<BRAD_HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were "just trying to do." Besides, I heard you couldn't take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail?

<DIRECTION>
Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the camera off.

We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner of the screen is written: "recorded earlier."
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For months now, since the death of Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero. Well, it appears they won't have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene. Today, at the Metro Savings and Trust, a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just who is this new caped avenger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure all of our viewers are now wondering, what's the "T" stand for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_HELMS>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is "Tighten!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
Another reporter leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you spell that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a NEWSPAPER.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't believe it. He misspelled his name.

Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads "Metro's New Hero: Tighten."

<MASTER_MIND>

Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.

Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just fail to see the point in all of this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to...to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EINSTEIN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dare?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and I'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie.

</EINSTEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to Master Mind for his rebuttal.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What - did - you - call me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<EINSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me. You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. You're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.

	THAT is none of your business, knave!

With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of Master Mind's grip.
</DIRECTION>

Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the floor.

He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.

John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing what she's talking about.
</DIRECTION>

He reaches across the table and takes her hand.

	You can't blame yourself. My father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Was he an actor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<JOHN_CUSACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...No. He was...a landscaper. And a horrible one. I mean he would fail time and time again at his...landscaping. And sometimes he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail -

<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jail?

</ROXANNE>
<JOHN_CUSACK>

	Was he ever successful?

It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.

They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John Cusack's disguise generator to short.

His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.

Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.

LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.

As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_CUSACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, never mind that. Now, where were we?

Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face, causing the generator to short out permanently.

Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.

(mumbling to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, it's his fault. He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I'll filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought

Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment window's reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>

	I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I'm sorry I blew up your ex.

(realizing the absurdity of his words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? I'm a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny!

Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store in a cloud of SMOKE.

Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly behind him.

Finally it occurs to her what's going on.

<ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a minute...all that stuff you use to say to me when Uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over Metro City. That wasn't just super villain rhetoric, was it? You actually meant it!

</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>

	My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves.

(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really think I would be with someone like you?
	</DIALOGUE>

This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful conclusion.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne with a baffled expression on her face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected.

	You mean?

A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we see a large window directly behind her.

As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and begins ogling the girl.

She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a robe.

Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.

In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.

Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.

It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly excited.

	Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge?

Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his guest.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-You got to thinking? There's nothing to think about. I'm the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me.

</TITAN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From all over. You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I figured I'd go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself: "Okay,then what?" I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what about your mentor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. Now you've always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. And that brings me to what I wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if I'm by your side?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan awe-struck.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da Vinci.
</DIRECTION>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand it. He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. I'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't be easy. Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was easily used against him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's DNA - copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: "If something works don't dick with it."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only building left untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into the bottom of his beer glass for answers.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can have anything I want. I'm like a god.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a dirty rag.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Point to any woman in this bar. I could have her in a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Old Barfly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you wanna get with this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, what do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Titan carefully considers this for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want? That's the question, isn't it. I mean, what do you want when you can have everything? I suppose what I really want is to never be forgotten again. I want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped. I want a - what's it called? - A legacy. I want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I like the sound that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant, what do you want to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

EXT. BAR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of money.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your time has come to an end, Titan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I should leave town then, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a better idea - NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but can't.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's copper my good man. Your one weakness. For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They watch Titan shrink into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not as dumb as I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not...Funny, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<PLATO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLATO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, something catches his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.
</DIRECTION>
<HAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Legacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a COMMOTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL from the top of the establishment.
</DIRECTION>
<VINNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, that's my ball!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINNIE>

INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a close one. Sixth floor, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the floor unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to adjust her vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks to be some kind of JOURNAL.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's personal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the diary over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you knock me out and tie me to a chair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TELEVISION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_HELMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's chaos here in city square as city police -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_HELMS>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's really out of control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at Master Mind.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have known. You have something to do with this, don't you? - With Titan turning evil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're talking like you made him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they call me Master Mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight. You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. That's pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In hindsight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And his powers, they're just like Uberman's. Why would he have his powers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<MASTER_MIND>
<DIRECTION>
(almost ashamed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had some left over from something. I infused him with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU DID WHAT!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROXANNE>
<DIRECTION>
Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure hatred.
</DIRECTION>
<MASTER_MIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASTER_MIND>
<ROXANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did all this because you wanted purpose?

<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With my new found power, I've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didn't "purposely" save them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete shape just off camera.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITAN>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING BALL from Kingpin's.
</DIRECTION>
<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling.

He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS. We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN FORMATION.

<TITAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them.

	A HYDROGEN reactor?

Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.

He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand.

INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT

The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor.

Master Mind enters.

Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic crypt.

Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic BOOKCASE.

On the twelfth bong it falls silent.

Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud CLICK.

Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls.

He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.

He opens the door to his immediate amazement.

It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.
</DIRECTION>

Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.

Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive guns.

Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each barrel.
