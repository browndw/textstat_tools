Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids?

He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him.

But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor...

Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they will not be deprived of hope...

	Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended for you to be rich he'd have taken care of that a long time ago. The idea of you being rich... that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a fact?

The crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises his hands to wave to the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see various shots of people straining to get a little closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then turns and goes back into the room.

	Attention, please. Attention, please. This is a special announcement from Willie Stark to you people out there. He doesn't want any one of you to leave...

The camera moves over the faces of the people listening.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants you to stay in front of this state Capitol until the fight is over. If you want Willie Stark to win, stay where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. State Capitol, Night

Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. The crowd, every bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still as the announcer's voice is heard again.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention, please. Attention, please. The balloting on the impeachment proceedings against Governor Stark has just ended. This is the result: Willie Stark has won.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers. Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all. Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed crowd.

<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They tried to ruin me. But they are ruined. They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you like what I have done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Loud applause, and cries of "yes."
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, it's not I who have won, but you. Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and I shall live in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him. I'll break him with my bare hands. For I have the strength of many.

</WILLIE>

Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack and comes down the steps to greet him.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're here. I knew you'd come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, forcing them back.

Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anne, Anne... Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and catches hold of her arm.

<ANNE>

	I don't know. Leave me alone.

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that Adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don't you see that? Look at those people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at Willie.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at them! They still believe in him. And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything... anything.

A policeman approaches.

She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking down at Willie.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could have been the whole world, Willie Stark. The whole world... Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me... Willie Stark? Why?

His head droops to the side and he dies.
