EXT. NEW YORK STREETS--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EMS "bus" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights flashing, siren whoop-whooping, swooping through Stygian canyons of New York.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK PIERCE, 28, drives. He wears dark cargo pants, black boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, "EMS" gold logo on one collar, "OLM" on the other. "Our Lady of Mercy Paramedic" is inscribed in white across the back of his navy jacket. On his belt: two-way radio, leather gloves, beeper, drug kit, multi-purpose tool kit, mini-flashlight, collapsible baton.

<DIRECTION>
LARRY, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie (shotgun), both hands clutching the dash.

Frank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. He is a young man of slight frame and open face--his life, his possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes, beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons.
</DIRECTION>

Dispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: "Ladder 4, respond to a 10-22, four flight residential, 417 East 32. 13 Boy, men's room Grand Central, man set his pants on fire. Bad burns. 17 David, at 177 East 24, there's a woman who says a roach crawled in her ear. Can't get it out, says she's going into cardiac arrest ..."

	Thursday started out with a bang: a gunshot to the chest on a drug deal gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight-- all the elements in place for a long weekend. I was good at my job: there were periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me and my mind worked with a cool authority I had never known. But in the last year I had started to lose that control. Things had turned bad. I hadn't saved anyone for months. I just needed a few slow nights, a week without tragedy followed by a couple of days off.

JOHN BURKE, 30, grabs Franks arm:

	We were just watching TV and Dad yelled out and started punching his chest, next thing he locked himself in the bathroom. I said we were gonna call you guys and he said not to. He was crying, I never heard him crying before, then he sorta stopped. We pulled him out and put him on the bed.

They shock him again. This time the body moves less. Frank glances up: Mr. and Mrs. Burke's wedding photo sits on the nightstand. Other pictures: a day at the beach, a young serviceman, happy parents. Frank's mind drifts:

	In the last year I had come to believe in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back, spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them.

John exits. Frank notices Mary for the first time: blond hair dyed black, cut short, loose fitting tank dress, black makeup running down her cheeks. He notices her prom picture, glances back to Mary: it seems she hasn't smiled since that day eight years before. Something special about her, that something that hits you right away.

"September of My Years" plays from the other room. Frank continues massaging Mr. Burke's chest (now to Sinatra beat), even though it's hopeless. Larry returns:

ER: a white-lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with old framed Playbills. Four rows of six plastic chairs face a TV bolted and chained to the ceiling. The seats are filled with backed-up drunks, assault victims and "regulars," bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor, getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and have a smoke.

Larry and Frank wheeling Burke in, two IV lines, each connected to an elbow, tangled in EKG cables. Two LACERATED RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS, the large black sunglassed security guard. He looks up from his television guide:

Walls pushes Noel into unit one. Frank looks over to unit three--Burke's cubicle is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Burke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<HAZMAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZMAT>

Frank nods, walks out. Behind, Walls helps Hazmat and Crupp place Noel on a bed.

INT. ROOM 212--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank Pierce walks down the hospital corridor, steps into room 212.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke lies, tubed, wired and tied to life support. Blue light comes through the window. On the EKG monitor: a slow steady green endless line: up, down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank takes a moment, exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, Frank flips off the machines. The clanging EKG ALARM is followed by the bass honking of the respirator alarm and two tweetering IV-drip alarms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, holding Burke's pulse, watches the life go out of him. Hearing commotion outside, Frank flips the machines back on: the EKG monitor is flatline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLOOR NURSE rushes in, feels for Burke's pulse.
</DIRECTION>
<FLOOR_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Code!

Frank steps back as the Nurse hits the emergency switch.

Dr. Hazmat, out of breath, enters:
</DIRECTION>
<FLOOR_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He coded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOOR_NURSE>
<HAZMAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, what a way to start the day. He's in V-fib. Shock him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZMAT>
<DIRECTION>
Frank pulls out the paddles, applies them to Burke's chest:
</DIRECTION>
<FLOOR_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOOR_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, knowing it's futile, shocks Burke: no result.
</DIRECTION>
<HAZMAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zap him again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZMAT>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes through the motions, pretending to shock Burke. The flatline doesn't waver.
</DIRECTION>
<HAZMAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Get the cart, start compressions, get an epinephrine in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAZMAT>
<DIRECTION>
Frank backs out the door as a nurse and intern enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corridor Frank listens as the activity becomes less urgent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hazmat steps out:

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough. I called it. Let's get some coffee.

EXT. MERCY EMERGENCY--DAYBREAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks out of Our Lady of Mercy, heads down the side street. He passes Tom Walls wielding a giant flashlight, smashing Sixteen XRay's headlights, denting the hood and side windows.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLS>

EXT. MARY'S APT. BUILDING--DAY

Frank rings the buzzer. Mary, sleepy-voiced, answers:
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>

INT. FIRST FLOOR--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary, wearing a burgundy robe, opens the door. Frank says nothing. Her expression darkens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at her again: it's not Mary, it's Rose. Mary has Rose's face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<ROSE_MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can that be? He was getting better.

<FRANK>

INT. MARY'S BEDROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose is Mary again: she and Frank lie clothed on her bed. He leans his head against her breast as she holds him. His eyes close: sleep.

THE END
