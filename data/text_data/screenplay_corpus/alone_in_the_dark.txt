EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dense forest on a dark, misty night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG EDWARD CARNBY (age 10), small, thin, and terrified, runs for his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The forest is pitch black. Young Edward ducks between trees, under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. CREATURE: Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something bright. Edward runs towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running towards the bright light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. CREATURE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: 20 YEARS AGO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the dark forest. A dozen uniformed DEPUTIES move through the forest, shining their flashlights around, searching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trees tower over them. A low fog hangs in the air. The flashlight beams can barely penetrate it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. A small, dense forest stretches out behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign on the front reads: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL LIGHT ORPHANAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several patrol cars are parked along the Orphanage's gravel driveway. DEPUTIES mill around the front lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another patrol car pulls up. Out of it steps the SHERIFF (late 40s). DEPUTY ADAMS (mid-30s) approaches him.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DEPUTY_ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
SISTER CLARA (mid-40s), an anxious-looking nun, stands on the front porch, wrapped in a shawl. She speaks with two DEPUTIES. The Sheriff walks up and listens in.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER_CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After the power went out, I went to check on the children. But their beds were empty. Every one of them. They just disappeared...

EXT. FOREST - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights. The trees are close together, blocking out the moonlight. A thick mist hangs in the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Deputy Adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright light streaming through the trees up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deputy Adams comes through the trees and emerges into a clearing in the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a Shed in the clearing up ahead. A bright light is posted over the Shed's front entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER Deputy Adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the Shed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees that the door is open just a crack. On the door is a sign marked: DANGER, along with the symbol for ELECTRICITY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deputy Adams enters the Shed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power cables, and various implements for repairing power lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deputy Adams sweeps through the Shed with his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches a large transformer module that sits at the back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a LOW SHUFFLING sound. Deputy Adams stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully peers around behind the transformer. The space is too small for a full-size person.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young Edward. He clutches himself, shivering, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORPHANAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff stands with his Deputies. His walkie-talkie CRACKLES to life.
</DIRECTION>

<CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, maybe you're thinking I'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. But that's where you're wrong. Because I've got my reasons. There's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see. You've willfully closed your eyes. But your fear of the dark is not a weakness. It's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see. My eyes were forced open a long time ago. Now I know. Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row. The taxi shifts into gear and drives off.

The CABBIE (late 20s), manic bordering on crazy, steers through traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby rides in the backseat. He looks out the back windshield. A few cars back, Pinkerton's taxi follows them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench-coat pocket. Inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic-looking head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The edges are soft, worn-down, the detail roughed away. But it is clearly not a human face.

EXT. CITY STREETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby's taxi accelerates down the street, pulling away from Pinkerton's taxi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as it's evident that they are on to him, Pinkerton's taxi speeds up to give chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two taxis rocket down the streets, swerving past cars, SCREECHING around corners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby's taxi speeds down the streets, narrowly avoiding collisions with other cars and PEDESTRIANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton just plows through whatever's in his way, SMASHING past other cars, forcing Pedestrians to jump out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton accelerates and tries to force Carnby's taxi off the road. The taxi's GRIND against one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby's taxi SCREECHES around a corner, speeding into a side street that leads to the Market Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARKET STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A busy street crowded with PEDESTRIANS, open shops, and produce stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby's taxi races down the busy Market Street, followed by Pinkerton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They swerve and SCREECH down the Street, cutting off other cars, and narrowly avoiding Pedestrians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then Pinkerton's taxi ZOOMS up beside Carnby's taxi and BUMPS into it with a GRINDING CRUSH of metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not stopping, Pinkerton's taxi continues to GRIND into Carnby's taxi. The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around sideways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a parked car with a CRUSH of metal and SHATTERING glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure, exchange a look. Pinkerton's expression is fierce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to smash into Carnby's taxi again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. His face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. The Cabbie struggles to get loose.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CABBIE>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll draw him away...

</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
As Pinkerton's taxi backs up, it CRASHES into a Van driving by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents of the Van onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract himself from the crushed taxi. He wrenches himself out the window, just in time to see Pinkerton's taxi accelerating towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped Cabbie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for the running Carnby. Pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby leaps out of the way as Pinkerton's taxi CRASHES into the side of a Building, narrowly missing him. Pinkerton's taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the air with superhuman force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING into him with a tremendous impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton CRASHING through the front window of a Bakery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAKERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton comes CRASHING through the display window, landing in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But seemingly unfazed, he just picks himself up and walks back out the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARKET STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby stands in a crowd of BYSTANDERS, watching in surprise as Pinkerton exits the Bakery, his expression fierce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton immediately spots Carnby and comes after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby bolts away, running into a Herbalist Store across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HERBALIST STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jars of different shapes and sizes containing a variety of medicinal herbs and other such substances are on display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby runs into the Herbalist Store, making his way through the displays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton leaps right through the Herbalist Store's front display window in a hail of SHATTERED glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tackles Carnby, CRASHING through the jars on display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton SLAMS Carnby to the ground. He grabs Carnby's head and SMASHES it against the floor once, then twice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton tears open Carnby's trench-coat. He pulls out the burlap sack. He opens the sack, confirming the stone carving is inside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Pinkerton inspects the stone carving, Carnby's hand quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby SMASHES the glass jar over Pinkerton's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the stone carving out of Pinkerton's hand, scrambles to his feet, and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby BURSTS out of the Herbalist Store's back door, exiting out into a small, cluttered Alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby lands hard in the debris, but he rolls with the fall and is back up on his feet, running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alley ends in a high Wall with a Billboard on top of it. The Wall has a railing along one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Alley is crowded with WORKERS unloading crates out of the loading dock of the Ice Factory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BEAT COP walks by. Carnby runs past the Beat Cop, just barely bumping into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as Carnby passes him, he deftly grabs the Beat Cop's gun from his holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beat Cop doesn't even notice his gun is missing as he turns, annoyed to see Carnby racing away.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAT_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAT_COP>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton runs out of the Herbalist Store's back door. He runs directly at the high Wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton leaps up, scrambling right up the side of the Wall. He hauls himself up the Billboard, until he's standing at the top of the Billboard itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton looks down below and spots Carnby running into the loading dock of the Ice Factory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton leaps off the Billboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beat Cop looks up, stunned to see Pinkerton leaping towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates, CRUSHING the crates on it. The WORKER pushing the dolly falls back, shocked. Pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing after Carnby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beat Cop fumbles for his gun. It's not there. Pinkerton smashes the Beat Cop out of the way as he pursues Carnby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beat Cop flies into a pile of crates, knocked out. Pinkerton follows Carnby into the Ice Factory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ICE FACTORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The refrigerated Ice Factory is filled with neat rows of ice blocks. FACTORY WORKERS mill about, transporting the blocks of ice through the Factory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks. He checks the Beat Cop's gun to make sure it's loaded. It is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby stops, sensing something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one fluid motion, Carnby suddenly spins, turning in the other direction and FIRING the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the bullet as it rockets through the Ice Factory. It WHIZZES along, until we see Carnby's intended target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton comes through the Ice Factory, running at Carnby. The bullet flies directly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet hits Pinkerton in the shoulder. But it only seems to anger Pinkerton further. He keeps running at Carnby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton leaps at Carnby. Carnby FIRES again. But Pinkerton dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice, SHATTERING it in a hail of ice shards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks of ice blocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby tries to track Pinkerton's movements through the ice stacks. He hears the sound of Pinkerton MOVING, but can't see him. His gun is ready. He searches around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there's a RUSH of movement behind him. Carnby dodges just as Pinkerton's fist comes flying out. Pinkerton connects with an ice block, SHATTERING it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby is backed into a dead end in the Ice Factory. He turns to face Pinkerton, gun ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Pinkerton is on him too quickly. He lunges at Carnby, hoisting him over his head and SLAMMING him down on a conveyer belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick, Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is immediately killed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom, its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols. This is the lynchpin artifact, the piece which connects the other artifacts together.

	Edward, John here. Hope things went well wherever you were this time. And, please, do not, I repeat, do not tell me about it. Every time you tell me about your latest case, I get nightmares for a week. Anyway, give me a call when you get back. Linda wants to have you by for dinner. Lord knows why, but she seems to like you.

Suddenly, Captain Chernick is thrown back by something invisible. He is hoisted into the air. He looks shocked.

Captain Chernick seems to be floating just above the ground, although it is clear something invisible is holding him up.

The First Mate and Crewman Barnes look on, stunned, their revolvers aimed at the floating Captain.

He looks through the peephole in the door. The peephole is dirty, hard to see through. Something frantic is happening outside the door, but it's hard to see exactly what.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is more GUNFIRE and then SCREAMING. Short BURSTS of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE follow, and more SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, all is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens grabs a discarded metal rod and jams it into the door handle, wedging it closed. He backs away from the door. The only weapon he can see is a box-cutter. He grabs it, holding it out in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there's a CRASH at the door. Something pushes at the door, trying to get in. The door RATTLES and THUMPS from the impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens, still holding the box-cutter, strains against the door, using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut. The metal rod wedged against the door is starting to buckle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the door is still. Hudgens waits. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a CRASH as another impact hits the door. The RACKET is even more intense. But the door holds.

Finally, the thrashing stops. All is quiet again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Storage Room stop flickering. They come back on. Hudgens listens, straining to hear anything at all.

Cautious, Hudgens pulls away the metal rod. He gingerly touches the door. With a long CREAK, it slowly swings open. The crowbar was shaken loose from all the impacts.

Tense, carefully looking around, Hudgens walks up to the empty gold container.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of the container.

<DIRECTION>
The outdoor patio of a downtown Restaurant. Carnby sits with a coffee and a cherry pie at a table for two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AGENT PAUL FISCHER (mid-50s), precise but friendly, approaches the table and sits down across from Carnby.
</DIRECTION>
<FISCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did I agree to this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISCHER>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER walks up. He puts down a plate of pecan pie in front of Fischer. The Waiter smiles and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>

Fischer gives Carnby a smirk.
</DIRECTION>
<FISCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a good memory, Carnby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISCHER>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer takes a bite of the pecan pie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer pulls out a file and slides it across the table. Carnby opens the file. Inside it are photos and reports on the three remaining Orphans from Carnby's list.
</DIRECTION>
<FISCHER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I tracked down the three you asked about. They all disappeared last night. Same story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and walked out in the middle of the night.

</FISCHER>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means all nineteen are missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<FISCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ran full cross-references. Nothing much in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage. Your orphanage. What's going on, Carnby?

</FISCHER>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm trying to find out.

<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just...

But Hudgens has already hung up. Aline looks at the receiver, frustrated. She hangs up the phone.

She looks up, tilting her head to hear FOOTSTEPS approaching.

Carnby stands in front of the Security Desk.

	Edward...

</ALINE>
<DIRECTION>
Aline runs up and embraces Carnby. She holds him tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline lets go. They hold eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Aline rears back and PUNCHES Carnby in the face. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby takes the hit, rubbing his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed you too.

<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me one reason why I'd ever want to speak to you again?

Carnby stands with Aline at her desk, while she scans a 3-D rendering of the lynchpin artifact into her computer.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the Amazon for six weeks, tracking poachers through their transport lines. Then I fell in with a group of ex- Chilean military selling artifacts on the black-market. This was found in a gold mine in the southern tip of Chile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how did you end up with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALINE>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked very nicely.

</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Aline looks up at Carnby.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should've called, Edward. Or written. Just to let me know you were alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALINE>
<DIRECTION>
Aline picks up the lynchpin artifact, inspecting it. She runs her fingers over the Abkani symbols carved into it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it make any sense to you?

</CARNBY>
<ALINE>

INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline and Carnby stand at a work station. A piece of cloth covers up something on the work station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline pulls back the cloth, revealing three Abkani artifacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each of the three artifacts is a gold ring, one small and thin, one medium and slightly thicker, and one large. The large ring is shaped like a pyramid with the top cut off and has thin protrusions on its base. Each of the ring artifacts is well-worn from age and engraved with Abkani symbols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline puts the lynchpin artifact down next to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were found in completely different locations. Alaska. Newfoundland. Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALINE>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten thousand years ago, it would've been like burying them at the ends of the earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
Aline picks up the lynchpin artifact again. She runs her fingers over one symbol in particular, carved into the flat top of the artifact: the DARK SPIRIT.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Abkani's written language is based on pictograms. Combinations of symbols to create different meanings. But there's one here I've never seen before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALINE>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Office start to flicker. In unison, the computer monitors all go dark.

Carnby pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care if nothing's wrong with the grid. Something's definitely wrong with our power. Get someone down here, pronto.

<DIRECTION>
The Guard hangs up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a WHOOSH of movement behind him. The Guard turns to the sound. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks on his flashlight, shining the beam into the dark corners of the area. Nothing is there.

<DIRECTION>
Something CLATTERS in another room. The Guard quickly turns to the sound of the movement.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway. Framed art hangs from the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overhead lights in the Hallway emit only a low glow, flickering sporadically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline leads the way with a flashlight. They come up to a door to a second Hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hairs on the back of Carnby's neck rise up. He touches the back of his neck, spooked. Aline notices.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?

</ALINE>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.

Aline gets it.

Carnby pulls out his PARA-METER. It's an old, battered device. The display lights up as Carnby turns it on. The para- meter immediately picks up some readings.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated?

</ALINE>
<CARNBY>

Carnby listens at the door. Carnby nods to Aline as he opens the door. Nothing is there.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM/CERAMICS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard enters the Ceramics Room. The overhead lights give off only low glows, flickering sporadically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard walks through the room, shining his flashlight around. He can't see anything out of the ordinary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHOOSH of movement slips past the Guard. He turns quickly. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shines his flashlight around, looking for anything out of the ordinary. He stands with his back to a display case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the shadows behind the display case, a long, segmented tail emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tail is covered in hard, dark scales. At the end of the tail is a sharp spike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tail suddenly flicks at the Guard, piercing him through the back of the head and out his mouth. The tail's spike glistens with fresh blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard's flashlight CLATTERS to the floor. The bulb BREAKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tail withdraws from the Guard. The Guard's body falls to the ground, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 2
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline leads the way with the flashlight, followed by Carnby. The Hallway is only faintly lit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From up ahead, they hear a CLATTERING sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby reaches into his holster and pulls out his revolver. Aline hands him the flashlight without a word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCENES 66 TO 68 OMITTED

INT. MUSEUM/CERAMICS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline and Carnby quietly come out a service door that leads to the Ceramics Room. They conceal themselves behind a pair of columns, scanning the area before they step out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through the area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline is about to speak, but Carnby puts a finger to his mouth and shakes his head, no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dead body of the Guard lies in a pool of blood on the ground. There seems to be no one else around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a XENOMORPH CREATURE emerges out of the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. It is seven feet tall, covered in thick, dark scales. It stands on two legs, with long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a segmented, spiked tail poised behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its demonic head has black, sunken eyes and a severe jaw lined with jagged, fang-like teeth. The head is identical to the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline look shocked. They freeze, not moving a muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two creatures congregate in the middle of the room. They are the same hulking, grotesque brutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two creatures start to communicate. An unintelligible language passes between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, one of the creatures looks up, sensing something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature looks directly at Carnby and Aline, hiding behind the columns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature delivers a SHARP WHISPER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, the creature fades into invisibility. It has totally disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second creature immediately follows suit, also fading invisible.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we'd better run...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline scramble to their feet and sprint back towards the service door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An invisible creature comes racing after them. All that is visible is the effect of the creature's movement. It knocks over a statue as it chases after them. The statue SMASHES to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline is through the door. Carnby runs through it and Aline pulls it closed behind them.

INT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 2

<DIRECTION>
Aline and Carnby run down the long Hallway, towards a pair of double-doors at the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The service door behind them bursts open. An invisible creature runs down the Hallway towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the invisible creature runs, it knocks framed art off the walls, smashes aside tables and chairs. The creature isn't visible, only the effect of its movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby turns and FIRES his gun at the on-rushing creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But his bullets don't hit anything except the wall on the other side of the Hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby keeps FIRING, still not hitting anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The invisible creature races towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the double-doors at the other end of the Hallway burst open. The second invisible creature starts running towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both directions down the Hallway are now blocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby spots an open door marked STORAGE ROOM. He pushes Aline into it and jumps in after her.

INT. MUSEUM/STORAGE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby leans up against the door, pushing it closed. Aline fumbles for her building keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a CRASH as the creature SLAMS against the other side of the door. Carnby strains to keep it closed. The door RATTLES as the creature CRASHES into it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline finds the right key. She gets it into the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the creature PUNCHES a clawed hand right through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hand is visible as it digs its claws into Aline's arm. The claws cut deep gashes into her. She SCREAMS in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact knocks the key out of the lock. Aline drops the keys as she clutches her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature's arm retracts out the hole in the door. It SMASHES into the door even harder, trying to break through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby strains against the door, trying to keep it closed.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>

	Can't hold it...

There's another CRASH. Carnby and Aline back away from the door. The door starts to buckle from the impacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby reloads his revolver. He has it ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then the CRASHING stops. Aline and Carnby listen. Everything is quiet.

The lights are dim. Moonlight streams in through the skylight above them.

Aline shines the flashlight around. She hears a WHOOSH of movement behind her and shines the flashlight towards it.

The sound of a quickly approaching HELICOPTER can be heard in the distance.

The double-doors BURST open as an invisible creature SMASHES through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It chases after them, knocking everything in its path out of the way
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead of them, the second invisible creature comes CRASHING through the display cases, heading right for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline are trapped between the two invisible creatures. They have nowhere to run.
</DIRECTION>

The sound of a HELICOPTER rises up overhead.

In a hail of shattered glass, AGENTS BARR (male), CHEUNG (female), and MARKO (male) burst through the skylight, rappelling down on zip-lines from the hovering helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They each carry a sleek, high-tech assault rifle with a lamp mounted on the top. They all wear full Bureau 713 combat gear, body armor with a headset comm-link and a helmet with a dark visor mounted on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creatures HISS in reaction and scramble out of the spotlights from the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agents immediately open FIRE. Their bullets glow with a pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All Carnby and Aline can see is the Agents shooting glowing bullets into the unnaturally long shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the SQUEAL of one of the creatures shows that the Agents' bullets have found their target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily flashes visible, then invisible again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agents cut their zip-lines, dropping to the ground.

As they land, they all flip on their rifle-mounted lamps. The bright blue beams cut through the darkness.

Their movements are precise, controlled. They all have their rifles out, scanning the area.

Agent Barr has a high-tech scanning device attached to his rifle. It is an updated version of Carnby's para-meter that monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. It is used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures.

The Lab is full of sleek, high-tech lab equipment and state of the art computers. The room is lit with a HUMMING fluorescent light. Surgical equipment and various pieces of high-tech machinery BUZZ by an autopsy slab. Surgical tools are laid out on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pinkerton's body is laid out on the slab, face-down.

At the other side of the Lab is a large recess in the space. The opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold. The cage appears to be empty.
</DIRECTION>

But suddenly, an invisible creature SLAMS into the bars of the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it, making it visible for a split second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens watches calmly. He goes to a small dial built into the wall beside the cage. Hudgens turns up the dial.

In the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature. It SQUEALS and HISSES from the electricity.

Fischer's wife, SARAH FISCHER (early 50s) stirs the contents of a pot with a wooden spoon. Fischer makes a salad.

Sarah Fischer hurries to the front door.

She checks her appearance in a mirror in the Foyer. She touches her hair, purses her lips, and turns to the door.

She opens the front door, a pleasant expression on her face.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FISCHER'S HOUSE/KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Kitchen start to flicker. Fischer freezes, listening. The House is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer dives for the revolver hanging in his holster on the chair. He pulls a container of glowing bullets out of the pocket of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The container spills on the floor. He scrambles to pick up the bullets and load them into the revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer edges to the Kitchen door, listening, anxious. Everything is quiet.

He quietly pushes open the door, revolver ready.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FISCHER'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer quietly opens the door to the Living Room, gripping his revolver tightly. He steps into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Living Room are out. A broken lamp lies SMASHED on its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer comes around the side of the couch. He stops, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah Fischer's dead body lies in a pool of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer is suddenly grabbed and SLAMMED into the wall. The impact knocks several framed photos of Fischer and his Wife off the wall. They SHATTER as they hit the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer is PUNCHED in the face, hard. He is stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer is hurled over the couch. He lands heavily on a glass coffee table, SHATTERING the glass tabletop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact knocks his revolver out of his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer lies dazed in the broken glass. He looks up at his attacker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Hudgens, standing over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens SLAMS his fist into Fischer's face. Fischer is now only semi-conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal-worm. Its many clawed feet and razor-sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled body writhing in his grip.
</DIRECTION>
<HUDGENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.

Hudgens grabs Fischer by his hair and pulls his head back, forcing his mouth open.
</DIRECTION>
<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the spinal-worm as it enters Fischer's mouth, slipping down his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We continue to follow the spinal-worm as it makes its way through Fischer's body, weaving through the twists and turns of his digestive system and internal organs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spinal-worm tears through layers of Fischer's insides, finally making its way to his spine. The spinal-worm then wraps itself around Fischer's spine, its tiny clawed feet grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move up Fischer's spinal cord to his brain. The spinal- worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts. We travel through Fischer's brain and out of his eyes.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Fischer's expression is now calm. Hudgens regards Fischer, looking pleased with himself.

The small Shed is cluttered with equipment for repairing power lines. A large transformer module sits at the back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something compels Young Edward to move closer towards the transformer and reach out a trembling hand. He places his hand against the transformer's front grill.

INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's night. The Loft is dark. Carnby and Aline are fast asleep on the bed, lying next to one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby wakes up with a start. He tries to get his bearings. Carnby looks surprised to see Aline lying next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quietly gets out of bed, letting her sleep. He pulls on a fresh shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light. He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby unwraps the items. They are the three Abkani artifacts from the Museum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around. Something catches his eye. Carnby fiddles with the artifact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the artifact telescopes out. Instead of one thick ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled on the other, with a common hollow middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby picks up the large ring artifact. He slots it into place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact. Next, Carnby slots in the medium and small rings into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four pieces fit together perfectly, creating a cylindrical device with a small, round opening in the bottom.
</DIRECTION>

</CARNBY>

Carnby takes out the assembled Abkani device and puts it down on the table between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline picks up the device, fascinated. She runs her fingers over the Abkani symbols carved into the lynchpin artifact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to her bag and pulls out the map she was working on and the CD. She hands Carnby the CD.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you run the program on this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALINE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby goes over to his computer and inserts the CD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline spreads out the map. She draws lines across it, connecting up constellations with locations on the map. She writes out latitude and longitude calculations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline comes up to Carnby at the computer. The program is waiting for her calculations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans past Carnby and enters the latitude and longitude numbers into the program. The computer processes the information. Hundreds of map images flash across the screen as the computer searches for a match.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we looking for?

INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby puts the dishes from their meal into the Kitchen sink. The sink tap is RUNNING. Aline clears the dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The para-meter Fischer gave Carnby starts faintly BEEPING, but the RUNNING sink tap covers the sound. Something is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Loft flicker once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby turns off the tap and they listen intently. They can hear the scanner BEEPING faintly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Loft flicker and go out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline grabs the flashlight and switches it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby runs to his revolver and holster. He checks the chamber in his revolver. The bullets glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby looks up, sensing something. He spins around, ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE stands behind him. It is John.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John looks fierce, his face drawn, gaunt. His eyes are sunken into dark recesses, with nearly clear irises.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
John lunges at Carnby. Carnby is too surprised to defend himself. John SLAMS Carnby against the wall, knocking his revolver out of his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John picks Carnby up and hurls him across the Loft. Carnby CRASHES through furniture as he lands heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the shadows behind Aline, two FIGURES emerge. They are both missing ORPHANS, one MALE, one FEMALE. They have the same gaunt faces and clear irises as John.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby picks himself up. He spots the Orphans behind Aline.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNBY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind you!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The two Orphans lunge at Aline, but she's able to dodge out of the way. The Orphans are fast and fierce. Aline leaps forward, sliding across the floor towards Carnby's revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs it and spins to face the two Orphans. They're gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then the Female Orphan leaps out at her. Aline FIRES, hitting the Female Orphan in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Female Orphans jumps away, into the shadows. Aline scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. But the Female Orphans has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline runs over to Carnby. He grabs a shotgun from the weapons cabinet and loads it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That looked like John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALINE>
<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into the darkness of the Loft. They listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, John lunges at him, his teeth bared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby SMASHES John across the head with the shotgun. But John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John skitters off into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her with her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for Aline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male Orphan across the face with the pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see John rising up behind her, about to strike. Carnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct, Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him. The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. The Female Orphan falls back, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline comes up to Carnby. He stands over John's corpse.
</DIRECTION>

</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
The para-meter starts BEEPING again, louder and more frenetic. The lights start to flicker, fading up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby unzips the duffle-bag. It's full of 713 equipment given to him by Fischer. Carnby loads an assault rifle with 713 magazines. He loads a pistol with the glowing bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby throws Aline the pistol. She catches it in mid-air. She checks it like a pro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline and Carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a moment of quiet. They listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the Loft flicker. The scanner BEEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something SMASHES into the Loft's front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby grabs the para-meter. It BEEPS more insistently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door BURSTS open, knocked right off its hinges by the invisible creature crashing through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. CREATURE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The invisible xenomorph creature's skewed, inhuman P.O.V. as it looks across the Loft, searching. It locates Carnby and Aline and heads directly for them. All that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature SMASHES right through a glass-topped work table, SHATTERING it. Papers whirl around in its wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline and Carnby stand their ground, facing the on-coming creature as it lunges towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline leap out of the way at the last moment. Rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously OPEN FIRE. Their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature SQUEALS, flashing visible from the multiple impacts. Their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it tumbles to the ground, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. Broken furniture and shattered glass is everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby's para-meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the creature's death. The lights stop flickering.

Suddenly, all the lights in the Loft go out in unison. All the computer monitors also go dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scanner starts BEEPING frenetically. Electromagnetic readings shoot up, registering multiple sources nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline back up together, ready for an attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the first thing they hear isn't a creature. It's the sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Streaks of glowing bullets fly through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a 713 unit, laying down suppressing FIRE as the Agents enter the Loft through the broken front door.

An invisible creature swoops out of the shadows towards an Agent, who is FIRING in the opposite direction. The creature whips past the Agent, slicing him open with a fluid slash of its claws. The creature keeps moving directly for Carnby.

Carnby and Aline, standing together, FIRE their weapons in the darkness, oblivious to the creature rushing towards them.

<DIRECTION>
Another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall, avoiding the GUNFIRE. It locates its target, an Agent FIRING up at the ceiling. It races towards the Agent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agent turns to the attack and tries to fire. But the creature is too fast. It SLAMS the Agent back against the wall and impales him with its spiked-tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agents Barr and Cheung spot this and OPEN FIRE on the creature. It flails about, fading visible from the impacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature tries to scurry away, but Barr and Cheung are on it. With precision and speed, they blow the creature away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But more creatures attack. The fighting is fierce. Glowing bullets streak through the darkness. The Agents are calm and determined as they engage the creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline hold their own, sticking together, SHOOTING at whatever shadows move around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Six AGENTS in full combat gear burst into the Loft. Leading the unit is Commander Burke. Agent Miles is with him, as is AGENT TURNER (mid-30s).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke, Miles, Turner, and the other Agents immediately join the battle, laying down suppressing FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Agent carrying a rifle-mounted grenade-launcher FIRES an incendiary flash-grenade at the Upper Level of the Loft. With a flash of blinding light, the grenade EXPLODES. Creatures SQUEAL as flames swoop up through the Upper Level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glowing bullets fill the dark Loft. Creatures SQUEAL and flail from the hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness of the Loft, Carnby, Aline, and the Agents finish off the remaining invisible creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. The Agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead.
</DIRECTION>

Agent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them. Barr clearly respects Carnby's abilities.

<DIRECTION>
An Agent standing at the other end of the Loft hears something SHUFFLING behind him. He turns to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something grabs the Agent, SLAMS him back against the wall, and rips out his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and clear irises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure out what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke. Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The Orphan was about to pounce on Burke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another. Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ORPHANS attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage. Like Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast, and deadly. They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with sunken eyes and nearly clear irises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce. They bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw around the Agents and tear them apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark Loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking through the darkness. The Agents' rifle-mounted lamps shine around, but the effect is chaotic, disorienting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Orphans attack, they make quick work of many of the Agents. Glowing bullets fly around everywhere. The SCREAMS of Agents being torn apart mix with BURSTS of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby and Aline stay together, dodging the attacking Orphans, and FIRING into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Orphan rises up behind Carnby. He spins and SHOOTS her in the side. But she just keep coming. Carnby SHOOTS the Orphan again, this time dead center in the chest. The Orphan collapses, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby checks the corpse. The bullet came out the other side. A mixture of red blood and black, sticky ooze drips from a bullet hole right over the Orphan's spine.

Carnby grabs the comm-link off the body of a dead Agent.

With this information, the Agents quickly gain the upper-hand against the Orphans' attack. The Orphans are fast and deadly, but they have no organization. Now that the Agents have a handle on this new threat, their precision and speed returns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon, the battle is over. Dozens of bodies of dead Agents and dead Orphans lie littered around Carnby's destroyed Loft.

Only Carnby, Aline, Burke, Miles, Barr, Cheung, Marko, and Turner remain alive.

The on-rushing creatures SQUEAL and flash visible as the gatling guns cut into them with waves of glowing bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Agent Miles' scanner continues to BEEP frenetically. More and more creatures continue to rush towards them.
</DIRECTION>

<CARNBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aline!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNBY>
<DIRECTION>
With a loud SQUEAL, a SAND WORM bursts out of the sand in front of Aline. At the end of its elongated body, a pair of snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor-sharp teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline scrambles back and falls down. Her rifle is out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another sand worm bursts out of the sand, diving for Carnby. But he is quick on the draw. He SHOOTS the sand worm before it can bite him. The bullets BLOW APART the sand worm's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand on the Chamber floor comes alive with movement as sand worms burrow towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agents Barr and Cheung OPEN FIRE on the sand worms. Aline fumbles for her flashlight, shining it at the sand worm. It recoils from the light and HISSES at her. The sand worm's jaws fold open, revealing its razor-sharp teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand worm tries to dodge the light. It snaps at Aline with its jaws and lunges at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs it by the torso, just under the snapping jaws. The sand worm struggles, trying to bite Aline. She can barely hold it away from her. Her grip starts to loosen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at Aline's face. She strains to hold it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the sound of a GUNSHOT, the sand worm's head explodes. It flops to one side, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sand worm bursts out and chomps down on Cheung's bad foot. She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barr SHOOTS the worm that bit Cheung. Cheung falls back, her body seizing up from its poisonous bite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheung's body contorts. Barr grabs her as Cheung's head reels back and her body goes limp. She's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke turns, his face grim. He OPENS FIRE on the sand worms. With precision and intensity, he FIRES controlled bursts at any movement under the sand.
</DIRECTION>

Carnby FIRES along with him. After a few seconds, the movement has stopped.
</DIRECTION>

A creature leaps out at Agent Miles. He spins and opens FIRE. The creature flashes visible as Miles riddles it with bullets. The creature flails around, dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creatures start leaping out at the Agents, jumping over the Humvee barricades and slashing at Agents with their claws. The Agents STRAFE every creature they see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A creature jumps on an Agent's back and tears at him. Another creature pounces on an Agent, ripping him open.

Fischer approaches Agent Turner and the other Agent standing at the generator. His demeanor is now totally different. He is cold, menacing. Agent Turner turns to see Fischer approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_TURNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fischer?

</AGENT_TURNER>
<DIRECTION>
In a quick motion, Fischer grabs Agent Turner by the throat and hurls him out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Agent FIRES on Fischer with her weapon. Fischer takes a bullet in the shoulder. It doesn't stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer lunges for the Agent. He knocks her back and grabs her face. Fischer snaps the Agent's neck, killing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Turner runs towards Fischer, FIRING a sustained BURST of automatic GUNFIRE. Agent Turner's bullets rip into him, but Fischer keep coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer lunges at Turner, grabbing him and SLAMMING him against the generator. Fischer SMASHES Turner in the face, almost knocking him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer tears open Turner's combat vest. Four grenades hang from the vest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, Fischer pulls the pins out of the four grenades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turner starts to regain consciousness just in time to see this. His eyes go wide in fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fischer hold Turner against the generator. Fischer is too strong for Turner to get away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grenades all EXPLODE. Fischer and Turner are instantly killed.
</DIRECTION>

Miles' scanner registers dozens of signals approaching. Agent Miles OPENS FIRE, sending a stream of glowing bullets at the approaching creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNFIRE rings out all around. Glowing bullets streak through the dark night in all directions. Nearby, an Agent SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>

Agents Miles, Agent Feenstra, and two other AGENTS, are barricaded behind pieces of mining machinery. They SHOOT streams of glowing bullets across the dark Entrance Hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, an invisible creature grabs the first Agent from behind a rusty piece of machinery. The creature throws the Agent into the air. He lands heavily, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before the Agent can get to his feet, three invisible creatures pounce, tearing him to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind his position, Miles SHOOTS at the creatures with glowing bullets, scattering them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second Agent stands behind a piece of machinery, tense, rifle ready. She hears a WHOOSH of movement nearby. She turns, but can't see anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears a SHUFFLING sound above her. She looks up. The creature is above her, on top of the machinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agent tries to SHOOT, but the creature's tail SNAPS at her, impaling her with its tail-spike.

Miles SHOOTS at the creature, emptying his last magazine. But he's too late to save Feenstra. Her torn-up body slumps against their barricade
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Miles is alone. He is out of ammunition. He pulls the trigger futilely. Miles stands firm. He flips up his visor.

Next to the hangar doors is a control panel. Barr pulls the front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barr pulls on the hand-crank. It won't give. Carnby joins him and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank. The hand- crank CLANKS into the open position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old mechanism is engaged. The hangar doors slide open, revealing another doorway behind them. But this one is clearly not part of the Lab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani symbols. The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. It looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door.

In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening. Aline uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door. One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT.

As Hudgens speaks, Carnby, Burke, and Aline exchange a look between them. Carnby's eyes indicate the C-4 in Agent Barr's pack. Burke and Aline understand.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVE Hudgens steps through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorway opens up into a vast Cave, hundreds of feet high and wide, stretching off into darkness. The cave walls are rough-hewn rock, untouched by human hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls of the Cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds of tunnels, pocking the rock like a hive, leading off into the depths of the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens moves into the Cave, tentative, but excited.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there's a SCRATCHING, SCURRYING sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph. And a third.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the vast cave, dozens of xenomorphs creep out of individual tunnels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hudgens steps further into the Cave. The xenomorphs approach him, their heads darting about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The xenomorphs surround Hudgens on all sides. His steps are careful. He reaches his hand out to one of the creatures. T he creature moves up to Hudgens' hand, smelling it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature lunges at him, ripping into him with its teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other xenomorphs surrounding Hudgens pounce on him as well. The creatures tear Hudgens apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a dam breaking, hundreds of xenomorphs start streaming out of the hive-like tunnel system of the Cave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the doorway, Aline sees the creatures coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND LAB

<DIRECTION>
Carnby shoves the hand-crank into the closed position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hangar doors in front of the Abkani doorway start to close. Aline backs away from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline OPENS FIRE with an assault rifle. The glowing bullets streak into the dark Cave, hitting several of the approaching creatures. But there are too many of them. They keep coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hangar doors are almost closed. The xenomorphs are only a few feet from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hangar doors SLAM closed just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy impact THUMPS against the other side of the hangar doors. Then another. The xenomorphs are trying to get though.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke is positioning C-4 charges around the Lab. He wires them all through a remote detonator.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline climbs up the ladder. Carnby climbs up behind her.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke enters the Lab. He closes the sliding door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnby gets to the sliding door just as it's closing. He tries to engage the opening mechanism, but it won't work. Carnby tries to pull it open, but the door's jammed shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aline runs up to Carnby as he tries to pry open the door.

<DIRECTION>
Burke's rifle is jammed into the opening mechanism of the sliding door, blocking it from engaging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hangar doors are warped from the impacts. The gap between the doors is being pulled open by dozens of creatures. The hangar doors start to buckle under the pressure.

	Here's what I know. There are two worlds on this planet. A world of light and a world of darkness. For millions of years, these worlds were in balance. But now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere. The dark places are disappearing. We forced them to come out of the shadows. Now, it's my job to force them back in. My name is Edward Carnby. I'm here to protect you from things you don't believe in.
