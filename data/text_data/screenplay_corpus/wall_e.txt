EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stars. The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More stars. Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas... A single planet. Drab and brown. Moving towards it. Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...Close your eyes and see it glisten..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A range of mountains takes form in the haze. Moving closer. The mountains are piles of TRASH. The entire surface is nothing but waste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silhouetted city in the distance. What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash. Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high. Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues. They go on for miles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something moving on the ground far below. A figure at the foot of a trash heap. A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash. Rusted, ancient. Cute. Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mini-shovel hands collect junk. Scoop it into his open chassis. His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste. A faded label on his corroded chest plate: "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E spits out a cube of trash. Stacks it with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches his eye. Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack. A hubcap. The sun reflects off it. Wall-E checks the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places the hubcap in his compactor. Presses a button on his chest. The song stops playing. The end of a work day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back. Whistles for his pet COCKROACH. The insect hops on his shoulder. They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E travels alone. Traverses miles of desolate waste. Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash. Buildings, highways, entire cities... Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO. "Buy N Large" "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life. There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over. Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!" The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's old treads are threadbare. Practically falling apart. Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach. He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS. Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E now sports the newer treads. Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS. The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
</DIRECTION>

</BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
<DIRECTION>
The holographic billboard powers off. Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance. The mammoth structure sits across the bay. Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK. A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements. A "Buy N Large" logo on its side. Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls on a lever. The back lowers. Wall-E motors up the ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls. KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere. The tired robot removes his newfound treads. Ahh... Home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E motors down the center aisle. Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER. Jury-rigged to an iPod. Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!" The image is very poor quality. Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC). The same song Wall-E worked to.
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[Hums POYSC]
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E opens his cooler. Newfound knickknacks. Pulls out the hubcap from his chest. Looks back at the TV. Mimics the dancers on the screen. Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Continues to unpack: A spork. A Rubik's Cube (unsolved). A Zippo Lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves. They rotate until an empty space appears. His new items are lovingly added to the shelf. The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video. Wall-E is drawn to it. Presses his "Record" button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two lovers sing gently to one another. They kiss...hold hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E tilts his head as he watches. Curious. Holds his own hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E motors outside. Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out. Pauses to take in the night sky. STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze. Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest. The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind picks up. A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest. He looks out into the night. A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck. IOTAM still gently playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E raises the door. Pauses. WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside. The door shuts just as the storm hits. Obliterates everything in view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter. Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie). Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in. It happily dives in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube. Backs into an empty shelf space. Rocks it like a cradle... ...and shuts down for the night. Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING". He wakes. Unboxes. Groggy and lifeless. Stumbles outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The morning sun. Wall-E fully exposed in its light. His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield. A solar collector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His CHARGE METER chimes full. Solar panels fold away into hiding. Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler. Heads off to work. ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach. Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread. The cockroach simply pops back to life. No biggie. Ready to go. Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor. A cube lands by the cockroach.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unsure what it's for. Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses. Tosses it in his cooler.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Presses the remote lock. Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- Plays with a paddle ball.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ball keeps smacking him in the face. He doesn't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Throws out the ring. Keeps the case. The jewel case drops into the cooler, then... ...A RUBBER DUCKY... ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL... ...An OLD BOOT... ...A TROPHY...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Activates it. FOAM blasts in his face. It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself. Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- CU on fridge door.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A WELDING BEAM moves down its center. It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
	</DIALOGUE>
<The_door_falls_apart_in_two_pieces_Reveals>
<DIRECTION>
...a SMALL PLANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in its early stage of growth. Wall-E is entranced. Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot. Dusts dirt off the leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robot and faithful cockroach return home. Wall-E stops short of the threshold. Stares at the ground. Continues staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RED DOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
quivers on the dirt. A single laser point of light. Wall-E moves to touch it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The dot races along the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E drops his Igloo. Chases after the dot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMPTY BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse. He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANY LASER POINTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming from every direction. All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain. Triangulating towards a center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's dot suddenly stops. Slowly he reaches for it. Can't grab it. Just light. ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him. The ground shakes. Wall-E becomes confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doesn't see above him. The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover. A noise. Building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocket engines. Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E runs for it. An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path. A second column of fire. A third. Trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him. Working fast. Noise deafening. Heat rising. Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Then suddenly quiet. Smoke clears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt. Glows red hot from the heat. Trembles with fright. Everything in shadow. Something very big looms over him. Wall-E climbs out of his hole. Bangs his head on metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP. Rests ominously in the empty bay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PORTAL on its underside opens. Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide. Nowhere to go. He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem. Scans the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E creeps closer for a better look. The device unfolds. Wall-E boxes up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem. ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device. Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons. The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a PROBE ROBOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It hovers gracefully above the ground. White. Egg-shaped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue-lit eyes. Female. Eve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E is transfixed. Inches closer. Watches Eve from behind the device. Tilts his head. Time stops. She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve hovers over the ground. A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel. Fans out 180 degrees. Scans random objects and areas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The device rises back into the ship. Exposes Wall-E. He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock. Never takes his eyes off Eve. Watches her float away from the ship. ...from the ship? The ship!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Engines roar back to life. Wall-E digging furiously. The rocket takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke clears. Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground. Looks for Eve. She is watching the ship rise into the clouds. Waits until it is completely out of sight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...then Eve rises high up into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flies around the bay. Soars like a graceful bird. Does loops in the sky. Zooms right past Wall-E's rock. He is hypnotized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve descends gently to the ground... Wall-E sneaks up closer. Hides behind another boulder. Slips. Makes a NOISE. Instantly, Eve whips around. Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON. Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Smoke clears...All quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve, now cold and dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scans the area. No sign of life. All business again. Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock. Trembles uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash. Scans random areas. Wall-E spies from the shadows. Too frightened to approach. She moves on. He follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve probes a mound of tires. Wall-E hiding nearby. He flinches at the sight of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS COCKROACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
innocently approaching Eve from behind. She spins around. Blasts the insect. Wall-E is gut-punched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater. Unscathed. Still curious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve finds the insect intriguing. Lowers her arm. The end separates into individual hovering sections...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...A HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lets the insect crawl up her arm. Wiggles into her workings. It tickles.

Wall-E relaxes. CHUCKLES privately.

Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location. Locks onto him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arm converts to laser cannon. Fires rapidly. Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts. Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E now exposed. Nowhere to hide. Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably. Eve holds her fire.

Wall-E peeks out from his box. Doesn't understand a thing she says. Doesn't care. Can't believe she's real. The cockroach climbs down her gun arm. Jumps onto his master.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve scans Wall-E. A RED LIGHT appears on her chest. Buzzes "negative". He's not what she's looking for. She retracts her gun arm. Hovers off. Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.

LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve scans through the market. Wall-E follows from a safe distance. A stray puppy-dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve glances over at him. Wall-E panics. Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS. Creates an avalanche.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They chase him down a flight of stairs. Wall-E reaches the exit doors. Won't open! Carts pig pile on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E perched on the roof. Patiently watches Eve fly. She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve comes in for a landing below. Shuts down for the night. Wall-E waits. Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape. Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground. Eve doesn't wake. Wall-E creeps up to her. Opens his arms wide... ...and measures her. Turns to a pile of trash. Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...

Eve powers up again. Does a double take. A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her. She hovers away, unimpressed. Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES. Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration. They roll on top of him.

Eve hovers over the freighter. Frustrated. Not finding what she's looking for. Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET. Gets stuck. Wrestles to free herself. Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP. The reaction startles Wall-E.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor. She gives up. Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches. Sits at the other end of the anchor. Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck. Then... ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her. Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him:

Hands her an eggbeater... ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)... ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)... ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)... ...his Hello Dolly tape. Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.

Eve helps him up from the mess. Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off. Dangles from two wires. Eve GASPS with concern. Wall-E placates her.

Feels his way to the rack of shelves. Rotates them until... ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear. Replaces his broken eye with a new one. Eve is relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION. Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME. Wall-E freezes. He had no idea it could do that. Moves closer to inspect it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WALL-E
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the closest he's ever been to Eve. She remains focused on the lighter. Wall-E stares up at her. ...The tiny flame flickering between them... ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background... Suddenly, he is moved to express his love. Musters the courage to open his fingers... ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Eve turns and looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E instantly chokes. Pulls his hand back. Eve becomes intrigued with the TV. Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM... Wall-E watches her. His infatuation still palpable. Then he remembers...

	Ee-vah!

He rushes to his shelves. Eve watches him rummage through junk. A drum falls down on his head. She giggles, charmed by it all. Something about Wall-E...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is drawn back to the lovers on TV... ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand. A tap on her shoulder. She turns to find Wall-E holding something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve immediately locks onto it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drops the lighter. In a flash... ...her chest opens... ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away... ...stores it inside her... Then she shuts down completely. Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest.

Wall-E is stunned. What'd I do? Waves his hand in front of her face.

Wall-E simply going through the motions. No spirit in him at all. Stops. Pulls out the Zippo lighter. Flicks it a few times. A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame. Distant rumbling. Wall-E looks in the direction of his home. A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.

The "AXIOM".

The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.

INT. DOCKING BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in. It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck. The impact knocks Wall-E off. He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the entire dock comes to life. Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear. ...Rise from the floor... ..Lower from the ceiling... It's a cacophony of automation. They all attend to the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and four other probes slide out of the ship's side. Suspended in a horizontal rack. Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him. She remains shut down. Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>

	Ee-vah... ?

A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock. A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.

A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack. M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready. M-O scans Eve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M-O is disgusted. Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean. A VACU-BOT follows after him. Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cleaning crew waits for probe #2. Wall-E studies the routine. Figures out a way to climb down to Eve. When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3. The crane grabs him instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M-O turns around to clean the next probe. Wall-E is lowered in front of him. Boxes up. Confused, M-O scans him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant." M-O is horrified by such filth. A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
</DIRECTION>
<M_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_O>
<DIRECTION>
He scrubs Wall-E full force. Wall-E's front panel pushes him away. Confused, M-O moves to clean him again. Wall-E backs away. Leaves a DIRT TRAIL. M-O curses:
</DIRECTION>
<M_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]

</M_O>
<DIRECTION>
M-O furiously scrubs the floor. Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FAR WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall. Act like hovering caution signs. A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE. He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face. Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E

M-O just finishes cleaning the floor. Wall-E is fascinated. Impishly makes another mark. M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.

	[Look, it stays clean. You got that?]

Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face. M-O loses it. Scrubs his own face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gopher and his steward escort arrive. The cleaning crew stand at attention. Wall-E boxes back up with the probes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gopher begins scanning each probe. Moves down the line. Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe... Stops -- Wait a minute. Turns back. Wall-E is gone. Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds... Reaches Eve. Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her. Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire dock goes to "Code Green"!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alarms sound. Green lights flash. All automation stops.

In rapid succession... ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher... ...A crane-bot loads Eve... ...Curved energy bands lock her down... ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat...

It's all moving too fast for Wall-E. Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ee-vah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E chases after them. Grabs onto the back of the transport. They disappear into the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cleaning crew files out. Follow their lines back to their hold. M-O stops short. Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON M-O'S DISPLAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT"

The tracks lead to the elevator. M-O's neurosis takes over. Must clean dirt. He makes a radical decision and... ...jumps off his line. Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic. Timidly attempts to merge. Sticks out one tread... -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP. Wall-E boxes up. Guns it. Weaves across all the lines on the floor. Bounces off robots like bumper cars.
</DIRECTION>

Barely able to navigate the chaos. Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION. Scans for Eve...

sitting, reclined, in the chair. He is large, round and soft - like a big baby. Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit. The chair seems to be steering itself. Guided by floor lines, just like the robots. Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face. He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:

<DIRECTION>
Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes. Absolutely no reason to ever get up. No purpose. Every one of them engrossed in their video screens. Cocooned in virtual worlds. Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS. The controls allow them to steer... ...order food... ...play games... ...and most of all...

Reaches too far. John falls to the floor. Flails like an upside down turtle. Unable to stand on his baby legs.

INT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monorail emerges into "First Class." A vast, circular plaza of pools. Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments. Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside. All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS.

<DIRECTION>
ON MONORAIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower. The passengers exit. Follow their respective lines. Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower. Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is the last to exit the car. Doesn't follow any lines. Excited by her newfound awareness. Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

	I didn't know we had a pool!

</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve's transport enters the cavernous hall. A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end. A bridge elevator behind him. Blocked by a force field gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The transport pulls up to the typing-bot. Gopher BEEPS. The typing-bot responds by typing. Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open. The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator. Notices Wall-E hiding at the back. Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close. The elevator shoots up to the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The typing-bot looks at its hand. Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture. Huh. Never done that before. Tries it some more...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck. Marvels at it all. His view suddenly goes dark. The elevator doors open on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The large circular room is dimly lit. Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other. A massive console wraps around its entirety. Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps. Suddenly the wheel disengages. The autopilot (AUTO). A single camera eye lights up its center. A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling. Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes. Auto eyes Eve. Scans her. Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Auto detects Eve's plant light. Goes still... Begins computing rapidly. The number "A113" flashes on his lens. An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous. Without warning, Auto heads in his direction. Wall-E boxes up. A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him. Irises open, like a trapdoor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E drops...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and hits the floor hard in the room below. Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Auto lowers through the portal. A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTOPILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTOPILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Shoots back up. The portal closes. Wall-E peeks out of his box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WALL-E'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN across the nautical-themed cabin. One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS. Their years of service listed below. The autopilot in the background of each picture. Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other. From human to gelatinous blob. We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT. A blobby Captain. It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm. Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Activates the POYSC SAMPLE. It plays loud. The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- All hands on deck!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as... ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry... ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT... ...The Captain's bed automatically raises... ...Forms into a hover chair... The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.

<BEAUTICIAN_BOT>
<DIRECTION>
(pre-recorded)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning! Just a trim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAUTICIAN_BOT>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E blends in with the primping. Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(Giggles)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lines light on the floor. Lead his chair automatically to the elevator. Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elevator doors swish open. The Captain still half-asleep. Claps his hands twice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console. Pours a cup. CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers. The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH. Leads him over to the coffee. Wall-E stays lockstep behind him. Auto glides over to the Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTOPILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir --

Wall-E hides under the console just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain reaches for his coffee. Makes a minimal effort. Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward... ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTOPILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, the annual --

He eyes Eve on the transport across the room. Has to get to her. But Auto is right above him. Can't move.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTOPILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTOPILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Auto calls up a screen on the console. Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe. Waits patiently for the Captain to notice. Finally, the Captain turns...
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Auto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<AUTOPILOT>

(disappointed sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Auto, why didn't you wake me for the morning announcements?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge. Wall-E nearly collides with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ducks back under the console.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Grabs a large dial. TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it. Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT ON LIDO DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE. - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS. - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom. A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN. Displays a live video feed of the Captain. The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(ON INTERCOM) (unmotivated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good morning everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise. Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be...

	<DIALOGUE>

Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING. The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your free...

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mic feedback whine)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console. It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTOPILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTOPILOT>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain turns to Auto. For the first time he notices Eve. Finally. Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
</DIRECTION>
<AUTOPILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probe One has returned positive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUTOPILOT>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Positive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Auto re-activates Eve. She wakes. Rises to salute the Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy. She's okay! He is compelled to head straight for her...
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...no probe's ever come back positive...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at flashing button)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The flashing button is practically calling to him. Can't resist. Presses it. Instantly SHADES close on all the windows. The room goes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him. Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
</DIRECTION>
<BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greetings and congratulations, Captain! If you're seeing this, that means your Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or...

	..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth with a confirmed specimen of ongoing photosynthesis!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen. Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
</DIRECTION>
<BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, it means it's time to go back home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>

	Home? W-w-we're going back?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that Earth has been restored to a life-sustaining status, by golly, we can begin "Operation Recolonize"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
<DIRECTION>
A section of the console illuminates. An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...into a passing Wall-E's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E immediately boxes up. Holds the manual over his head. The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium. Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover. It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE". Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.
</DIRECTION>
<BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simply follow this manual's instructions to place the plant in your ship's holo- detector, and the --

<DIRECTION>
An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge. The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up. A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine. A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain listens closely to the instructions. Wall-E paying attention as well.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
Huh? Huh?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve. Heads in her direction.
</DIRECTION>
<BUY_N_LARGE_CEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity, you and your passengers may have suffered some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few laps around your ship's jogging track will get you back in shape in no time.

The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.

Auto intervenes. Clips the corner of the cover with his handle... ...and simply opens the book. The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated. Lifts the cover with his own fingers.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a trim? Uh huh.

</BEAUTICIAN_BOT>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm. Placed in an empty force field pen. Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT: ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E... ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face... Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly. Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve slides past Wall-E. Carried by an orderly-arm. Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM. The frosted glass doors shut.

<DIRECTION>
- An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The orderly-arms struggle to close it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It bursts into flames.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode. A series of tests begin. Eve is annoyed but calm. It's all routine. An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors. Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE. To him, her arm is being ripped off.

<DIRECTION>
Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E

Wall-E watches in horror. It looks as if Eve is being tortured. Mistakes the screeching for her screams. Wall-E struggles to free himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE WITH EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is washed and scrubbed. A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body. It feels good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON WALL-E
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks as if Eve is being beheaded. He needs to stop the torture. Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field. The barrier shorts out. Wall-E tumbles to the floor. Lands on his "Play" button. POYSC blares across the ward. The Rejects all stop and stare.
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!

An orderly lunges at him. Wall-E panics. Shoots! The gun fires backwards. It blasts through the repair ward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL.

Wall-E shrinks. He knows he's in trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>

The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT. ...All orderly-arms go limp... ...The repair ward doors open up... ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rejects look at each other for a beat. Then CHEER wildly. We're free!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mob of robots all rush Wall-E. Lift him on their shoulders. Carry their hero out of the ward. Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve watches in astonishment. This day just gets worse and worse. She flies off after them.

...The steward CAMERA EYES take a snapshot of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALL AROUND THE SHIP
</DIRECTION>

Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Match them with the "Wanted" screens. Call attention to them. Point. Stewards in hot pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY. Lets the stewards pass by. She glances out the porthole...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EVE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can see the DOCKING BAY below her. Just under the bay doors...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS.

Eve gets an idea. Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway...

FLASH! Banks of controls light up around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ESCAPE POD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is revealed at the end of the room. Its hatch automatically opens. Bathes the room with light from its lit interior. Eve turns to Wall-E:
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earth.

<DIRECTION>
She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN. It displays coordinates to Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>

	Earth.

</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod. He happily complies. Jumps up on one of the seats. Pats the seat next to him. Aren't you coming?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve remains at the threshold. Shakes her head. Points to her chest. Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Directive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
...She's not going.

The hallway elevator CHIMES. They both look up. Someone is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve shuts off everything. Lights go out. The pod closes back up. Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall. Blend in with the other wall fixtures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They HEAR something hover into the room. Can't see what it is. Then... An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over the console. Presses buttons. The pod lights up again. The hatch opens. The stranger's SHADOW comes around the console to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOPHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve and Wall-E look at each other. Gopher? They watch from the shadows as... ...Gopher enters the pod... ...opens his chest cavity... ...emits his suspension beam...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and deposits the PLANT.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>

Gopher exits the pod.

<DIRECTION>
He's gone.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Too late. Gopher hits a button. The pod door shuts on Wall-E...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and launches into space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gopher shuts off the room. Exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve leaps out of the shadows. Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW. Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance. The plant icon on Eve's chest glows. She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK. Enters it like a phone booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve bursts out into space. Rockets after Wall-E.

He clambers up into the pilot's seat. Pulls back hard on the throttle. Nothing happens. Looks down at the console. A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:

He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Uses it as a form of propulsion. Eve is consumed with relief. Chases after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

He points the extinguisher the other way. Attempts to fly back over to her. It's hard to steer...

...Sensors zero in on the plant... ...Confirm its authenticity... ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears... ...Draws directions to the bridge... ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"...

Eve is ecstatic. She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam. Seals it safely in her chest. Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms. Spins him around.

...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool.

CLOSE ON FEET

They ripple the surface of the pool. John and Mary float over the water's surface. Splash one another playfully.

<DIRECTION>
A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower. Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
</DIRECTION>
<LIFEGUARD_BOT>

John splashes the robot. It shorts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON UPPER DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck. Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS. Eve peeks through the towels. Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS. On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance. No way in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRASH-BOT passes. Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE. Eve keys in on the chute. It runs all the way up the tower...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...to the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WALL-E
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at EVE'S HAND. Time to seize the moment. Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest. It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker. Puts his hands together...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve whips around. What's that noise?! Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
	<DIALOGUE>
	E-vah --

<DIRECTION>
Eve immediately shuts off his music. Shoves his hands down.

</DIRECTION>

	[Stop it! They'll hear us!]

She places a stack of towels on his head. Gestures for Wall-E to stay put. Points to her PLANT LIGHT.

	Directive.

</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone. Zooms silently across the Lido Deck. Up into the trash chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sits in space. The AXIOM glides towards it. Something's not right. We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...

The Captain sits by his window to space. Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.

</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
ON TRASH CAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel. Blows the lid off. The Captain is stunned by this vision. She opens her chest to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the plant.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How...? How'd you find it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Eve hovers over to him. Salutes. Formally presents him the plant. He takes it in his hands. Still potted in the old boot. Gazes at it in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can go back home...for the first time!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it like now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Eve shrugs. Doesn't know how to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for myself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to his console. Hits a button. A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel. The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device. Plays back images of her time on Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past. All displayed from Eve's POV: ...Being delivered to Earth... ...Flying above the devastated landscape... ...Blowing up a rock... ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...that doesn't look like Earth... Where's the blue sky...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over to his computer screen. The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display. Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Where's the grass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
His face drops. Slumps in defeat. The dream is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays... It stirs the Captain out of his funk. He looks up at the screen. Leans in for a closer look.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I know that song...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(observes the dancers' feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
A rueful smile grows on his face. He looks down at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FOOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's tapping in time to the music. His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands. He lifts it up. Makes the boot dance.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You made it somehow, eh little guy? You didn't give up, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
As if in response, the plant wilts slightly. A leaf drops.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(Gasp!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, no --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(remembers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain urgently hovers across the room. Eve left alone. Her recorded memories continue playing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve recognizes the music. Watches the lovers on screen hold hands. Something familiar about the gesture... Looks at her own hands. Slowly, she interlocks her fingers... ...Eve's eyes go wide. This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her memories continue on the screen: ...a tap on the shoulder... ...Wall-E presents her the plant -- ...The screen goes BLACK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out: ...protecting her from the rain... ...the sun...the sandstorm... ...keeping watch night and day... ...trying to jump start her heart...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her. Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.

</WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
Becomes impatient. Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE. Sticks his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EE-VAHH?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. The chute has an endless drop. Wall-E climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place. Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT ON THE UPPER DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monorail pulls up. M-O steps off. Still hot on Wall-E's trail. Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby. Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...leading to the trash chute.
</DIRECTION>

	There you go little guy. You came a long way for a drink of water... Just needed someone to look after you, that's all --

He is struck with a notion. Stares out the window at space for a beat. Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant. Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.

He's still waiting for her. She turns to leave and finds
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUTO

lowering in front of her. Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand. "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
</DIRECTION>

Auto rises back into the ceiling. Lowers down over the vanity console. High speed button pushing. A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears. Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY".

<DIRECTION>
The Captain turns away in frustration. His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS. Notices AUTO in every one of them. Looking over all their shoulders. A little closer every generation. The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder... ...and Auto is right behind him. The Captain looks at the plant in his lap. His countenance grows determined. He rights his hat... ...turns to face Auto... ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today!

Auto slides into his face. Makes the Captain flinch. No more Mr. Nice Robot. Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOPHER

shoots out of a pneumatic tube. Salutes Auto. Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay. She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.

Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher. The robot raises his epaulet arms. Don't shoot! She opens her chest cavity. Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
</DIRECTION>

	Eve, you are to put this plant straight in the Holo-detector.

It's over. The plant is gone. But in that frozen moment...
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out. He wheezes... ...then drops lifelessly down the chute.
</DIRECTION>

Eve screams. Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto. The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed. She shuts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE

<DIRECTION>
Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening. Drops her down the chute. She bangs against the sides as she tumbles.

Gopher salutes Auto and exits. Auto turns to the Captain. He is in shock.

Black. The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes. Her view comes into focus. Scans around. Disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH. Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere. Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES.

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, her area is flooded in light. She flinches at the sight of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they rumble up behind her. Headlights for eyes. They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E. "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts. Each grab a ton of trash at once. Eve is swept up with the junk. Compact it. Spit it out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her cube is picked up. Transported to a waiting platform. Stacked with other massive cubes. Eve discovers...

Again the alarms kick in. The platform slides on rails... ...across the safety line... ...into the airlock... ...the inner shield doors begin to close...

Eve needs to act fast. Her gun arm stuck inside the cube. Struggles to activate it... ...It cocks. BLASTS herself free. Flies over to Wall-E. He's stuck deep in the cube...

	No! WALL-E!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
M-O's head drops in despair. The passengers witness grief for the first time. Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy. Mary begins to cry. Buries her head in John's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no! Wall-E...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>

</SHIP_S_COMPUTER>
<DIRECTION>
The ceiling countdown hits "0:00."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AXIOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship jumps to light speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet. Everyone holds on to one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel. Fights the G-forces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIDO DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Humans and robots hang on for dear life. John and Mary cling to each other and the babies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds tightly to Wall-E. Still calling out his name. No response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EARTH - HILLSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cockroach waits obediently on the hill. Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay. His antennae twitch with boredom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RED DOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears on the ground. The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside. The ground begins to shake. Daylight dims. The insect looks to the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CLOUD COVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds. Blots out the sunlight. The Axiom's keel breaks through. Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cockroach senses his master's return. HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him. He eagerly chases after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON AXIOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky. Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth. Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT. Thousands of feet deep. The ship's keel descends into it. The earth shudders. Trash towers tumble in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Then all is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship. MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend. Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain walks out gingerly. Holding the boot w/ plant. The other passengers step out on their own legs. Wobble like toddlers. They squint up at the harsh sunlight. A commotion is heard from the back. Somebody trying to push through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
appears out of the crowd. Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
M-O and the Rejects follow behind her. They rush across the gangway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cockroach meets up with Eve. Climbs up onto Wall-E. Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding. Eve urgently scans the landscape. Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance. She takes to the air. M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
</DIRECTION>
<M_O>
<DIRECTION>
(beeps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[Eve! Wait!]
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_O>
<DIRECTION>
The Captain respectfully removes his hat. Good luck, friend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior is dark and still. Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens. Eve flies inside with Wall-E. Sets him on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans the rotating shelves at high speed. Grabs a CAR JACK. Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve... ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E... ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion... ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece... ...She opens his new solar panels...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rejects stop. See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode. Oh no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E. Eve holds her breath, watches... Waits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Beep... ...Beep...
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (Apple "reboot" SFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E's meter fully charges. His head slowly rises from his box. Blinks. The cockroach hops with joy. Eve is relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...She holds out her hand to him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(with love)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wall-E...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E gives her a blank stare. He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck. She grabs him. Turns him back around.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(It's me!)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eve!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E just stares. Doesn't seem to know who she is.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(hums)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[Here, look at these.]
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf. The light bulb glows in her hand. She gives them to Wall-E. No reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(Remember?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wall-E?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(hums)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[I know!]
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She hovers over to the video player. Plays HELLO DOLLY. Looks back to see if it has any effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E is over at the shelves. Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor. Crushes them into a cube. Eve is gut-punched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E motors outside. Runs over the cockroach on his way out. The insect pops back to life. Watches his friend in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile. Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube. Eve hovers over to him. Still in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
<DIRECTION>
(somber)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E continues to stack his cubes. She stops him. Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes. Nobody home. Eve presses his "play" button. Nothing but STATIC. Eve begins to panic. Shakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
No response. He's gone. She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand. Forces his fingers to interlace with hers. Holds him close one last time. Leans her head against his. Hums softly.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[Hums IOTAM]
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She touches her forehead to his. Goodbye Wall-E. A TINY SPARK between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve turns to hover away. Jerked back. Her fingers caught between his. She checks his eyes again. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a tiny SERVO NOISE. She looks down at their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They start to move. Slowly close around Eve's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at his face. Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus. His brows raise...
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ee-vah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALL_E>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wall-E!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
He notices their hands entwined. His dream come true.
</DIRECTION>
<WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ee-vah!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALL_E>
<DIRECTION>
She giggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"And that is all that love's about..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes. M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck. They begin to celebrate. Wall-E's alive! Then M-O realizes they need privacy. Herds the Rejects O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<M_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Go, go go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</M_O>
<DIRECTION>
Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch. Together now and ever more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP OF THE PLANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Newly planted in the earth. Small hands water it gently. PULL OUT to reveal it surrounded by kids. The Captain instructs them. John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom. Robots and passengers stream off the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is called "farming"! You kids are going to grow all kinds of plants: vegetable plants, pizza plants!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, it's good to be home...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS OUT from the Axiom... ...over the bay...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...That it only took a moment..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...past Wall-E & Eve holding hands in his truck... ...over M-O and the Rejects cleaning outside... ...Through the trash towers of the city... ...past a FIELD OF PLANTS, sprouting from its peak... ...up through the cloud cover... ...out into space...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...To be loved a whole life long."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and settles on... ...our single... ...drab... ...brown... ...little planet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IRIS OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
