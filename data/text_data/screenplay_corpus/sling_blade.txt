INT. A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper with a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette and staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man, KARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his hands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring and Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant approaches Charles.

	A Mercury is a good car and that's what I was driving that day. I've owned a lot of cars. Different kinds. Lots of different kinds of cars. She was standing, this girl, on the side of the street where there was a chicken stand; not the Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless a chicken stand, and I pulled the Mercury over and rolled down the window by electric power. She was wearing a leather skirt and she had a lot of hair on her arms. I like that. I like it a lot. It means a big bush. I like a big bush. She said, "Are you dating?" I said, "yes," and she got in the car. We pulled to a remote location, one that she and I both felt comfortable with and she said, "How much can you spend?" I said, "What it takes to see your bush. I know it's a big one." She said "twenty five dollars," which to a working man is not chicken feed. I produced the money and she put it in her shoe and pulled up her skirt. There before me lay a thin, crooked, uncircumcised penis. You can imagine how badly I wanted my twenty-five dollars back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a young man named John Liggit Hunter who was in the filling station business and a good filling station business. He was one of those young men that we run across so often in life. I'm sure you've run across them, that didn't deserve the things he had. One of those things was his beautiful bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia Peach. As a matter of fact she looked more like the picture I've had in my head than any woman I've ever seen. I took it upon myself to take her away from John Liggit Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm not sure if I mentioned that he was a Frenchman who claimed to be an Englishman. It took some very strong nylon cord to take her away from him. She was a fighter as well as a Georgia Peach.

	You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother.

<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I reckon what you're a wanting to know is what I'm doing in here. I reckon the reason I'm in here is 'cause I killed somebody. But I reckon what you was a wanting to know is how come me to kill somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start at the front and tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, heavy breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lived most of my life out behind my mother and father's house in a little old shed and my daddy'd built for me. They didn't too much want me up there in the house with the rest of 'em. I mostly just set around out there in the shed all the time a lookin' at the ground. It didn't have no floor but I had me a hole dug out to lay down in and a quilt or tow that I put down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, more breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daddy was a hard workin' man most of his life, not that I can say the same fer myself. I most just set around the shed and tinkered around with a lawn mower or two and went to school off and on from time to time but the children there made quite a bit of sport of me, made fun of me quite a bit. Some of 'em roughed me up sometimes so mostly I stayed out back there in the shed. My daddy worked down at the sawmill there, down there at the planer mill for an old man named Dixon. Old man Dixon was a very cruel feller, he didn't treat his employees very well, didn't pay 'em much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy much of a wage, just barely enough to get by on. But I reckon he got by all right, they come out one or the other of 'em, usually my mother, and fed me pretty regular. At least I know he made enough for me to have mustard and biscuits three or four times a week. Old man Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon. Jesse was really more cruel than his daddy. He made quite a bit of sport of me and takened advantage of the little girls around the neighborhood quite a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He used to say my mother was a very pretty woman. He said it quite a bit from time to time, when I was at the school house. Well, I reckon you want me to get on and tell you what happened so I reckon I'll tell you. I was settin' out in the shed one evenin' not doin' too much, just kindly starin' at the wall and a waitin' fer my mother to come out and give me my Bible lesson and I heared a commotion up in the house there so I got up and run up on the screened-in porch there to see what was a goin' on, and I looked in the kitchen window and I seen my mother a layin' there on the floor without any clothes on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on top of her having his way with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I just seen red. I picked up a kaiser blade that was a layin' there by the screen door, some folks calls it a sling blade, I call it a kaiser blade. It's just a long handle like a axe handle with a long blade on it that's shaped kind of like a banana. Sharp on one edge and dull on the other. It's what the highway boys use to cut down weeds and whatnot. I went in the kitchen there and I hit Jesse Dixon up side the head with it and knocked him off my mother. I reckon that didn't quite satisfy me so I hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge and just plumb near cut his head off. Killed him. Well, my mother, she jumped up from there and started yellin', "What did you kill Jesse fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, intense breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, come to find out my mother didn't really mind what Jesse was a doin' to her. I reckon that made me madder than what Jesse had made me. I takened the kaiser blade, some folks calls it a sling blade, I call it a kaiser blade and hit my mother up side the head with it an' killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(long pause, breathing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some folks has asked me if I had it to do over again would I do the same thing. I don't know, I reckon I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here and here I've been for a great long while. I've learned to read some; took me four years to read the Bible. I reckon I understand a good deal of it. It wasn't what I expected in a lot of places. I've slept in a good bed for a great long while. They've seen fit to put me out now. They tell me they're a settin' me free today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all you need to know. If you want any more details I reckon I can tell 'em to you. I don't know if that's enough for your newspaper or not.

Karl is walking down a residential street. He stops in front of the house where the boy, Frank, lives and stares at the house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares at it. A curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the window. He comes and opens the door.

INT. BEN'S DOLLAR STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Karl make their way through the fairly crowded store. It's sort of a mini-version of a Walmart. They find Frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red Ben's knit shirt. They are laughing together and pricing some mouthwash. LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her thirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties, with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging over his belt. They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys approach.

	Yeah.

</FRANK>
<VAUGHAN>

	You're gonna rot your teeth that way. But I bet I know what you would like even better. I put potted meat on special, four cans for a dollar and they're not moving very well. I'd sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHAN>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying the spoils of their Ben's Dollar Store visit.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.

	You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks at the ground for a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.

</FRANK>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he do that, reckon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>

	'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.

<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard it said that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<VAUGHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?

	I wouldn't never hurt them.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle. Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue, which has obviously been going on for awhile.
</DIRECTION>
<MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow me on those particular points, but it's not really important in the smaller picture, which is where most people dwell anyway. Not that being manager of Ben's Dollar Store is insignificant. Or that making it through years of incarceration in a state supported facility is any small feat.

<DIRECTION>
Vaughan, ALBERT the "friend," Linda, Frank, Karl, and MELINDA, the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table. Karl and Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat. This goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns to Karl.

	So Karl, do you intend to stay in the lawnmower business for a while or do you have other plans?

<VAUGHAN>

	I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAUGHAN>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<ALBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the same way. Of course, in my line of work, I stay too busy to read. But at least I have job security. People may stop doing a lot of things, but one thing is for sure, they won't stop dying.

</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?

	Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.

	So it died when it come out?

</FRANK>
<KARL>

	My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.

<KARL>

	I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was still alive when you buried it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>

	That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>

	Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it.

	Well, what it is is, I just, well I took off work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we could talk. I guess you'd say I'm really here to apologize, which ain't easy for me to do, about the way I acted the other night. I was just drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another. I care about y'all a lot, I do. I don't mean to be so damned, assholish I guess the word would be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit you, did I? So no apology needed there I guess, but Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama. I'm just jealous of her. I don't like her life or the way she runs it. I don't like homosexuals and she buddies with one. I don't like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin' mental retards and she's got one of each livin' with her.

It's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. Karl, Frank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up. Four boys are lined on defense. They break the huddle and come to the line. They are on about the fifty-yard line. Frank hikes the ball to one of the boys. He later als it to Karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run toward him. Then he takes off like the wind. He runs funny, kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast. All the others are chasing him. Two of the other team's boys catch him on about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. Karl sees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the ball just as Karl bites the dirt. Frank goes into the end zone untouched. There are cheers from Frank and the other boys. Frank runs over to Karl who's still on the ground.

Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a stick. He hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees Karl coming toward him.

	I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.

</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.

</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DIRECTION>
He hands him the books.
</DIRECTION>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to give away all your books.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in the trees.

<FRANK>

</VAUGHAN>
<KARL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.

<VAUGHAN>

</VAUGHAN>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Karl starts away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
	</DIALOGUE>

Vaughan watches Karl walk away.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching TV. He looks up as Karl comes around and sits on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>

<DOYLE>

	What numbers do you punch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(notices blade)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I aim to kill you with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police you push 911. You'll need to tell 'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're gonna kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear one short dull thud.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God! Oh God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood on his face, hand and shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<KARL>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ma'am. I need the police over here at the Wheatley house.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've killed somebody with a mower blade.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I hit him two good whacks. That second time just plumb near cut his head in two.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hits a little old yeller house right on the corner of Marigold Street and some other street. They's a red pickup truck out front says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION on it. I'll be a settin' here waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the police, Doyle said you might want to send a ambulance or a hearse. Thank ye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the mustard jar and runs the knife around it. There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They was a boy. We made friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's not too big in here, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say nothin' about that boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DIRECTION>
Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.
</DIRECTION>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fact the bidness, don't you say another word to me. I ain't listenin' to you no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARL>
<DIRECTION>
Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the grass that separates him from the next building. He stares out the window, as we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
