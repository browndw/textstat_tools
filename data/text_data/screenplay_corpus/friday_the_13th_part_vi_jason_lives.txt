:SC: Friday the 13th Part IV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NIGHT SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ominous black clouds roll across the heavens. THUNDER begins to RUMBLE within the clouds. An unsettling feeling of approaching danger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS FOREST SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep shadowed woods. A quiet breeze rustles some dry leaves. NOISY CRICKETS. Some unseen creature runs through the bush. THE CRICKETS STOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very mangy wild dog feeds on what was once a rabbit run over in the road. ROARING AROUND THE BEND COMES AN OLD FORD PICKUP. The terrified canine runs for its life into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PICKUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HOCKEY MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stare down on Jason's infamous mask held in a young man's (HAWES) hands.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
(Southern accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how the hell you talked me into this, Jarvis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting in the passenger seat examining the mask is ALLEN HAWES. He is a rather unusual-looking guy in his mid- twenties, nervously smoking a cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, I must be crazy. If the old institution ever found out about this...boy, they'd throw our butts back in an' strait-jacket 'em permanent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't have to come, Hawes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
PRESS IN - ON DRIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY JARVIS is a good-looking young man in his late teens. He drives like a bat out of hell, wearing a very intense expression of determination.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is between me and Jason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT ON THEM
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming more nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know. But I still don't get the therapy here. Jason's dead, right? How will seeing his corpse stop your hallucinations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seeing it won't. But destroying him once and for all will. Jason belongs in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna see he gets there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares wide-eyed at Tommy. He then turns to look out the back window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PICKUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE IN REAR WINDOW - TILT DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge can of gasoline, a crowbar and two shovels are seen in the back of the truck. THUNDER BEGINS TO RUMBLE LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dust kicks up as the old pickup races down the road. LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the dark woods. THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING along a row of tombstones, we follow Tommy and his flashlight as he searches. Hawes follows, carrying the gas can, tools and mask. THUNDER continues as a fierce, whistling WIND attacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy's eyes squint to read each tombstone, looking for the one. LIGHTNING FLASHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER - ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting frustrated, but far from giving up, Tommy moves to the new row of markers. Suddenly he freezes and we PRESS IN on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JASON'S GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING illuminates the tombstone that reads "Jason Voorhees - At Rest".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stares, a deep terror chills his bones. Something else then catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ANOTHER GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close to Jason's marker we see another. It reads "Pamela Voorhees - Beloved Mother."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT ON TOMMY AND HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returning his attention to Jason's grave, Tommy points "this is the one" to Hawes, who gulps and nods. Putting down the other items, the boys take hold of the shovels. Tommy raises his up first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
plunges into the ground. A LIGHTNING BLAST punctuates it as it removes a large chunk of grass and dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON OUR GRAVEDIGGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to exhume the legendary killer's body. Tommy works feverishly. Hawes works nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again and again their shovels strike, digging into the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOVEL (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is scraping the dirt of of a rotted coffin lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE UP - ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sweating boy tosses the shovel out of the shallow grave. Hawes silently hands him the crowbar from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowbar is driven into the side. Tommy's hands take a firm grip and yank. A HORRIFIC CREAK resounds as the lid cracks open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the crowbar back to Hawes. They exchange a look and a deep breath. Tommy then goes for it. His hands extend slowly toward the coffin. More THUNDER GROWLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY'S FINGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slip into the narrow space beneath the coffin lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESS IN TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He winces and bites his lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With all the courage he can muster, Tommy strains to do the deed. He yanks the casket open!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JASON IN COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHTNING, the lid swings open to reveal the huge decomposing body of JASON. His HEAD IS COMPLETELY COVERED BY AN ARMY OF DISGUSTING MAGGOTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWES GASPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fights with his stomach to keep his dinner down..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY CLIMBS OUT OF GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and stares down at his nemesis. A slow hatred begins to build. We PRESS IN on Tommy, HEARING his horrid memories: His sister screams, NO, TOMMY, NO while 10-year-old Tommy kills Jason, repeating, "DIE, DIE!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he listens, his eyes well up with a violent rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy looks around vengefully. Seeing an old fence a few yards away, he heads for it. Hawes is confused by his actions.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK WITH TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, he storms over to the rusty fence. He grabs one of the spearlike posts and pulls it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - DOLLY BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With fire in his eyes, Tommy stalks Jason with the weapon. THUNDER ROARS ABOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rushes up to Tommy, greatly alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that for? Tommy, what are you doin', boy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
The boy storms right past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACHING THE GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy glares down hatefully at this monster who has destroyed his loved ones and his life. Raising the spear, he explodes and jumps down.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he lands in the grave, Tommy plunges the spear down with a mighty force. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING BLAST HELLISHLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SPEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
penetrates deep into Jason's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HAWES, DUMBFOUNDED
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
withdraws it, then angrily rams it down again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The force of the blows causes many of the numerous maggots to start dropping off his face. Grossly decayed flesh is illuminated the LIGHTNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON TOMMY'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted, his rage finally vented, he drives the spear into Jason for the last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN - ON TOMMY AND JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the boy's shoulder we see the long spear extending out of Jason's cold heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Recovering from his tantrum, Tommy climbs out of the grave. Hawes stares open-mouthed at his friend.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, he must've really messed you over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches down, picks up Jason's hockey mask, and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - HOCKEY MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems to stare back evilly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Fuck you, Jason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy, knowing the nightmare is finally over, tosses the mask into the grave. He then bends down and starts to uncap the gas can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ON SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, the sky EXPLODES with a mass of LIGHTNING. One of the BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY is drawn to the spear as to a lightning rod. SPARKS fly as the spear is struck and electrified. Tommy and Hawes dive for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON JASON'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S DECOMPOSED EYELIDS FLASH OPEN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TOMMY AND HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uncovering their heads, they look skyward in fear. Quickly, Tommy gets to his feet and goes for the troublesome spear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unintended lightning rod is still smoking a little from the blast. He touches it. It's hot. He pulls out a pair of gloves from his jacket. Putting them on, he then attempts to remove the spear. He can't get proper leverage. So Tommy jumps down into Jason's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles to pull the spear out. It's apparently driven into the bottom of the coffin as well. Hawes leans down into the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just get the hell out of here. My heart can't take any more of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWES>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason's wicked eyes glare at Tommy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy, of course, does not see what's about to occur. He finally yanks the spear out, and throws it up onto the grass. Slowly he removes his gloves and tosses them to Hawes. He starts to climb out. JASON SPRINGS UP FROM BEHIND AND GRABS HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HAWES SCREAMING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes crazy with hysteria. He starts to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN - ON GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy fights for his life as Jason tries to pull him down into the grave. He manages to kick Jason back down long enough to climb out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scrambles for the gas can as the STORM CLOUDS DETONATE ABOVE. He gets it open, turns around, and starts throwing it on the rising corpse of Jason.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gas splashes all over him as he keeps coming!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He backs up as Jason stalks him. Knowing there's enough gas now on his predator, he drops the can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHTER - ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's coming closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHTER - ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicking, he searches his pockets for the matches. He finds them. As he pulls them out, the STORM CLOUDS ERUPT WITH AN INCREDIBLE DOWNPOUR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops as the rain drenches him. Maggots start to wash off him as he stares at his helpless victim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries desperately to light a match in this pounding rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggling with the soaked matchbook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
starts to close in. Suddenly HAWES EMERGES FROM BEHIND, HOLDING UP A SHOVEL. He HOLLERS as he swings it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He WHACKS the back of Jason's head as hard as he can. It doesn't even faze his undead superkiller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON WHIPS AROUND ON HAWES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arm lunges forcefully at Hawes' chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HAWES' BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S HAND, CLUTCHING HAWES' HEART, BURST OUT HAWES' BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GRAVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawes' body falls back into Jason's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Hawes lands in the coffin, the lid shuts over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified and weaponless, he runs like hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing his victim escaping, Jason whips around and looks for a weapon. He goes for the nefarious spear. Something in the grave then catches his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy races out of the cemetery to his pickup. He jumps into the truck and takes off in the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his back to us, Jason dons his beloved hockey mask and picks up the spear. We PRESS IN TIGHT ON HIM as he turns around to face us. FREEZE FRAME. Meaner, stronger, and more unstoppable than ever before...

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Tommy's old pickup SCREECHES UP before us. He leaps from the truck and races for the office door. The sign by it reads "Forest Green County Sheriff's Dept."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy BURSTS into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHERIFF BEHIND DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF MICHAEL GARRIS is a hard-ass Vietnam vet who, at forty-three, has "seen enough trouble and don't want no more." That's why he took this job a few years back. Having just nodded off, Tommy's entrance startles him. He leaps to his feet, gun drawn with lightning speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked by the sheriff's sudden aggression, Tommy instantly throws up his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHERIFF

He relaxes, seeing it's just a teenager. But he's still pissed off as he holsters his gun.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy tries to control his emotions and sound rational.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason is alive. We dug up his body. I was gonna cremate it and...

(cutting him off again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?

</SHERIFF>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(catching his drift)

</DEPUTY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOORWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEPUTY RICK COLONE hurries in with an armload of fast food. Dark, mid-thirties, and a little on the short side. He is surprised to see someone here this late.

TIGHT ON SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in toward Tommy's cell.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got that right. Now you listen up. I'm sorry for what happened to you and your folks years ago. But no one in Forest Green wants to be reminded of what that maniac did here. That's why they changed the name to Forest Green. People want to forget this was once Crystal Lake. And they don't need some kid stirring up Jason shit again.

INT. CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A likable couple in their mid-twenties are obviously lost. LIZBETH drives and giggles, slap-happy from the long trip and late hour. Her boyfriend, DARREN, struggles to read the map in the dim car light. A huge pothole causes him to bang his head on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you slow down? It's hard enough to read this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, who told me to take this cow path?

</LIZBETH>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<LIZBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
DARREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throws down the map with a growl.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much for the head counselors ever finding the camp on their own. I say we stop the car, get out, and start screaming for help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
The car comes to a grinding halt.

</LIZBETH>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</DARREN>
<LIZBETH>

	Why? Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.

He stares intensely at Lizbeth.

<DARREN>

	There's no way we can do this...

(he looks at Jason)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...If the car drops into that gully, we'll never get it out.

<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just stands his ground. He ain't backin' down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZBETH

ANGLE ON DARREN AND LIZBETH

He bites his lip nervously.

<LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>

	We're gonna scare him?!

</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
Darren attempts to pump up a macho attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>

	That's right. Just drive toward him. He'll move. Nobody wants to die.

INSERT - ACCELERATOR

Her foot stomps it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH WINDSHIELD

We race toward Jason, who doesn't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - BRAKE

Her foot slams on the brakes.

LOW ANGLE - ON HEADLIGHT

The car skids to a stop, inches from the stock-still killer.

LIZBETH

turns to her now-less-than-confident boyfriend.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZBETH>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that really scared the shit out of him.

ANGLE ON DARREN
</DIRECTION>

He gets pissed. He leans over and BLASTS the HORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - ON JASON

<DIRECTION>
Jason gets pissed too. He swings the spear and SMASHES OUT a headlight.
</DIRECTION>

	Oh, jeez.

</DARREN>
<LIZBETH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
Darren, now angered, grabs her hand as she starts to shift.

<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darren opens it and pulls out a .22 revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares at the gun, then at Darren, in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you get that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
Darren gets out of the car. He's scared shitless, but tries not to show it.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it. Just stay cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches Darren's every move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOLLY BACK ON DARREN TO JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With great apprehension he heads toward Jason, holding the gun out with both hands. He clears his nervous throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, scumbag. Get out of the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
From over Jason's shoulder we see Darren cock the trigger and aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly Jason rams the spear into the other headlight! He is now a very dark figure in front of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams, and shouts at her boyfriend.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZBETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darren, get in here right now! He'll kill you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DARREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets a bit cocky, knowing he's the one with the gun. He glances back at his girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if I get him first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARREN>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly CHARGES him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DARREN AND JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darren fires. But the bullet either misses or it just doesn't affect Jason. He thrusts the spear forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SPEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drives right through Darren's stomach and out his back!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESS IN ON LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes hysterical.
</DIRECTION>

LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Effortlessly, he lifts up the impaled boy and tosses his limp body aside. Jason then turns his murderous gaze on Lizbeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lizbeth gasps. Quickly, she tries to drive away. Seeing something coming, she dives across the other seat. JASON'S SPEAR SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND IMPALES ITSELF INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The terrified girl crawls out of the open passenger door. She falls into the muddy and water-filled gully alongside the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT - ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He withdraws his weapon from the car and heads for his victim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggles to stand. She slips, badly twisting or breaking her ankle. Looking back quickly, she is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER P.O.V. - ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with spear poised, he's coming!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knowing it's hopeless to run, she tries a last-ditch effort to barter for her life. Lying in the muddy water, Lizbeth digs into her jacket. She pulls out her wallet and removes her money and credit cards.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't kill me, please. You can have these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIZBETH>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up and offers her valuables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIZBETH'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO LIZBETH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is amazed. Where did he go? What's the difference -- she's safe. WRONG. As she looks behind her, JASON'S FEET SLAM DOWN IN THE WATER NEXT TO HER HEAD. She opens her mouth to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - UP ON JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the spear and RAMS IT DOWN TOWARD HER FACE! A spine-chilling CRUNCH is HEARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason stands over his victim... Her body floats on the filthy water, but her head is drive down underneath. BLOOD begins to bubble up around the extended spear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lifeless hand releases the money and credit cards it was clutching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the floating American Express card along the now- bloody stream... Remember, don't leave home without it.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Tommy is asleep on the cot in his cell. Suddenly the LOUD SOUNDS of the DOOR OPENING and YOUNG VOICES startle him awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT - ON GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Entering from the bright sunshine are the sheriff and four kids in their late teens. Teasing, holding on to the arm of her sheriff father, is MEGAN. She is a cute and feisty 18- year-old. Her three friends, PAULA, a warm and personable girl with a short new-wave haircut; SISSY is black, sexy and very boy-crazy; and CORT, with his long hair and heavy metal T-shirt, is always ready to rock.
</DIRECTION>
<MEGAN>

	Come on, Dad. You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEGAN>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.

</SHERIFF>
<CORT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff, couldn't you like put our an all-points bulletin for them? That would be really wicked decent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORT>
<DIRECTION>
The sheriff shoots him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.

	All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down behind his desk and picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sympathize with you kids. The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.

Everyone turns to look.

<DIRECTION>
TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is gripping the cell's bars. His eyes connect with Megan.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>

	You've got to convince the sheriff to look for your friends. Hopefully, they're fine. But there's a very good chance that Jason...

Megan, attracted to the good-looking prisoner, walks toward his cell.

	Jason who?

</MEGAN>
<SHERIFF>

	Megan, get away from him. He's dangerous.

She stops a few feet from the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>

	I'm not dangerous, believe me. Jason is out there. He's looking for me. But there's every possibility he'll return to the camp where it all started.

</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MEGAN
</DIRECTION>

She wants to argue, but the look in her father's eye tells her she'd better cool it. She takes one more look at Tommy as she approaches her father.

(wisecracking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't beat him up too bad, he's kinda cute.

On the door is closed, the steely-eyed sheriff leans in close to Tommy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>

	I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass. But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.

</SHERIFF>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(extremely concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

SHERIFF GARRIS

	We're gonna escort you and that shit-pile pickup of yours to the edge of my jurisdiction....

EXT. FOREST - DAY

A large clump of thick bushes. Someone's moving behind them. We TRACK along, following the rustles. It stops. We HOLD and WAIT. SUDDENLY THE BUSHES PART ABRUPTLY. A bespectacled little man in Army fatigues and camouflage makeup pokes his head out at us. ROY, wearing protective goggles, looks right- left, then hides back in the brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER AREA OF THE FOREST
</DIRECTION>

We follow TWO OTHER BUSINESSMEN decked out in green jungle fatigues, looking like out-of-shape Rambos. STAN and LARRY are both carrying handguns, watching for any movement around them. They, too, wear goggles.

WIDER ANGLE REVEALS

<DIRECTION>
BURT, a real Rambo/Commando clone in paint-splattered fatigues, whacks angrily at the brushes. Of all the would-be hunters, he looks like he takes the game almost too seriously. He wears a commando belt loaded with a survival knife, devil darts and his machete sheath. Like his partners, he too is a sore loser. As he hacks away, he mumbles curses about this "stupid game."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the machete higher as he attacks the defenseless bushes. SUDDENLY, A HORRIBLY DISFIGURED HAND GRABS HIS HAND, STOPPING THE MACHETE IN MID-SWING.

Shocked, Burt whips around, and gasps at the masked Jason.

A lone RV bounces and pumps to the beat of LOUD ROCK MUSIC within. Surrounded by a heavy fog, bright light beams from the windows of the mobile home. A cord extends from the vehicle and is plugged into the power outlet of this isolated trailer campground.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOBILE-HOME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEAVY-METAL MUSIC BLASTS as Cort and a savagely sexy girl, JILL, make love to the beat. With her on top, Cort is really getting his "bump in the night." He just lies back and enjoys he skilled technique.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE UP - ON JILL

She moans and bites her lip with erotic pleasure, never missing a beat with the music. Jill even bumps and grinds perfectly to the song's drum breaks.

Poor Cort's eyes widen. He'll never make it to the final chord.

We TRACK with Cort as he walks around the RV, watching everything around him. It's getting tense.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apprehensively, Cort approaches the cord and picks it up. He keeps staring out at the surrounding drifting fog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESSING IN ON CORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking at it, the jittery boy starts to plug in the cord. He then notices the torn-out plug and frayed cord. Cort gasps. He turns to call to Jill. HE BANGS INTO SOMEONE RIGHT BEHIND HIM...it's Jill.
</DIRECTION>
<JILL>

She cans the foggy night and a deadly fear now grips her. Slowly, then picking up speed, she follows after Cort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORT

has stopped in the RV's doorway. Jill rushes up, and turns to look at what he's staring at.

Not sure if it's a joke or her imagination, Paula slowly heads towards it. Tension mounts. Just as she reaches it, she slowly extends her hand to grab the knob.

Still nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NANCY
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME MEGAN AND TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tears are now flowing down Megan's cheeks. She knows her efforts are in vain. In frustration, she strikes his chest hard.

SUBJECTIVE MOVING CAMERA
</DIRECTION>

Slowly we HEAD between the tombstones, stalking the old caretaker, Martin. He is bent over, pulling weeds. We COME CLOSER and CLOSER, then finally stand towering over him. He senses us and turns around, STARTLED.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE ON MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs nervously to his feet, quickly dropping the weeds.

</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
OVER THE SHOULDER OF STRANGER - ON MARTIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we see is a dark suit and longish red-gray hair. The way Martin looks up at him, we know he is hiding true terror of this mysterious stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Er.. nice to see you again, Mr. Voorhees...Haven't seen you in Crystal...er, Forest Green, in quite some time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I've been takin' real good care of your wife and son's graves. Go look. You'll be real pleased.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Martin forces a grin to cover his fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MR. VOORHEES' HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reaches into his back pants pocket and withdraws a small wad of money. The gnarled hand gives it to Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN obsequiously accepts his payment. He practically genuflects before him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Mr. Voorhees. Thank you. I'll leave you in private, like you like. Okay, er...bye. Thank you.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAWN

Mr. Voorhees' black shoes head toward us and stop. Slowly, we TILT UP toward his face. Just as we reach his chest...

We recognize them from before.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE - FROM BEHIND HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands menacingly over his family's resting place...Does he sense something is wrong here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUP OF HIS EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare down at his son's grave. These eyes are truly evil. Cold. Dark. Demonic. Then the worst happens... They slowly look up at us. They seem to accuse us of knowing the true whereabouts of his son. AND HE WON'T STOP GLARING AT US.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE FOREST GREEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We GLIDE tranquilly over the blue water toward the middle of the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY MOVING IN on the water, it seems we are about to descend into it... JASON EMERGES AT US! We PULL BACK a bit. No, it's only his infamous MASK. Freed from it's wicked owner, it floats peacefully along old CRYSTAL LAKE... for now.
</DIRECTION>
