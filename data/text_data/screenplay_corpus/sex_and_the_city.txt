<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds perfect.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a great man friend.

She buries her head in his chest; relieved. He exhales.

<DIRECTION>
Miranda, Charlotte, Harry, Samantha, Smith, Stanford, Anthony, Bitsy and other GUESTS are gathered around a long beautifully-set table. Carrie and Big ARRIVE at the top of the stairs. Everyone looks up and applauds.

The desserts are being served. Samantha stands and prepares to speak. Harry hits a glass with a spoon... people quiet down.

From somewhere down the table, KARL (50) a Preppy Businessman CALLS OUT; joking.
</DIRECTION>
<KARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a word he's heard before!

The room LAUGHS. Big smiles; tight. Carrie leans in.

</CARRIE>
<BIG>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... here's to the groom. A man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

Big is touched. Then Karl feels the need to add:

</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to bother you all --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<BIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not bothering us.

</BIG>
<STEVE>

Samantha is trapped... trapped and touched.

</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
The guys go inside. Samantha gives Miranda a look and leads them away. Miranda turns. She glares at Steve.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't leave me any choice. You won't return my calls -- You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know I can't say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What could you possibly have to say that could make it better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<STEVE>

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Three YOUNG SINGLE GIRLS (25) walk past them into the club. They look back at the scene. Miranda looks down at the ground. Steve is paralyzed. Miranda turns to leave -- looks back at him with daggers and hurt.

Miranda makes her way through the crowded bar. She looks very rattled. Big spots her and follows, gently.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not alright. You two are crazy to get married. Marriage ruins everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda walks away, upset. He stands there; shaken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big is at the bar having a scotch. Carrie hurries over to him. She leans in and puts her arm on his back.

<CARRIE>

He looks at her as if to say something, then kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie sits on the bed surrounded by Charlotte, Samantha, and Miranda all wearing matching robes. Laying on the floor near the bed -- three open gift boxes and ribbons. Lily sits in Carrie's lap playing with Carrie's cell phone -- in her PJ's.

<BIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG>
<CARRIE>

She gestures to the wedding area. Miranda and Charlotte take Carrie's arms and quickly start moving her away. Horror on all of their faces. Brady CALLS after them, his voice ECHOES off the marble.

	Where you going, Mommy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRADY>

Samantha looks at Stanford and Anthony -- speechless.

Carrie looks up, and see's Big. He smiles an apologetically smile. Her limo keeps on moving. Big watches it go. Until...

<DIRECTION>
The limo SCREECHES to a halt. The back door flies open and Carrie almost leaps out. Big sees her, he looks relieved.
</DIRECTION>

She hurries up the street to Big's car holding her bouquet. Big gets out of his car just as Carrie reaches him.

He stops in his tracks. A WAITRESS (20's) at the Brant Park Cafe nearby "over-pours" water into a CUSTOMER'S glass -- riveted by the scene. Miranda and Charlotte move Carrie back into the limo. A CAB comes down the street and HONKS at Big standing in the road; dazed.

Carrie gently pushes the box away. Opens another.

Snow on the ground -- COLD. CROWDS gathered in front of the large fashion tent. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha trudge through the snow to the stairs. Samantha is wearing lots of fur. She SLIPS on some ice -- Carrie catches her.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And are you also suggesting that she forgive Big?

Elaine smiles and leaves. Carrie sits -- stunned; numb. She looks to the chairs across the runway -- FASHIONABLE WOMEN are looking back at her -- one or two smile sympathetically. She grabs her things and then turns to Charlotte.

Carrie stops -- turns around -- putting on her wrap.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was from your point of view.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>

<DIRECTION>
Carrie looks at her, hesitates, starts over to the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain pours down the windows. Carrie and Miranda sit in silence. A MIDDLE EASTERN DRIVER sits behind the wheel. CLOSE ON: THE METER. It reads 22.00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is weird not talking.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm upset.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. What were you going to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's forgiveness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda thinks -- Carrie looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And -- I know you're not the reason my marriage fell apart. I was just - desperate to have someone else to blame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda thinks. The METER clicks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steve and Miranda are sitting in front of a THERAPIST.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again.

</MIRANDA>
<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steve - you're very quiet today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THERAPIST>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me. But -- You made it hard for me to trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah -- I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks down at her hands. Steve looks at the therapist.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I know she won't punish me for the rest of my life?
	</DIALOGUE>

<THERAPIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't. And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you can know... is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other won't allow that to happen.

Silence.

Steve looks over at Miranda. Miranda looks at Steve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forsythia bushes are in bloom. Carrie and Miranda walk. They carry sandwiches.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thinking -- or feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very logical. And yet poetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poetic -- if we both show up. Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected. Not a good plan.
	</DIALOGUE>

Carrie walks in carrying a Starbucks cardboard caddy with two coffee. Louise is sitting at her desk, working.

Grey day. Samantha is sitting on the beach reading "The Secret."

<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>

She rolls her eyes, and tosses it down in the sand.

<DIRECTION>
Samantha walks on the beach. The dog is walking with her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Samantha had money, a career and a man who loved her... Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life.

The dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck.

Samantha is on the neighbor's deck looking for the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you, baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She rounds a corner -- and comes face to face with Dante -- showering in the outdoor shower. Water runs over his NAKED and PERFECT BODY. He sees her and smiles a hot smile. She is thrown -- overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick--

<DIRECTION>
(catching herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Deck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a GROWL sound. She looks -- the dog is humping a towel on the deck floor. She looks back at Dante.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to join me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the dog and hurries away. He calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Dante. Stop by -- anytime.

Samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone.

<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
Dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit. He unzips it while looking at Samantha. SAMANTHA dips a chip in guacamole and eats it. He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles at her. She dips another chip. He steps out of it and looks at her -- almost torturing her. She looks the other way, dips another chip in guacamole and eats it. Then another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone. She picks up a slice of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the window and looks out. Dante is on his deck putting on sun screen. He glistens. She chews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who is on his deck smoking a joint. He indicates for her to come over. She shakes her head: No. He walks away. She presses a button on the control panel. The jacuzzi jets start. She re- positions herself "on" them, then... She reaches over and grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and... starts eating it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone. On the table a legal pad with a list of PROS and CONS.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip on her cappuccino. As she stands up, she catches sight of herself in the mirrored wall. Cappuccino foam covers her top lip. She remembers. She knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda stands on the bridge. Alone. She looks at her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Just as this reality hits -- the CROWD parts and Steve is seen RUNNING up the bridge... towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda and Steve walk along the bridge towards Brooklyn.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Miranda never looked back...

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Steve and Miranda are making love -- it is passionate.

Miranda turns her head back to look at Steve.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me.

Carrie's apartment is transformed. It is sleeker, polished, more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And at home -- everything felt and looked different -- and yet still very much me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie -- BLONDE again -- walks out of the kitchen with Lilacs in a large vase. The door bell buzzes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with a very pregnant Charlotte.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. This is a very exclusive party.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes plus one...and a half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
WOMEN FRIENDS chatting and having fun. The front door is open and a coat rack is visible in the hall. A couple of WAITERS (20's) move around. ANTHONY comes up to Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTHONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A woman just put a glass down on your new desk without a coaster. I told her if she did it again I'd break her arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTHONY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>

<MIRANDA>

	Where's Samantha? Her plane landed two hours ago.

</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the dog is in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no place like home.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetie!

They kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a rat in your purse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that rat better be house trained.

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
A CATER WAITER walks over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CATER_WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I take your coat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATER_WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha nods and takes off her coat. Revealing: She has a belly. A very non-Samantha big fat gut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie looks at it. Miranda looks at it. Carrie and Miranda exchange looks. Charlotte comes running down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Samantha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha raises her arms to greet her. Her blouse rides up, the gut peeks out. Charlotte reacts; shocked.

	You have a -- dog!

</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
All three shake their heads: No.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are in the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, she has a belly. So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, a belly on anyone else is a "so what?" A belly on Samantha is a: "So what the hell is going on?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She never mentioned it on the phone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never. And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we even bring it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What -- like a fat intervention? "We love you -- have a salad?" No. We should let her bring it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock... Samantha opens the door. She's eating a piece of cake.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies, we can talk about my gut later-- right now, I'm bored to tears here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She gives them a look. They smile, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone has left. Samantha is sitting with Charlotte and Miranda and Carrie. They are having coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I eat -- so I won't cheat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What exactly are you eating?

</MIRANDA>
<SAMANTHA>

<CARRIE>

	Language, please -- this is a grown- up apartment now.

</CARRIE>
<SAMANTHA>

	I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How -- and I say this with love -- How could you not realize it?

<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been avoiding mirrors.

</SAMANTHA>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm proud of you for not cheating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if there's anything to be proud of. I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie reaches over and rubs Samantha's back.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you say something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I didn't want to admit it. And when you're in denial -- you don't dial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight. You'd be gorgeous at any size. But are you happy?

</CARRIE>

</SMITH>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it -- I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say -- I love you but I love me more. And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on.

<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry -- it's so much more complicated than you can imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but I'm just a big pile of love today --and I feel bad for the guy. He said he's been writing you -- but you never responded.

Carrie looks. Miranda, Charlotte, and a MORE SLENDER Samantha are standing there. They SCREAM and throw rice.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA_SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA_SAMANTHA>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mazel tov!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<DIRECTION>
As the rice hits... Carrie screams and Big laughs. A GUARD hurries over to them. Carrie is spitting out rice.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me -- excuse me! You're not allowed to throw rice anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, get over it -- It's New York!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She winks at the guard. He shrugs and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big, Carrie, Miranda, Steve, Brady, Charlotte, Harry, Lily, rose, Stanford, Samantha are casually gathered around a couple of tables that have been pushed together. A WAITRESS comes over balancing hot plates.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who had the ham and eggs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Big raises his arm. The waitress hands the plate down... Carrie intercepts it and places it in front of Big.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a fancy designer reception either. Just food and friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress hands out the other breakfasts. People LAUGH. Samantha feeds bacon to the dog -- who is wearing a tiny bridal veil on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie's books are displayed on a BOOK KIOSK. Carrie stands in front of it READING to a crowd from the galleys of her new book. She is wearing READING GLASSES.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe some labels are best left in the closet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bustling. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha -- back to her fighting weight -- walk down the busy street dressed for a night on the town. They laugh as they go -- their designer purses swinging.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Maybe when we put a label on people... bride, groom, husband, wife, fat, thin, married, single... we forget to look past the label and see the person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
They arrive at the club entrance. A line of PEOPLE wait to be let inside. The DOORMAN (30's) spots Carrie, lifts the red rope and lets the girls in -- closing it after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four girls sit at a table drinking "Cosmopolitans."
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLOTTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. This is delicious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLOTTE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did we ever stop drinking these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because everyone else started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<SAMANTHA>
<DIRECTION>
(sips; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that is an oldie but goodie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And speaking of an oldie but goodie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITER brings birthday cake to the table. The number: "50" stands proud and tall among the glowing candles. He places it down in front of a proud Samantha.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- wait -- a toast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
The girls lift their glasses to Samantha.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Samantha... fifty and fabulous!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha smiles, touched -- then blows out her candles.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To us... and the next fifty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha raise their glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the next fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
They sip and look at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there, in the same city where they met as girls, four New York women entered the next phase of their lives... dressed head to toe in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Samantha licks some icing. Charlotte cuts the cake. Miranda helps. Carrie smiles and sips.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's the one label -- that never goes out of style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
From outside we catch just a glimpse of Carrie and the girls at their table inside the busy club. The CAMERA starts to move away -- passing the line of PEOPLE waiting to get in. At the front of the line four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN stand waiting for the red rope to be lifted. As the CAMERA moves past them and UP -- the Doorman lifts the red rope and the twenty-something women SQUEAL with excitement and anticipation as they hurry inside. The CAMERA continues UP and UP and over the busy and exciting city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
