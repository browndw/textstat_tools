INT. ROOM - DAY (EFX)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIDEON, a strongly built elderly black man, is sitting at a table. On the table is a large bowl of fruit. A crocheted tablecloth hangs over the side of the table. Gideon is dressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well-polished wing-tip shoes. His hat almost covers his eyes, which are two points of greenish coals. The fruit in the bowl is engulfed in flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flames look as if they are DRIPPING from the tablecloth to the floor. Gideon's shoes start to SMOULDER. His shoes BURST INTO FLAMES which spread up his pants leg. His head falls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep. He twiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle. He crosses his legs as if to get comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves to a CLOSE UP of his burning shoes. The image of his feet begins to appear through his shoes; the flames fade; the background changes as we

EXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. Gideon is sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a Bible resting in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in South Central Los Angeles. Corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in the yard. Chickens scratch around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. He looks around and sees the chickens. He looks up at the sky and sighs, with some relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNNY, Gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching him from the back window of the house. He leaves the window.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their husbands. SUZIE, Gideon's wife, late 60's or early 70's, a picture of health, is giving a last bit of instruction before the class ends. Some of the people are already preparing to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, especially you men, that working together now will already have formed a bond before the child arrives. The woman is very sensitive.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the garden. He calls to them, but they don't respond. He puts his shoes on and walks towards the back door of the house. Entering the house, he stops and waits inside the door peeping out. In a sort of devilish manner he talks to himself.

	Spoiling the little foxes that spoil my vines.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shot of the backyard. Nothing. Suddenly, with the grace and suspicion of alley cats, kids jump over Gideon's back fence, look around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep voice. He turns the water on and walks over to the tree, trapping the kids. Dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try to scurry up the tree to safety. Gideon sprays the tree with water. Wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap the fence. Gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off his hands. He is quite pleased with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the wet kids is watching Gideon as he goes back inside the house. The boy signals the others who slowly follow in single file. They jump the fence and climb back up the tree. They let their half-eaten fruit fall to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out. Suzie looks at the picture before reading the letter. She tries to find a place for it among the other baby pictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser. Gideon comes in and starts to undress.

Sunny is asleep on the sofa with a half-eaten apple ready to fall out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GIDEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.

</GIDEON>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.

CLOSE UP OF BIRDS FLYING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the birds circle Skip's house, they do backward rolls and death grips. Skip throws more rocks to keep them flying. The rocks land on Gideon's roof.

	</DIALOGUE>

	I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BABE_BROTHER>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.

	Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<BABE_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BABE_BROTHER>

	All of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another. They were way down in the basement 'cause they figured no one would hear them. One of the preachers said, it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad I have been. You know them young gals that sit up in the first row. I can look at them and forget my text. I'm just lost when it comes to women, even them middle age sisters. Then another preacher said, I don't think I can tell you what my sin is 'cause it's bad.

Now ain't that a sin, lord. So all the preachers went on confessing, each one worst than the last. Finally they came to the last preacher who had been very quiet and listening to every word that fell. One of the preachers said to him, it's your turn. Confessing will lift you burden, Brother. Bare us your soul. We did. The last preacher said, no, my sin is the worst among all of you. One of the preachers said, ah go on man and stop all this suspense. So the last preacher said, like I told you my sin is the lowest.

	That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.

A group of Men who haven't seen each other in years are asking questions about news of old friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Okra is trying to get his camera working.

	You folks excuse me but you know we have a celebrity from out of the past, our own nightingale. If you had any good times in your life, you remember Hattie.

<GIDEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, how come me and Suzie have to be mother and father to your child? You never take the boy to the park, circus or anything. If we did not take him to church, he wouldn't have any sense of religion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn't understand is not saving his soul. When he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion, that will be better. It will be his intellectual decision.
	</DIALOGUE>

<GIDEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the way your parents raised you?

</BABE_BROTHER>
<GIDEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON>
<BABE_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.

	He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<BABE_BROTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.

	Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

M.C. and Okra come in wanting to take pictures. Marsh is pretty mad about them intruding. M.C. sets the naked lamp in front of Marsh, on the floor, almost between his legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Okra can get his camera set to shoot, Marsh leaves. Harry smiles as if he had won a major victory. Herman flops down in the empty chair and starts to COUGH.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, Loviray. They carry the twin towards Herman's seat. Herman is slow to react. Herman gets up very slow. Finally, they are able to seat the twin.

Suzie is standing on the steps, shouting to Harry. The noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out Suzie's voice. Not getting Harry's attention, she hurries down the steps.

Harry has caught a hen that is SCREAMING her head off. He looks around and finds Suzie hurrying towards him.

	He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
