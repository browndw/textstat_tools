</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS can be heard from a second floor balcony. DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and dials. Beat. Into phone --

<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last delivery's finally here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard references the sounds from upstairs --

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside. Handing over the satchel and heading out --
</DIRECTION>
<ARMORED_TRUCK_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it real.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator doors slide closed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to a walk-in vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of the vault. A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading the cart into the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A train arrives. People jostle on and off. One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser. Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap over his shoulder. The train doors begin to close. When... A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed. Intense. Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the platform into the tunnel and disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the door, securing the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high- voltage third rail. Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him. Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him back up and away from the danger.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miles nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>

<DIRECTION>
Miles nods again, and they set off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and scans the security monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man in the suit riding up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Douglas settles back in with his magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint. Fait starts to open it. Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall. Press their backs against it as tightly as they can. The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts and rights, following more spray paint. They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray- painted circle.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>

:SC: INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music, just STATIC. Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the phone.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to the park. The top floor is at street level. Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's an eight-story drop. Su faces in. And then... Hops backward off the roof. Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then lets go. Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto the balcony.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - FRONT DOOR A limo pulls up outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a short, tight dress emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She approaches the security station. Up close, in the light, Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here for the reception.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Name, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Angie Rawlins.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Douglas scans a list of names. Checks off hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. You can go on up. Front elevator, to the mezzanine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I hate these things. Don't you hate these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just here to do my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria looks back at Douglas. Studies him a moment. Liking what she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then again, you never know who you're going to meet...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage. Then leans over the desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet you're a lot more fun than any of those boring people upstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Douglas is unaffected. Just looks at her blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, ma'am. I have a job to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her. Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARIA'S POV The magazine is Genre. Males for males. Buff boys. Big pecs, big penises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Daria steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I suppose I should go up and see what they're selling.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as Daria walks toward Tommy: She whispers into a hidden mike --
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change of plans. He's gay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy hears it over his earwig.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah way.

INTERCUT WITH:

</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy. Your turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A look of alarm on Tommy's face. Into his mike --
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't a conversation. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It's an order. Tommy knows he has to. Shit.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Key-card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAIT>
<DIRECTION>
Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you keep my purse? I shouldn't be too long.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him. Then heads toward the elevator, as... Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Aloha.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20 thru 28.) Douglas looks up from his magazine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you don't take offense at this... but I just have such a weakness for a man in uniform.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that's your thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uniform's definitely my thing. I mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking, mmm, seafood. Y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not actually supposed to be
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	talking on duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's talking? Honey, this is a flirting... But you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women. World's full of fools.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have- A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm not too cute for you. And don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm hooked up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another big, hot, cuddly, black love- Jesus got there first. That bitch. Taking you. From me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I can appreciate the monogamy. Saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me. Even if you are just breaking my heart... Guess I'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can be pretty rough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you get me all excited now. I was just learning to accept my disappointment.

Tommy sticks out his hand.

Shaking hands --

<DOUGLAS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks away. Scans the monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - MONITORS Everything looks normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault, Tommy relaxes.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll leave you alone. But is it okay if I just stand here and stare at the muscles I'll be missing for the rest of my life?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OFF which...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's attention. He does. Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the controls to go down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY who furtively flips her the bird. Never missing a beat with Douglas.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's attention diverted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan, Fait films the room. When he's done....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera, Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy continues diverting Douglas's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves equipment bags through the hole in the floor. Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault door. Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door. Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside. A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal canister of liquid nitrogen. Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault door. The outside frosts over. Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.

Miles moves down the rows of drawers, using a tool to pop all the locks. Fait and Daria follow behind, quickly pulling out the drawers and emptying jewels into nylon bags. Fait empties drawer after drawer. All white diamonds. When... He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds. And stops, admiring them.

During which, just above them... Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down. She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She looks back at him in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY running toward the rear of the stopped train. Leaping onto the rear steps. When... Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in front of him.

<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to come and get 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILES>
<DIRECTION>
Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous. Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches from their heads. Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The car takes a wide curve. Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip. Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off the train. Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts out both hands as far as he can. And... Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait lets her go, they both die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it, increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws the bag down, cursing in Chinese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop. Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag of black diamonds. Still has them. Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand, they melt into the crowd of commuters.

The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and evading the ferocious attack dogs. Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off Fait.

	... I mean, hey, I coulda resisted, sure -- and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever -- but then, see, I'm thinking: How would I be able to tell Tony what happened to the stones? Right? What good am I dead or on life-support. So I threw in the towel. Reluctantly, of course. For your sake.

Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV. Turns it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as... Charles slams the door shut. Locks it. And... Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark camper. Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it. A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the fear go away, but giving her strength.

:SC: INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until they reach the last cell. The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries. Hanging blankets cloak the cell entirely from view. Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...

:SC: INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as Joel's office. JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the terms of his incarceration. Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS, sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries; French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler and the daily mail.

Chickens is happy. Thrusts the knife at Fait. When... Su reaches out and catches the blade. Catches it with just the thumb and forefinger of one hand. And holds it like that. Holds it hard. Chickens can't push and can't pull. Doesn't know what to do next. Finally yanks really hard. And... Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A beat. Then, to Fait --

<SONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tape her up and gag her.

As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van, unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it. Then opens the door. And... Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his waist.

<CHARLES>

	Get the hell off me.

<DIRECTION>
He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Waste of time... I can think of a better way of shutting you up --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads. Charles howls in pain and lets her go. Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes the remote. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key and remote are gone.

CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the can...

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men. Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility: at the door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc. ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>

<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got trouble?

<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... With a capital 'T.'

<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony Fait? Thought you and him were tight. Bonnie and Clyde.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be that way. Not treating me right these days. The kid's all he cares about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What do you want me to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't know what I was thinking. I shouldn't even be here like this. Sorry, Odion.

<DIRECTION>
Daria starts to go. Odion stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in the day... Just always seemed like you and I had something special between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't know you thought so.

<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always cared for you, Odion. That's why I'm here.

<ODION>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So maybe you could work here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the best. Not many girls pulling in two g's a night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it's been a while for that... Might not remember how.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like a bicycle, baby. You don't forget that stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria considers it a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know how Jump'd feel about it. Having me back.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Daria knows the look in his eyes. Gets the subtext.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Just talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Odion's drinking her in.
</DIRECTION>
<ODION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into Odion's, smiling at him --

:SC: INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY Su and Archie.
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have boxing matches in the day?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly boxing. More dangerous. No gloves. No rules. Big money. Very illegal... Started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man you remembered -- how do you know he will be here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How will you recognize him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't see his face. But I'll know his pinkie ring when I see it. Ten carats. Round cut with square mount. Good color and clarity. I remember thinking what it would do to my face if he hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to help disguise himself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a gate to the fight arena beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we get in?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave that to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, to the Guard --
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, man, how you doing? Got a fighter here I want to enter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Su shoots him a surprised look.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there and get all Chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run... Gonna be fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever... You're number twelve, Bruce.

<DIRECTION>
He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make their way toward the arena --
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't come here to fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't have to. That was just to get us in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men. Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos. A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room. Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the shit out of each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like at a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of plastic over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch lands, the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to shield themselves from flying blood.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, over a million dollars'll pass hands in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find the ring.

<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Okay.

He looks around. Lotta African-American males.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>

<DIRECTION>
As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands, and Su follows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him back toward a sofa.

Odion sits.

Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO. Cranks up some HIP-HOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. Something slower.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Odion SWITCHES MUSIC. A SLOW TUNE fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good... Now just relax... And watch...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy. And Odion's eating it up.

<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, that burns my ass right to the bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my job... Anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? How come?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>

<TOMMY>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Doorman considers it another moment. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Let's do this. You let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of the room. The door opens. The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Look. At. This.

:SC: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away. Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it. BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs and toss them out. As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something bigger. BLEEE. He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Safe.

</DIRECTION>
<ODION>

	Keep it in your pants.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY CRASH! Odion and his men break down the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones. Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And then...
</DIRECTION>

Whereupon we see who he's talking to: Ling.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like foreplay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much money do you want for the stones?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up drills -- girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points. Bring it straight to the motherfucking hoop. You understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, instead of us going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for you to think of a number. A very high number. A very final number. A number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when I hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time. Still isn't looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And... Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a big man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the blood and swelling --
</DIRECTION>
<CHAMBERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay...
	</DIALOGUE>

Ling stops.

<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.

	You're after the stones, too, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No response from Su. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em... Guess who get back to me? My Defense Department connection. Now, I think he's calling me about this surplus F- 14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands on. But no. Turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan about black stones --

<DIRECTION>
In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the midget calls out --

	Twelve's right here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Su pulls his arm back.
</DIRECTION>
<FIGHT_CLUB_FAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be scared of him, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUISER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, chickenshit!

<DIRECTION>
Su waves them off.

The catcalls start. Archie leans into Su.

<ARCHIE>

	I know it wasn't the plan. But if you don't fight, they're gonna toss us out on our asses. We might never find the guy.

:SC: INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To Odion, as they pass him --

<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK His cuffed hands. Fingers feeling the inside of his belt. Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out recess in the belt. Where... Fait has a hidden handcuff key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS struggling against their duct-tape bonds. REVEAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAMPER - DAY Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON nearby, but she's not watching. Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape. Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight leaves his corner and advances on Su. Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment, gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and misses. Until... Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch carries him headfirst into a metal post. Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight, Su uses the chance to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHIE still checking out the hands of African-American men in the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SU Number eight's on his feet. Moving in again. When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHIE Suddenly, he sees it. The ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SU dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight. Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You win.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's path.
</DIRECTION>
<RING_ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No quitting. Get back in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOT DOG STAND - DAY Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two extreme MOTO-RIDERS dressed in leathers have pulled up in a truck and gotten out to eat. In the back of the truck is a motorcycle and a four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle Daria. To her --
</DIRECTION>
<MOTO_RIDER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores them. To each other, so she can hear --

:SC: INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --

A Cop calls inside to Fait.

Fait stands. Starts out. Into his mike --

<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get ready to move.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And we see... The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Fait reaches the rear doorway. When... He jumps. Knocks one Cop down. Shoves another aside. And takes off running. Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others by car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand. To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the car. Stay close.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION. The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTO_RIDER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck. Right through the nylon mesh tailgate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels. As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto- Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
</DIRECTION>
<MOTO_RIDER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let that fucker get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in pursuit.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets, sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't. Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's fast, strong and maneuverable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One problem: so is the moto-cross bike. The guy's right on Fait's ass. Matching move with move. Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path. But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure. This'll be a news highlight for days to come.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su versus the five fighters. And the midget. The different fighters use different fighting styles against Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street fighting... Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a fighting staff. One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY Fait's everywhere. And so is the moto-bike. Still on his tail. Fait veers inside a building. The bike follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs. One floor. Two floors. Up and up. Fait reaches the top-floor hallway. Nowhere left to go except... Out the window at the end. And... That's just where he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap. Onto the roof of a next-door building. From there, it's rooftop to rooftop. Jump after jump. Longer and longer. Until... The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH. The moto- rider walks away, but his chase is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

<FAIT>

	Get there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY It's down to Su and the kick boxer. The kick boxer spins and kicks and punches, and... Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes. Ties him into a pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then... Looks for Archie. Can't find him. Can't find the guy wearing the ring. And hurries out of the cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance. Up the spiral ramp.

Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.

Vanessa notices something about the car. Looks carefully. When... The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle of the people inside, and... Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy. Which could mean only one thing: her daddy's safe. And soon he'll be coming to get her. With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape, Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct- tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless again, her eyes go to... Her necklace. The chain and pink diamond pendant. Vanessa bends over and lowers her head until the necklace slides off onto the bed. Then turns around and picks up the necklace behind her back. Holding it as taut as she can between her hands, she begins sawing away at the tape around her wrists.

</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Chambers' guys. I don't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and listen. Hear nothing. Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look. Then Su opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find... Odion and the other Chambers' men. Dead. Skull shot.

<DIRECTION>
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain, where he reaches into the water and begins searching the rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --

Su doesn't answer, still searching.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. This can't fucking happen. They gotta be there.

Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up: one black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>

<SU>

<SU>

Beat. Failure. Summed up in one word:
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vanessa...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, trying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has the stones. There's no reason to keep her. Hell, she's a little girl, she's eight years old -- she can't hurt him. He can let her go... He can just fucking let her go...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Su just looks at him. Not a chance. And he knows Fait knows it, too. It's over. For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What the hell am I gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... We need to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage, and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of exotica, destroying it. Beat. Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<SU>

Then tries to figure out what to do next. Begins searching the camper for anything that might help her escape or fight. When... Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and... The phone turns on. Sort of. CLOSEUP - CELL PHONE

An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new arrivals.

In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair. Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one to three bodyguards. Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING... Charles standing nearby. Too close for her to escape.

	You're the world's foremost arms dealers. You all know that weaponry equals power. And in the world of weaponry, nukes rule. But nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle... But what if it weren't?... That's the question that brought you here tonight... And here's the answer.

Ling holds up a single stone.
</DIRECTION>
<LING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In its present state, it's completely inert. Zero radiation, zero volatility...

<DIRECTION>
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard with a mallet. He unfolds the velvet. The stone's smashed to pieces. Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then inserts the capsule into his contraption.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goggles on.
	</DIALOGUE>

Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver of stone, which begins to glow. Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical readout on the contraption races up the scale --

<DIRECTION>
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators. Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market- analysis for Sona to consult. The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel out the situation.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HANGAR Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the other, carrying the buyers away. The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a bodyguard. Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
</DIRECTION>
<LING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. HANGAR Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. AIRFIELD The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. AGUSTA As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process, he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AGUSTA Ling hears the THUMPS. Looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LING'S POV - SU'S LEG swinging beneath the Agusta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LING To the pilot --
</DIRECTION>
<LING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Retract the gear!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL The pilot hits the wheels-up switch. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SU The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot it down! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And then... Su lets go. Drops fifteen feet to the ground. As... Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TANK Archie aims the cannon.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you hit it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem. Absolutely... Load.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy slides a shell into the breech.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archie's locked on. He hits the trigger. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABRAMS TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! The big CANNON FIRES. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SKY The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archie and Tommy exult.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shot him right in the ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did it. I can't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you said it was no problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from crashing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. AIRFIELD The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac, ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING INTO FLAMES. The spilled fuel ignites. A circle of intense fire. With Su in the middle. The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside. Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones. Su is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<LING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were lucky last time. You Won't be lucky again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The final fight begins. The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire, using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death. For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until... Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
</DIRECTION>
<LING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll kill you fast. You won't Feel a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I won't. You will
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
What happens next happens in an instant: Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms. Wrenches it. A direction it can't go. Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP. Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from Ling's pocket. And... Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags, choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror- stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment. Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for our friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE LING'S THROAT The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand microwave ovens turned on all at once. Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE BACK ON LING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks from the inside out. Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his skeleton. Human jerky. In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains topple over. Su has closed a chapter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in b.g. The two men regard each other a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got it all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens to the stones?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive in b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like I'll be doing some jail time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jail? Man, you just helped save the planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A look between Fait and Su. Su nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do what I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a helluva team, y'know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Su)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not you, 'cause you're law enforcement. But the rest of us -- look, a white guy comes in handy now and then. Y'know, if you're pulling a job in Beverly Hills or ripping off a country club or whatever... What kind of percentage are we talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fait looks at Vanessa again. Finding a new purpose in her eyes. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time I got real.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He regards the others.
</DIRECTION>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time we all did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get real? What's that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Means we're through with that life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's. Beat. Tommy nods. Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm with you, T.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to Miles.
</DIRECTION>
<MILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fait looks back to Su. They hold the look.
</DIRECTION>
<SU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you're all gonna go straight, just like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe oughta try it yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Are you kidding? I've had straight jobs. You ever had a
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	straight job?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had plenty of straight jobs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Name one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sold Avon door-to-door.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... You were an Avon lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was an Avon man. You got a problem with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's just, well, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my momma did it, and don't you dare start disrespecting my momma...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And so on... OFF which, we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
