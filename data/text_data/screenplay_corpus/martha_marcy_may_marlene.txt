<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway. She carries a small bag.

Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently yells out: "MARCY MAY"

Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.
