<DIRECTION>
We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The financial district. Lots of people in suits. A shaky, spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter. He starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Foley goes inside, we then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING FOR MONEY?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION while he studies the bank layout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business area at the front. An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes hands with the man and they both sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.
</DIRECTION>
<TELLER_LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I help you, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLER_LORETTA>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Loretta, you see that guy talking to your manager, has his case open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly, begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant managers. Our manager is Mr. Schoen, but he's not in today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you see the guy with the attache case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
(looks again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my partner. He has a gun in there. And if you don't do exactly what I tell you, or you give me any kind of a problem, I'll look over at my partner and he'll shoot your Mr. Guindon between the eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now take one of those big envelopes and put as many hundreds, fifties and twenties as you can pack into it. Nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. I don't want any dye packs. I don't want any bait money. Start with the second drawer and then the one over there, under the computer. Come on, Loretta, the key's right there next to you. No bills off the bottom of the drawer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she works)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First time being robbed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing great. Just smile, Loretta, so you won't look like you're being held up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the way, you're doing fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the front door. When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, give me the twenties. I'll put 'em in my pocket. Okay, I haven't had to give my partner a sign; that's good. Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds till after I'm out the door, make sure you haven't set off the alarm. If you have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon between the eyes. Okay? I think that'll do it. Thank you, Loretta, and have a nice day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<LORETTA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORETTA>
<DIRECTION>
Foley heads for the door. He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk, looks back at Loretta. Foley smiles at her, then turns to the Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's cute, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks across the bank at Loretta.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yeah, I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Foley winks at Loretta and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Foley tries to start the car. No go. He tries again.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
But the car won't start. Foley bangs on the wheel...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open window into Foley's ear...
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you flooded it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling, now has his gun pointing at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out've the car, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_COP>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna hear a funny story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<SECOND_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up and get out've the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_COP>
<DIRECTION>
And as Foley obliges, we then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a MAN GRUNT. Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as we realize he's on his way to the rim when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BASKETBALL GAME in progress. All of the men, Foley included, are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts. The game is rough. Hair is pulled. Eyes are poked. Faces punched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION. BELLE GLADE, FLORIDA."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley is the oldest player here. He's getting tired, starts to lose his breath. He finally walks off the court, breathing so hard he can't even talk. He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT to come in and take his place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath. He looks across the yard to where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards. All of them are over sixty. One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal Mal and Lucky Strike packs. Another tends to a tomato bush in a tiny patch of garden near the wall. Another one sits nearby painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches his eye. He watches as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO LATINO MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop and begin stretching out. One of them nods to Foley. Foley nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<PUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want something, Foley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUP>
<DIRECTION>
Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<PUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many?

</PUP>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.

</FOLEY>
<PUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. How many going out?

</PUP>

</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting at a table full of other little Latins. CHINO -- fifties, in shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down with a bunch of bikers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MESS - DAY

Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette. He puts an arm around Lulu, starts to walk off...

<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today's the day, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next thing to having him on a leash.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You excited?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you think is today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice. But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five. Saving yourself for the main event. Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Chino and Lulu exchange looks.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley. I like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>

Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.

<FOLEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what, you finish ahead of schedule?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see what they doing, those posts out there? Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there. We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days. So we going soon as it's dark. You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate the offer. And it's tempting.

Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence not twenty yards away.

<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, man, it's a long run to civilization. A hundred miles to Miami? I'm too old to start acting crazy, try a stunt like that. You make it out, send me a postcard.

</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: A NOTEPAD

	And the one driving the other car?

	What're you talking about?

</FOLEY>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two. He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.

INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk. He looks about the cell. All he's got to show for himself. It's now quiet on the cellblock. Foley closes his eyes and we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY. LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA. And then... TWO YEARS AGO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black, Foley's age, shaved head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as does Maurice. GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades -- counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the fighter's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's gonna send this guy out in a body bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking as those around him. The guy looks nervous, can feel the other cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet. Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling. Foley turns and watches the fight now...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone ever tell you why they call him Snoopy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy shakes his head. Maurice dances around the other guy now. Teases him.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back when he was pro. Now you pet him, he goes down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely glances off Maurice's jaw. Sure enough, Maurice makes a big show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons. He throws a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning technique...
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight. Fuckin' pathetic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one hand thrust into his pocket. Foley watches as Maurice stops the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the fights -- as he comes out into the yard.
</DIRECTION>

	It's Richard Ripley.

	The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize him without his rug.

<GLENN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, anybody that can write a check for fifty mil, he says anything I'm all fucking ears. Like the other day, he tells me how he's got all this money in foreign banks, plus around five mil in uncut diamonds at his house. He said, quote, "Where I can put my hands on it anytime."

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks to him as they walk into the block...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.

A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman is opening her trunk before coming forward...
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.

Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the chapel, eyes on the floor, listening...

<PUP>

	I don't hear 'em. Where's the tunnel come out?

Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of the pews to a window.

Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it smack against the side of Pup's head. Drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there, crouching down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen turns on her headlights. No, not crouched. The guy is coming out of the ground. On this side of the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the ground. Right in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised there for a moment before taking off into the dark. Karen gets out of the car...

INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

<DIRECTION>
As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before the men disappear into the dark.
</DIRECTION>

Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her trunk...
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing?

	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds, start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark, then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate, to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it for the cons. They take off running...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't fire...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more interested in the hole the convicts had come out of. Now they're standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited, pointing towards the orange grove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to see if they're alive, then keep going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out. He takes his time, puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the shotgun on Buddy. Buddy raises the palm of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, honey, we're good guys.

</BUDDY>
<KAREN>

	What're you doing here?

</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when they're already pretty sure what you're doing. She glances around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence, past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange grove. A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet that's all the hacks they send out. Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we talk about it later?

He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious thought, but what he says is...

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk. She's reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're cuddled up in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the gun in his face. Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then everything goes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK

<DIRECTION>
Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing. Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.

Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite directions as she begins firing from the inside...

A sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment of the overpass. When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.

Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.

Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.

Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock Foley in the head when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand, like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back-first with a loud thud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A WHISTLE. They all freeze, look to...

He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into Ripley's open hand. Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a fist, crushing the fish. He taps his fist to Ripley's.

Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with Himey. Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at Foley.

Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub, then she's in the doorway, looking down at...

	And what happened to Carl?

<BURDON>

	So the woman's married. She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it. But you don't reveal her name, you protect her. It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it. Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.

<MARSHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone. Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon. Tell her you think he's a nice guy. No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her? I bet nothing. So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out. You think that's possible? What kind of guy is he?

	Foley kidnapped me.

	Huh. Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks. It's all he's ever done.

	Did you know that when you married him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he was a card player. I could live with that. I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce. He said, "Okay." Jack's so easy going.

	Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start. Battery was dead. He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<ADELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after. She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes through one of the glass panels. Adele and Karen both jump as Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob...

...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm still sticking through the glass...

Foley looks at Glenn. Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously. Foley smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard. Now Maurice starts laughing. Buddy, too. White Boy's lost, looking from one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile going away as he says...

EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier. Now it's a CRIME SCENE. A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers stand just behind the yellow tape. A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly- freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.

Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk. She pauses to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hell. Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in the doorway. Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the chest. He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Congealed blood runs down the stairs. COPS and CRIME SCENE TECHS are everywhere. Karen looks at the guy on the stairs.
</DIRECTION>

She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing. Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.
</DIRECTION>
<CRUZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?

	What'd you fight, middleweight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<KENNETH>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Like to get down and tussle a little bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle. I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you." And I give Tuffy what every dog love best. You know what that is? A bone.

Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.

<KENNETH>

Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip on a golf club. Kenneth grins at her...

	<DIALOGUE>
	What else you have in there, mace? Have a whistle, different kinds of female-protection shit?

Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go, Kenneth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's like a golf club grip.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>

She steps aside and brushes past him. He grabs her left wrist...
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gonna tussle first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots out of the grip. She pulls an arm's length away from him and chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking away...

<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>

He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<FOLEY>

<FOLEY>

	Let fate decide? What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sister believes in fate, but not hell. That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty suit and tie.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HEARN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in Miami. How's that sound to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HEARN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley...
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HEARN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're about a 42 long, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HEARN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering. Foley looks at the desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the- bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HEARN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's see how she fits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HEARN>
<DIRECTION>
Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<MR_HEARN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your uniform.

</MR_HEARN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My what?

Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one arm. Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...

Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist right behind him now.
</DIRECTION>
<RIPLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack? Whoa-- what's the problem? Take it easy, let's talk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIPLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a PANIC BUTTON beneath his desk...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A security guard? Are you fucking kidding me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ripley considers Foley a moment, then...
</DIRECTION>
<RIPLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up. But I was pretty sure that, if you did, you'd throw the job in my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understand something, Jack. Up to this point, everything you've done with your life means absolutely nothing in the real world. Less than nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIPLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<RIPLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a bank robber. This is not a marketable skill. There are no old bank robbers out in the world living on pensions. You know this. That's why you're here right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIPLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Still Foley says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<RIPLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage. You think you're better than that? Fine. Show me. Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better. But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIPLEY>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How, Dick? The way you earned it? By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her? What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit? Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks. You were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing. Till you were nothing. I saved your ass. So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there." Okay, Dick? I can't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<RIPLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, I'm disappointed. I guess I misjudged you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIPLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Two massive SECURITY GUARDS appear in the doorway...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what job he promise you guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's two ways we can do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? What are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<RIPLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen. I think we've calmed down now. Haven't we, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIPLEY>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, I'm calm. In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."

</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH) and wings it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIPLEY'S BUILDING - FLORIDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two guards. He picks himself up. He kicks at the guards, who wave him off, go back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The one from the opening. Foley looks at it a moment, then calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he starts across the street...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of Karen he tore out of the morning paper. He's written the name "WESTIN" on it.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow. Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and I better call my sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: THE SNOWSTORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's really coming down. We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of the Westin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to an adjacent table.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack Daniel's, please, water on the side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above the city, down there somewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_GUY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Celeste, do us again, please, and put the lady's drink on our bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_GUY_S_VOICE>

She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling, pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks anyway.

</KAREN>
<WAITRESS>

</WAITRESS>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get that. Tell them I'd rather pay for my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress delivering the message. Then they look at Karen. She gives them a shrug, turns to watch the snow. Her drink arrives. She takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. My associates and I made a bet on what you do for a living.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
She glances at the table, the other two watching.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd like to just have a quiet drink and leave. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<PHILIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you want to know what I guessed? How I know what you do for a living?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHILIP>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly curious. Really, I don't want to be rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to the snowstorm. She sees his reflection turn and leave. A moment later, the next one appears at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_GUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I know why you're depressed -- if I may offer an observation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_GUY_2>
<DIRECTION>
She just looks at him. So sure of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_GUY_2>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a hunch you're the new sales rep and your customer isn't exactly knocked out by the idea of a young lady, even one as stunning as you, handling the account. Am I close? Hi, I'm Andy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EXECUTIVE_GUY_2>
<DIRECTION>
She says nothing to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're ad guys. We flew in from New York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker Distillery, present this test-market campaign for their new margarita mix. What we do, we show this guy who looks like a Mexican bandido, you know, with the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--

<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy? Really. Who gives a shit?
	</DIALOGUE>

He gives her a sympathetic expression.

<ANDY>

</ANDY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beat it, will you?

</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the guy until he turns away. She sips her drink, stares once more out at the blizzard. After a few moments, another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I buy you a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Boom. Not one of the executive guys. She stares at the reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'd love one.

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to sit down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the chair out, looking at her. The three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down. Foley offers his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Gary.

</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates, then shakes his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Celeste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles with him. When she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers. She watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his. The tips of her fingers brush his knuckles, lightly back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>

	It's your game. I've never played this before.

	Well, does it make sense to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't have to, it's something that happens. It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?" It might happen only a few times in your life.

<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I remembered you. I came looking for you. I would've said sure, let's do it. But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team. Why would you trust me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be worth the risk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like taking risks.

</KAREN>
<FOLEY>

She shrugs, lets it go. He puts down his drink, kisses her. She lets him, then moves to the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</KAREN>
<FOLEY>

</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (unbuttoning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.

</FOLEY>
<KAREN>

	He killed a police officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>

</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, decides to get off this subject. Anyway he's finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands inside her shirt. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that Sig .380 you took was my favourite. My father gave it to me.

</DIRECTION>

	What were you gonna do with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You waved to me in the elevator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't sure you caught that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't believe it. I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. Like if we could take a time-out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>

<FOLEY>

</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So she did help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think we should get into that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're right. Or Buddy. I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit. Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk like that, okay? You scare me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.

<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna leave your tie on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him, standing close to help him with the tie...
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck again and then as she turns off the light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him. He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You having fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes open, serious now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's lying in Jack's arms. She looks at him a moment, then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>

She comes in. Looks at herself in the mirror. Suddenly feels self-conscious. She grabs a bathrobe off the door.

INT. BEDROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the ceiling. She comes out again and stands looking down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to know something. I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you mad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about my motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the covers, but she just stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin. He scores some cash off a teller, he's on his way out when he drops the bottle. It shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him. The nitro was canola oil. I know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing. I doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one. Most bank robbers are fucking morons. To go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd have to be as dumb as they are. I know you're not dumb, so why would I think that? Why would you think I might think that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
She comes over and sits down on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not dumb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about that. You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>

They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him. He senses this, looks at her...

</KAREN>
<FOLEY>

</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.

INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen comes into the room tying her robe. She looks at the coffee table where...

Buddy turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she saw you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, she did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how I felt about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you give her a jump? If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't about getting laid. I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You find out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<FOLEY>

</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee.

INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ring set up on stage. Men hang out on the side. Where movie seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through the theatre to the bar. Rap music booms out of speakers as fighters are announced.

<GLENN>

<DIRECTION>
He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White Boy Bob. But before he can grab them...

<WHITE_BOY_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you telling us for? You want somebody to hold your little pecker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_BOY_BOB>

Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot. Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.
